Abstract = {Considerable efforts are being made worldwide to replace in vivo assays
   with instrumental methods of analysis for the monitoring of marine
   biotoxins in shellfish Analysis of these compounds by the preferred
   technique of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   is challenged by matrix effects associated with the shellfish tissues In
   methods validation assessment of matrix interferences is imperative to
   ensure the validity and accuracy of results being produced Matrix
   Interferences for the analysis of okadaic acid (OA) and azaspiracid 1
   (AZA1) were assessed using acidic methods on electrospray triple stage
   quadrupole (TSQ) and hybrid quadrupole time of flight (QToF) instruments
   by the use of matrix matched standards for different tissue types Using
   an acidic method no matrix interference and suppression was observed on
   the TSQ for OA and AZA1 respectively whilst the opposite was observed on
   the QToF matrix enhancement for OA and no matrix interference for AZA1
   The suppression of AZAs on the TSQ was found to be due to interfering
   compounds being carried over from previous injections The degree of
   suppression is very much dependant on the tissue type ranging from 15 to
   70\% Several strategies were evaluated to eliminate these interferences
   including the partitioning of the extract with hexane optimisation of
   the chromatographic method and the use of on-line SPE Hexane clean up
   did not have any impact on matrix effects The use of an alkaline method
   and a modified acidic method eliminated matrix suppression for AZA1 on
   the TSQ instrument while an on-line SPE method proved to be effective
   for matrix enhancement of OA on the QToF (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins are sodium channel activator toxins responsible for
   ciguatera fish poisoning. In this study, we determined the toxicokinetic
   parameters of the Pacific ciguatoxin P-CTX-1 in rats after an
   intravenous (iv) dose of 0.13 ng P-CTX-1 per g of body weight. The
   ciguatoxin activity was assessed over time in blood using the sensitive
   functional Neuro2a assay. The data were analyzed with a
   two-compartmental model. After exposure, the ciguatoxin activity
   exhibited a rapid (alpha half-life of 6 min) and extensive distribution
   into tissues (apparent steady state volume of distribution of 7.8 L).
   Ciguatoxin elimination from blood was slower with a beta half-life
   estimated at 35.5 h. The toxicokinetic parameters determined from this
   study were compared to data previously obtained after oral and
   intraperitoneal exposure of rats to 0.26 ng P-CTX-1 per g of body
   weight. Maximal bioavailability was determined by the area under the
   concentration curve, and was used to calculate the absolute P-CTX-1
   bioavailabilities for oral and intraperitoneal routes of exposures of
   39\% and 75\%, respectively. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Batch cultures of the toxigenic diatom Nitzschia pungens Grunow f.
   multiseries Hasle were fed to blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and deep sea
   Atlantic scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to elucidate conditions
   under which domoic acid (DA) was accumulated and excreted (depurated).
   Mussels accumulated the toxin to a maximum level of 13 mug g-1, at rates
   of 0.21 to 3.7 mug h-1 g-1 dry weight. Accumulation efficiency (the
   proportion of accumulated DA to estimated net uptake) ranged from 1-5\%.
   The highest filtration rate of 1.7 l h-1 occurred at concentrations of
   4-8 x 10(6) Nitzschia cells l-1 with no formation of pseudofeces.
   Depuration rates between fed and starved mussels over a 2 h test period
   were the same. The depuration rate of domoic acid was about 17\% d-1 and
   did not account for the low uptake efficiencies, so it is suggested that
   most of the DA is lost from mussels in the solution during the feeding
   process. Domoic acid accumulation in mussels was dependent on the amount
   of toxin available, which in tum was a function of the density and
   growth phase of the Nitzschia population. Changes in filtration rate
   with Nitzschia concentration and depuration rate with time can account
   for the DA levels of mussels collected during toxic episodes in Cardigan
   Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada in 1988 and 1989.
   Scallops accumulated DA (0.39-1.3 mug h-1 g-1 more slowly than mussels,
   however, accumulation efficiencies ranged from 5-100\%. Filtration rates
   remained relatively low and constant at 0.08 l h-1. Scallops retained
   domoic acid longer than mussels, a fact which must be considered in the
   marketing of whole scallops for human consumption.},

Abstract = {We investigated the brevetoxin congener PbTx-3 to determine its
   distribution among carrier proteins, including albumin and blood
   lipoproteins. Using a radiolabeled brevetoxin tracer (PbTx-3), we found
   that 39\% of the radiolabel remained associated with components in mouse
   plasma after > 15 kDa cutoff dialysis. Of this portion, only 6.8\% was
   bound to serum albumin. We also examined the binding of brevetoxin to
   various lipoprotein fractions. Plasma, either spiked with PbTx-3 or from
   mice treated for 30 mm with PbTx-3, was fractionated into
   different-sized lipoproteins by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation.
   Each fraction was then characterized and quantified by agarose gel
   electrophoresis and brevetoxin radioimmunoassay, respectively. In both
   the in vitro and in vivo experiments, the majority of brevetoxin
   immunoreactivity was restricted to only those gradient fractions that
   contained high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Independent confirmation of
   brevetoxin binding to HDLs was provided by high molecular weight (100
   kDa cutoff) dialysis of {[}H-3]PbTx-3 from lipoprotein fractions as well
   as a scintillation proximity assay using {[}H-3]PbTx-3 and purified
   human HDLs. This information on the association of brevetoxins with HDLs
   provides a new foundation for understanding the process by which the
   toxin is delivered to and removed from tissues and may permit more
   effective therapeutic measures to treat intoxication from brevetoxins
   and the related ciguatoxins.},

Title = {Domoic acid binds iron and copper:: a possible role for the toxin
   produced by the marine diatom Pseudo-nitzschia},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {127-134},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Toxigenic species of the pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia can produce
   domoic acid (DA), an analog of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate
   and known to cause the human illness amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP).
   Although the trophic transfer of this phycotoxin resulting in mass
   marine bird and mammal mortality has recently been demonstrated, the
   physiological role of domoic acid to the causative organism is still
   unknown. Domoic acid is a small tricarboxylate amino acid whose
   structure resembles that of known iron-complexing agents produced by
   terrestrial plants, such as mugineic acid. This similarity in chemical
   structure of domoic acid to other phytosiderophores suggests a role for
   domoic acid as a trace metal chelator. Using a highly sensitive
   adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetric technique, we investigated
   the iron and copper-binding characteristics of domoic acid revealing it
   does form chelates with both iron and copper and with the following
   conditional stability constants: K-FeDA,Fe(III)'(cond) = 10(8.7 +/- 0.5)
   M-1 and K-CuDA,Cu(II)'(cond) = 10(9.0 +/- 0/2) M-1 (K-FeDA,Fe3+(cond) =
   10(18.7 +/- 0.5) M-1 and K-CuDA, Cu2+(cond) = 10(10.3) +/- M-1). Certain
   Pseudo-nitzschia species may therefore produce domoic acid selectively
   bind trace metals in order to either increase the availability of an
   essential micronutrient, such as in the case of iron, or to decrease the
   availability of a potentially toxic trace metal, such as in the case of
   copper. The strength with which domoic acid binds iron and copper in
   seawater combined with concentrations of dissolved domoic acid
   potentially produced and released during toxic bloom conditions render
   dissolved iron and copper sufficiently bound to domoic acid in seawater
   so as to affect their chemical speciation and thus their biological
   availability. In addition, domoic acid may be particularly important in
   solubilizing particulate iron suspended in these coastal waters where
   Pseudo-nitzschia blooms tend to occur. Thus, possible physiological
   roles for domoic acid with respect to the harmful algal species
   Pseudo-nitzschia may include the acquisition (iron) or detoxification
   (copper) of trace metals in seawater. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins are voltage-gated selective algal toxins responsible for
   ciguatera fish poisoning. In this study we evaluate the toxicokinetics
   of one of the most common ciguatoxins found in the Pacific, the P-CTX-1,
   in rat after an oral or intraperitoneal (ip) dose of 0.26 mu g/kg body
   weight. We report levels of ciguatoxin activity assessed over time in
   blood, urine and feces, and at 4 days in liver, muscle and brain, using
   the functional in vitro N2A cytotoxicity assay. Following exposure, the
   ciguatoxin activity exhibited a rapid systemic absorption that was
   followed by a bi-exponential decline, and data best fit a
   two-compartment model analysis. Maximum blood concentrations were
   reached at 1.97 and 0.43 h after the oral and ip dose, respectively.
   Ciguatoxin elimination from blood was slow with terminal half lives
   (t(1/2)beta) estimated at 82 h for oral and 112 h for ip dosing.
   Ciguatoxin activity remained in liver, muscle and brain 96 h after ip
   and oral administration. While smaller amounts appeared in the urine,
   the main excretion route was feces, with peak rates reaching >10 pg
   P-CTX-1 equivalents/h in both routes of administration. Assay guided
   fractionation showed the presence in the feces and liver of peaks of
   activity corresponding to the P-CTX-1 and to other less polar
   metabolites. In conclusion, biologically active ciguatoxins are
   detectable in blood, liver, muscle and brain, and continued to be
   excreted in urine and feces 4 days following exposure. Blood, as well as
   urine and feces may be useful matrices for low-invasive testing methods
   for ciguatera clinical cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {There are indications that toxic algal blooms are increasing because of
   pollution of coastal waters and worldwide shipping. This mini-review
   deals with the marine biotoxin domoic acid, also known as amnesic
   shellfish poison, and its main producing pennate diatom genus
   Pseudo-nitzschia (Bacillariophyceae). Besides contamination of seafood,
   these organisms have also been involved in human and marine wildlife
   mortality. The article aims to give an overview of all biological and
   environmental factors that should be considered when trying to evaluate
   a possible increase in toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp..
   Pseudo-nitzschia blooms characteristically occur in a low light regime,
   at a time when the temperature is falling and at a wide range of
   salinities. Laboratory studies have shown that the production of domoic
   acid, a water-soluble amino acid, is related to silicon, phosphorus,
   nitrogen and trace metal (mainly iron) availability. Domoic acid has no
   known function in defence or primary metabolism; a role in excretion of
   excess photosynthetic energy or as a binding ligand for trace metals is
   suggested. The variability in domoic acid production by different
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp., or the presence of toxic and non-toxic strains of
   the same species, cannot be explained. The conclusion is drawn that an
   increase in toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. might be possible,
   especially because of the expected increase in nutrient availability
   from pollution and desert dust. Global warming may have an influence as
   well by lengthening the growth period for Pseudo-nitzschia, enlarging
   their global distribution and increasing the dust load through
   desertification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a compound generated as a secondary metabolite
   during harmful algal blooms, has historically received attention as the
   potent neurotoxicity in marine environment. However, the aerobic
   degradation mechanism of DA and the DA-degrader remain largely unknown.
   Here, we revealed the mechanism of aerobic degradation of DA by a
   ubiquitous marine Pseudoalteromonas sp., and more importantly, we
   confirmed that the degradation of DA is mediated by biogenic reactive
   oxygen species (ROS), rather than direct enzymemediated as traditionally
   conceived. Results indicated that DA degradation was caused by biogenic
   O-2(center dot-) and (OH)-O-center dot, where DA underwent reactions of
   decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and oxidation to yield the
   detoxification terminal product. Besides, whole genome sequencing and
   RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the genes conferring to encoding leucine
   dehydrogenase (ldh) and Na+-translocated NADH-quinone oxidoreductase
   (nqrA, nqrF) are responsible for biogenic ROS production. Finally, we
   found through comparative proteomic analysis that biogenic ROS mediated
   the DA degradation may be prevalent in the environment. Overall, this
   work not only reveals aerobic biotransformation mechanism of DA, but
   also identifies a novel mechanism of DA degradation, which provides new
   perspective into the environmental fate of DA and the artificial
   bioremediation of DA.},

Title = {Distribution of Brevetoxin to Lipoproteins in human plasma},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {49},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1010-1018},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {To better understand the distribution of brevetoxins in lipoproteins,
   including their role in tissue delivery and toxin elimination in humans,
   we examined the interaction of brevetoxin congener PbTx-3 with human
   lipoproteins. In a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) and microtiter
   equilibrium dialysis, brevetoxin bound linearly to purified human high
   density, low density, and very low density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and
   VLDL). Both methods demonstrated higher binding capacity per weight for
   HDL over the other lipoproteins; approximately 50\% higher with SPA and
   100\% higher with equilibrium dialysis. The preferential binding of
   brevetoxin to HDL particles is consistent with the higher surface to
   volume ratio of. these particles and the association of the toxin with
   the surface phospholipid/cholesterol domain of the lipoprotein particle.
   Lipoprotein components were next separated from a well-characterized
   human plasma sample to determine the mass distribution of brevetoxin
   within plasma. Equilibrium dialysis of the fractionated and recombined
   lipoproteins and plasma proteins determined that brevetoxin distributed
   predominately (>80\%) to lipoproteins associating with each lipoprotein
   class. These results provide useful information to consider human
   susceptibility differences, such as those based on dyslipidemia, to the
   transport and elimination of polyether toxins. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Application of Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) for field
   detection of the hydrophilic phycotoxins domoic acid and saxitoxin in
   coastal California},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {645-660},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent publications have identified the analysis of phycotoxins in
   sentinel shellfish as a problematic tool for environmental monitoring
   purposes. Domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin produced by some species of the
   diatom Pseudo-nitzschia, can remain undetected in sentinel shellfish
   stocks during toxic blooms and subsequent marine bird and mammal mass
   mortality events. Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) has
   previously been described for monitoring of lipophilic toxins, whereas
   resin-based sampling methods are routinely employed for many other
   environmental contaminants. Here, we evaluate the applicability of SPATT
   for monitoring the hydrophilic phycotoxin DA and demonstrate that the
   same field sampling methods can be used for the detection of saxitoxins.
   We present laboratory-based adsorption profiles characterizing the
   performance of SPATT with four resin types: (1) HP20, (2) SP700, (3)
   SP207, and (4) SP207SS. We present results from 17 mo of approximately
   weekly SPATT deployments in Monterey Bay, California (USA); this period
   included two significant toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events as well
   as low-level saxitoxin events. SPATT signaled the presence of DA 3 and 7
   weeks before the recognition of bloom conditions by traditional
   monitoring techniques (7 and 8 weeks before shellfish toxicity). Under
   ambient (non-bloom) conditions, all resins detected DA when its presence
   was not apparent from traditional monitoring, highlighting the ubiquity
   of low level or transient toxin events in the environment. This study is
   the first to evaluate SPATT deployments in U. S. waters, and the first
   to demonstrate the applicability of SPATT toward detection of
   hydrophilic phycotoxins in the field.},

Title = {Measurement of brevetoxin levels by radioimmunoassay of blood collection

Abstract = {We developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) using a sheep anti-brevetoxin
   antiserum to evaluate detection of brevetoxin on blood collection cards
   from mice treated with the brevetoxin congener PbTx-3. The RIA has high
   affinity for PbTx-3 {[}half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) SE =
   1.2 +/- 0.2 nM; n = 10] and recognizes both type I and type 2
   brevetoxins, but not ciguatoxin. Direct comparison of the RIA with a
   radiolabeled {[}H-3]-PbTx-3 receptor-binding assay (RBA) revealed
   excellent sensitivity, congener selectivity, and minimal interference
   from blood matrix. We first analyzed blood samples from an acute time
   course exposure, using a maximal nonlethal dose {[}180 mug/kg body
   weight (bw)] for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hr. Mean blood brevetoxin levels
   were 36 nM at 30 min and stayed above 20 nM during the 1-4 hr time
   points. We next analyzed blood brevetoxin levels after longer exposure
   (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7 days). Mean blood brevetoxin levels were 26.0 nM
   at 0.5 days, decreased to 8.2 nM at 1.0 day, and maintained a
   significant level (p < 0.05) of 1.3 nM at day 2. We next determined the
   lowest measurable dose using increasing concentrations of PbTx-3 (10-300
   mug/kg bw). Analysis of the blood samples at 60 min revealed a linear
   relationship between administered and internal doses (r(2) = 0.993). AN
   doses of brevetoxin administered were detectable at 1 hr, with
   significant levels found for the lowest administered dose of 10 mug/kg
   bw-a dose that was 10-fold lower than the lowest observable effect
   level. This RIA provides an optimal first-tier detection of brevetoxin
   from blood collection cards and, used in combination with the RBA and
   liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, should provide a complete panel
   of methods to biomonitor brevetoxin exposure.},

Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {205},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) can pose a serious threat to human
   health. Among them, saxitoxin (STX) is one of the most potent natural
   neurotoxins. Here, the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, was exposed to
   environmentally relevant concentrations (2.5 and 25 mu g/L) STX for 48
   h. Although no lethal effects were observed at both concentrations, the
   transcriptome was significantly altered, and displayed a
   concentration-dependent response. STX exposure decreased the copepod's
   metabolism and compromised immune defense and detoxification.
   Additionally, STX disturbed signal transduction, which might affect
   other cellular processes. STX exposure could inhibit the copepod's
   chitin metabolism, disrupting its molting process. Also, the processes
   related to damage repair and protection were up-regulated to fight
   against high concentration exposure. Collectively, this study has
   provided an early warning of PSTs for coastal ecosystem not only because
   of their potent toxicity effect but also their bioaccumulation that can
   transfer up the food chain after ingestion by copepods.},

Title = {The copepod Calanus finmarchicus: A potential vector for trophic

Abstract = {The marine algal biotoxin, domoic acid (DA), is produced by certain
   members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. This neurotoxin has been
   responsible for several mass mortality events involving marine birds and
   mammals. In all cases, the toxin was transferred from its algal
   producers through marine food webs by one or more intermediate vectors.
   The ability of some copepod taxa to serve as vectors for DA has been
   demonstrated; however, the role played in DA trophic transfer by Calanus
   finmarchicus. which often dominates N. Atlantic zooplankton assemblages
   and is a primary dietary component of the highly endangered N. Atlantic
   right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), has been uncertain. In the present
   study, we examined the ability of C. finmarchicus to consume
   DA-producing algae and retain the toxin. Results of grazing and toxin
   accumulation/depuration experiments showed that C. finmarchicus consumed
   DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries regardless of the presence or
   absence of morphologically similar, but non-toxic, P. pungens, across
   initial cell concentrations ranging from 1000-4000 cells mL(-1).
   Furthermore, C. finmarchicus did not appear to preferentially consume or
   avoid either Pseudo-nitzschia species tested. After ingestion of P.
   multiseries, copepods accumulated DA and retained it for up to 48 h
   post-removal of the toxin source. These findings provide evidence for
   the potential of C. finmarchicus to facilitate DA trophic transfer in
   marine food webs where toxic Pseudo-nitzschia is present. Published by

Abstract = {Three Calanus species, Calanus glacialis, Calanus finmarchicus and
   Calanus hyperboreus, which are the most important zooplankton herbivores
   in Western Greenland, were fed with unialgal cultures of toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia seriata and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima.
   All three copepod species grazed on toxic P. seriata and also
   accumulated domoic acid during the grazing. There were no differences in
   ingestion rates between toxic and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species in
   any of the copepods. C. finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus grazed on toxic
   P. seriata during the first 6 h of the experiment but seemed to stop
   grazing during the last 6 h of the experiment suggesting that the
   copepods may have suffered some kind of physiological incapacitation due
   to ingestion of domoic acid. C. glacialis grazed on toxic P. serious
   continuously during the whole experiment, probably due to the lower
   domoic acid cell quota of P. seriata during the experiment on C.
   glacialis than on the other two copepod species. The depuration
   experiment on C. glacialis indicated that the copepods still retained
   domoic acid after 10 h of depuration in filtered sea water. The results
   show that the three Calanus species are potential vectors for domoic
   acid to higher trophic levels in the Arctic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {53-59},

Abstract = {Fish are frequently exposed to harmful algal blooms (HAB) and to related
   toxins. However, the biological effects of okadaic acid (OA), the most
   abundant and frequent HAB-toxin in Europe, South America and Asia, have
   been poorly investigated. In this study, fish swimming performance and
   metabolic rates were investigated in juveniles of Zebra seabream
   (Diplodus cervinus) exposed to OA-group toxins via dietary route, during
   three days. Fish fed on contaminated food accumulated up to 455.5 mu g
   OA equiv. Kg(-1). Significant lower mean critical swimming speed (Ucrit)
   were observed in fish orally exposed to OA (and its related isomer
   dinophysistoxin-1, DTX-1) than fish feeding on non-toxic diet. A
   tendency to higher demands of oxygen consumption was also recorded in
   OA-exposed fish at higher current velocities. This study indicates that
   fish may not be affected by OA-group toxins under basal conditions, but
   suggests a decrease in fitness linked to a reduction in swimming
   performance of fish exposed to OA under increased stimulus. OA and
   related toxins are suggested to have a cryptic effect on swimming
   performance that may be enhanced when fish deals with multiple
   stressors. Considering that a reduction in swimming performance may have
   impact on critical activities, such as foraging and escaping from
   predators, this study highlights the ecological risk associated with
   dinoflagellate toxic blooms, biotoxins food web transfer and fish
   contamination.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {421},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a major marine neurotoxin, occurs frequently in most
   of the world's coastlines and seriously threatens ecosystem and public
   health. However, information on its biotransformation process in coastal
   anaerobic environments remains unclear. In this study, the underlying
   mechanism of anaerobic biotransformation of DA by marine consortium GLY
   was investigated using the combination of liquid
   chromatography-highresolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and comparative
   metatranscriptomics analysis. The results demonstrated that DA could be
   cometabolically biotransformed under anaerobic conditions with
   pseudo-first-order reaction. Anaerobic biotransformation pathway of DA
   was clarified, including decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, carboxylation
   activation with CoA and multiple 13-oxidation steps occurring at
   aliphatic side chain, which facilitated DA detoxification. Furthermore,
   anaerobic cometabolic biotransformation mechanism of glycine-DA by
   consortium GLY was established for the first time, a number of genes
   related to the metabolic pathways of glycine fermentation, fatty acid
   synthesis and 13-oxidation were responded in the consortium GLY
   transcriptome and involved in the anaerobic biotransformation of DA.
   This study could deepen understanding of interaction mechanism between
   toxin DA and marine microorganisms, which provides a new insight into
   the DA fate and its effects on benthic microbial community in marine
   environments.},

Abstract = {The marine neurotoxins brevetoxin A, brevetoxin B, and ciguatoxin bind
   to the same site (site 5) on the voltage-gated sodium channel. This
   work, and the following paper in this issue, describe efforts to
   identify the common pharmacophore and to develop a ligand-receptor model
   for the binding of these neurotoxins to site 5. Conformational analysis
   of brevetoxin A has been completed using ah internal coordinate Monte
   Carlo search protocol. Within 6 kcal/mol of the global minimum (in
   vacuo), there are 48 conformations of brevetoxin A. In chloroform or
   water solvent, the calculated relative energies change, but no new
   minima appear. Like brevetoxin B, brevetoxin A has both straight and
   bent conformers available. Elimination of several G-ring crown
   conformers from consideration and comparison of the two brevetoxin
   backbones indicates that those that match most closely in overall shape
   and location of functional groups are straight. We postulate that the
   common pharmacophore is a roughly cigar-shaped molecule (similar to 30
   Angstrom long) bound to its receptor primarily by hydrophobic and
   nonpolar solvation forces, possibly aided by strategically
   placed,hydrogen bonds near the site of the lactone carbonyl in the
   receptor.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {A method has been tested in laboratory mice to monitor for the presence
   of brevetoxins in blood after exposure. The use of blood collection
   cards is an adaptation of a method employed for routine diagnostic and
   genetic testing of newborns. Blood is collected and applied to a
   0.5-inch diameter circle on a specially prepared blood collection card
   and allowed to dry. The blood spots are then extracted and the presence
   of toxin activity is first screened using a high throughput receptor
   binding assay. Positive samples are then examined for specific
   brevetoxin congeners by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
   Preliminary experiments tested the efficiency and linearity of toxin
   extraction from blood spiked with brevetoxin-3 (PbTx-3). Blood from
   treated mice was tested for the presence of brevetoxin at different
   times following exposure to a sublethal dose (180 mug/kg PbTx-3).
   Brevetoxin activity determined by receptor assay increased to 25 +/- 7.4
   nM PbTx-3 equivalents within 4 hr after exposure and was still
   detectable in three of four animals 24 hr after exposure. Tandem mass
   spectrometry provided confirmation of PbTx-3, which also increased for
   the time points between 0.5 and 4.0 hr exposure. However, PbTx-3 was not
   detected at 24 hr, which suggested the formation of a biologically,
   active metabolite. We anticipate that this approach will provide a
   method to biomonitor brevetoxins in living marine resources (e.g.,
   finfish), protected species, and humans.},

Abstract = {We examined detoxification of brevetoxin in rats through metabolic
   activities and key elimination routes by analyzing samples from
   individual rats exposed to two brevetoxin congeners (PbTx-2 and PbTx-3).
   Brevetoxins were detected by radioimmunoassay in methanolic extracts of
   blood within 1 h post intraperitoneal (ip) administration. The toxin
   assay response was about three times higher in PbTx-2-treated rats
   versus the same dose (180 mu g/kg) of PbTx-3. This difference persisted
   for up to 8 h postexposure. When the blood samples were reextracted with
   20\% methanol to enhance recovery of potential polar brevetoxin
   metabolites, 25-fold higher assay activity was present in the
   PbTx-2-treated rats. Analysis of urine from the same animals identified
   7-fold more activity in the PbTx-2-treated rats that accumulated over
   the course of 24 h. Radioimmunoassay-guided high performance liquid
   chromatographic analysis of urine from PbTx-2-treated rats yielded three
   major peaks of activity. The first peak was attributed to the two
   cysteine adducts, cysteine-PbTx sulfoxide and cysteine-PbTx (MH+: m/z
   1034 and 1018). The second peak was attributed to the oxidized form of
   PbTx-2 (MH+: m/z 911) and its reduction product PbTx-3. The third peak
   remains unidentified. Brevetoxin cysteine conjugate and its sulfoxide
   product contributed nearly three-quarters of the brevetoxin
   immunoactivity. Our findings indicate the most commonly occurring PbTx-2
   is rapidly transformed to a polar metabolite of a reduced biological
   activity that appears in blood and remains for up to 8 h, yet is cleared
   mostly to the urine within 24 h.},

Title = {Quantification, extractability and stability of dissolved domoic acid
   within marine dissolved organic matter},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {215},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {The widespread diatom Pseudo-nitzschia can produce domoic acid (DA). DA
   is a compound with well described neurotoxic effects on vertebrates
   including humans known as amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) syndrome. It
   has also been suggested to serve as an organic ligand that binds to iron
   and copper. By binding these trace elements, DA may increase their
   solubility and bioavailability. In order to serve this function, DA has
   to be excreted and reabsorbed by the cells. Only few records of
   dissolved domoic acid (dDA) concentrations in the ocean exist. To
   accomplish quantification by ultra performance liquid chromatography
   (UPLC), samples have to be pre-concentrated and desalted using
   solid-phase extraction, a procedure commonly applied for dissolved
   organic matter. Our major goals were to quantify dDA in a basin-wide
   assessment in the East Atlantic Ocean, to determine extraction
   efficiencies for complexed and uncomplexed dDA, and to assess whether
   domoic acid is represented by its molecular formula in direct-infusion
   high resolution mass spectrometry. Our results showed that dDA was
   extracted almost quantitatively and occurred ubiquitously in the ocean
   surface but also in deeper (and older) water, indicating surprisingly
   high stability in seawater. The maximum concentration measured was 173
   pmol L-1 and the average molar dDA carbon yield was 7.7 ppm. Both carbon
   yield and dDA concentration decreased with increasing water depth.
   Providing quantification of dDA in the water column, we seek to improve
   our understanding of toxic bloom dynamics and the mechanistic
   understanding of DA production.},

Title = {Analysis of the passage of the marine biotoxin okadaic acid through an

Abstract = {The marine biotoxin okadaic acid (OA), produced by dinoflagellates, can
   accumulate in various bivalve molluscs. In humans, oral consumption of
   shellfish contaminated with OA induces acute toxic effects like
   diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. However, tumorigenic and
   embryotoxic effects of OA have been also described. Current
   toxicokinetic studies with mice were performed with high cytotoxic oral
   doses leading presumably to a paracellular passage of OA through the
   gastrointestinal barrier. There are no studies available analyzing the
   absorption at low concentrations, which represent a realistic dietary
   exposure, making a reliable risk assessment difficult. Therefore, we
   performed a low-dose study using the human intestinal Caco-2 cell model
   to simulate the intestinal barrier. Low level exposure of 20-200 nM OA
   to the cell monolayer allows an only limited passage from the
   ``luminal{''} to the ``blood side{''}. Furthermore, we could detect a
   significant efflux of OA, which led to the suggestion that active
   transport mechanisms are involved in the elimination process of OA.
   In conclusion, our results indicate that besides the well known defense
   mechanisms of humans against this marine biotoxin - vomiting and
   diarrhea - further detoxification mechanisms are available to limit the
   absorption of toxic OA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Azadinium spinosum (Elbrachter and Tillmann), a small marine
   dinoflagellate, has been recently described as a de novo producer of
   azaspiracid-1 and -2 (AZA1 and -2) diarrhoeic toxins. A culture of A.
   spinosum was established in our laboratory and optimised for pilot-scale
   production of this organism, to evaluate and understand AZA1 and -2
   accumulation and biotransformation in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) fed
   with A. spinosum.
   Adult mussels were continuously exposed to A. spinosum over 1 week in
   160 L cylindrical conical tanks. Three different diets were tested for
   contamination: 5000, 10 000 cells mL(-1) of A. spinosum and a mixture of
   5000 cells mL(-1) of A. spinosum with 5000 cells mL(-1) of Isochrysis
   aff. galbana (T-Iso, CCAP 927/14). During the subsequent period of
   detoxification (2 weeks), contaminated mussels were continuously fed
   with 5000 cells mL(-1) of T-Iso. Kinetics of accumulation,
   detoxification and biotransformation were evaluated, as well as the
   toxin distribution and the effect of A. spinosum on mussel digestive
   gland tubules.
   M. edulis fed on A. spinosum in the three tested conditions; this
   finding confirmed our recent experiments feeding A. spinosum to mussels.
   The original algal toxins AZA1 and -2, as well as mussel metabolites
   AZA3 to 12, -17, -19, -21 and -23 were found during these trials. After
   as little as 6 h, azaspiracid contents in mussels reached the EU
   regulatory limit, and metabolites were observed in all conditions at
   approximately 25\% of the total AZA content. This fraction exceeded 50\%
   after 24 h, and continued to increase until the end of the study. AZA17
   and -19 were found to be the main metabolites, with AZA17 concentrations
   estimated in the same order of magnitude as that of the main algal
   toxin, AZA1. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Uptake and elimination of brevetoxin in blood of striped mullet

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {113},

Abstract = {There is a critical need to simply and reliably monitor brevetoxins
   routinely in the blood of humans and aquatic animals. We used striped
   mullet as laboratory test animals to better define the uptake and
   elimination kinetics of brevetoxin during an aqueous exposure to the
   brevetoxin-producing dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Striped mullet were
   first exposed to sublethal densities of K brevis (similar to 250,000
   cells/L) for 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr. No mortality was observed in the
   aquaria, and at each time point blood samples were taken and applied to
   blood collection cards for brevetoxin analysis using radioimmunoassay
   (RIA). The RIA indicated that blood levels of brevetoxin (PbTx-3)
   increased to values significantly different from that of the controls at
   all five time points during exposure (p < 0.05). Striped mullet were
   then exposed to a K brevis culture with a known brevetoxin concentration
   of 0.5 ng/mL. Even after exposures at a low brevetoxin concentration,
   RIA was able to detect 2.25 +/- 0.62 ng/mL PbTx-3 equivalents in the
   blood of the mullet at 8 hr of exposure. When exposed to higher
   brevetoxin concentrations (3.5 and 5.4 ng/mL), blood breve-toxin
   increased to peak levels at 12 hr and then reached equilibrium after 24
   hr in the continued presence of K brevis. During this time of
   equilibrium, the mullet maintained brevetoxins with a blood:water
   coefficient of 2.2. To define the elimination of brevetoxin, striped
   mullet were next exposed for 8-10 hr and then transferred to fresh
   seawater containing no K brevis for up to 116 hr. Blood brevetoxin
   levels remained elevated and decreased only by 50\% 116 hr after
   transfer. The rate of elimination fit best to a two-phase exponential
   decay with a biologic half-life of 12 and 266 hr. This study, using RIA
   in conjunction with blood collection cards, demonstrates an effective
   means to monitor blood brevetoxin levels in finfish and provides a
   foundation to characterize biologically relevant levels of brevetoxin in
   other species impacted by red tide events.},

Title = {Origin of Ciguateric Fish: Quantitative Modelling of the Flow of
   Ciguatoxin through a Marine Food Chain},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To begin to understand the impact of food chain dynamics on ciguatera
   risk, we used published data to model the transfer of ciguatoxins across
   four trophic levels of a marine food chain in Platypus Bay, Australia.
   The data to support this first attempt to conceptualize the scale of
   each trophic transfer step was limited, resulting in broad estimates.
   The hypothetical scenario we explored generated a low-toxicity 10 kg
   Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) with a flesh concentration of
   0.1 mu g/kg of Pacific-ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1, also known as CTX1B) from
   19.5-78.1 mu g of P-CTX-1 equivalents (eq.) that enter the marine food
   chain from a population of 12-49 million benthic dinoflagellates
   (Gambierdiscus sp.) producing 1.6 x 10(-12) g/cell of the P-CTX-1
   precursor, P-CTX-4B. This number of Gambierdiscus could be epiphytic on
   22-88 kg of the benthic macroalgae (Cladophora) that carpets the bottom
   of much of Platypus Bay, with the toxin transferred to an estimated
   40,000-160,000 alpheid shrimps in the second trophic level. This large
   number of shrimps appears unrealistic, but toxic shrimps would likely be
   consumed by a school of small, blotched javelin fish (Pomadasys
   maculatus) at the third trophic level, reducing the number of shrimps
   consumed by each fish. The Spanish mackerel would accumulate a flesh
   concentration of 0.1 mu g/kg P-CTX-1 eq. by preying upon the school of
   blotched javelin and consuming 3.6-14.4 mu g of P-CTX-1 eq. However,
   published data indicate this burden of toxin could be accumulated by a
   10 kg Spanish mackerel from as few as one to three blotched javelin
   fish, suggesting that much greater amounts of toxin than modelled here
   must at certain times be produced and transferred through Platypus Bay
   food chains. This modelling highlights the need for better quantitative
   estimates of ciguatoxin production, biotransformation, and depuration
   through marine food chains to improve our understanding and management
   of ciguatera risk.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxic amino acid produced by several marine
   algal species of the Pseudo-nitzschia (PN) genus. We studied the
   elimination of DA from hemolymph after intravascular (IV) injection in
   razor clams (Siliqua patula), mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Dungeness
   crabs (Cancer magister). Crabs were also injected with two other organic
   acids, dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) and kainic acid (KA). For IV dosing,
   hemolymph was repetitively sampled and DA concentrations measured by
   HPLC-UV. Toxicokinetic analysis of DA in crabs suggested most of the
   injected dose remained within hemolymph compartment with little
   extravascular distribution. This observation is in sharp contrast to
   results obtained from clams and mussels which exhibited similarly large
   apparent volumes of distribution despite large differences in overall
   clearance. These findings suggest fundamentally different storage and
   elimination processes are occurring for DA between bivalves and crabs.

Abstract = {Marine toxins are currently monitored by means of a bioassay that
   requires the use of many mice, which poses a technical and ethical
   problem in many countries. With the exception of domoic acid, there is a
   legal requirement for the presence of other toxins (yessotoxin,
   saxitoxin and analogs, okadaic acid and analogs, pectenotoxins and
   azaspiracids) in seafood to be controlled by bioassay, but other toxins,
   such as palytoxin, cyclic imines, ciguatera and tetrodotoxin are
   potentially present in European food and there are no legal requirements
   or technical approaches available to identify their presence. The need
   for alternative methods to the bioassay is clearly important, and
   biosensors have become in recent years a feasible alternative to animal
   sacrifice. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of
   using biosensors as alternatives to animal assays for marine toxins,
   with particular focus on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology.},

Abstract = {Human poisoning by azaspiracids (AZAs) has emerged as an increasing
   problem in Europe in recent years. Azaspiracid-2 (AZA-2) is one of the
   most abundant azaspiracids in nature. Although AZA-2 was recently
   involved in several toxic episodes leading to human intoxications, there
   is no information available about its mechanism of action or its
   cytotoxic effect in cellular models. This paper reports on the
   neurotoxic effect of azaspiracid-2 and its potential cellular targets.
   We explore the cellular and cytotoxic effects of AZA-2 and AZA-2-methyl
   ester (where the carboxylic acid moiety of AZA-2 was converted to the
   corresponding methyl ester) in cerebellar neurons. Pharmacological tools
   were used to analyze the role of different signal transduction pathways
   in the toxicity of AZA-2. The neurotoxicity of AZA-2 and AZA-2-methyl
   ester was developmentally regulated, exhibiting a higher cytotoxicity in
   younger cells (2-3 div). After excluding several signal transduction
   pathways, we found that inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein
   kinase JNK completely prevented the cytotoxic effect of AZA-2 in
   neurons. Furthermore, neuronal exposure to AZA-2 or AZA-2-methyl ester
   caused an increase in the amount of total and phosphorylated JNK and
   produced nuclear accumulation of the protein. The results presented here
   point to a common target for AZA-1 and AZA-2 and constitute the first
   experimental approach to investigate the cytotoxicity of AZA-2 in vitro,
   establishing an initial approach to probe the mechanism of action of
   these group of natural toxins. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {It is still limited that how the microalgal toxin okadaic acid (OA)
   affects the intestinal microbiota in marine fishes. In the present
   study, adult marine medaka Oryzias melastigma was exposed to the
   environmentally relevant concentration of OA (5 mu g/L) for 10 days, and
   then recovered in fresh seawater for 10-days depuration. Analysis of
   taxonomic composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota, as
   well as function prediction analysis and histology observation were
   carried out in this study. Functional prediction analysis indicated that
   OA potentially affected the development of colorectal cancer, protein
   and carbohydrate digestion and absorption functions, and development of
   neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, which may be
   associated with changes in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in marine
   medaka. Significant increases of C-reactive protein (CRP) and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, as well as the changes of histology
   of intestinal tissue demonstrated that an intestinal inflammation was
   induced by OA exposure in marine medaka. This study showed that the
   environmental concentrations of OA could harm to the intestinal
   microbiota thus threatening the health of marine medaka, which hints
   that the chemical ecology of microalgal toxins should be paid attention
   to in future studies.},

Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-65},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Brevetoxins are potent marine toxins produced by the dinoflagellate
   Karenia brevis, the causative organism of Florida red tides. An in vitro
   metabolism of PbTx-2 was performed using purified cDNA-expressed rat
   liver cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes and freshly isolated rat
   hepatocytes. The metabolic activities of six CYP enzymes, CYP1A2,
   CYP2A2, CYP2C11, CYP2D1, CYP2E1, and CYP3A1, were examined by incubation
   with PbTx-2 for up to 4 h in the presence of a NADPH-generating system.
   Further identification of the metabolites produced by CYP1A2 and CYP3A1
   was preformed using high performance liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS). Both CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 metabolized PbTx-2 to
   PbTx-3 (MH+: m/z 897), PbTx-9 (MH+: m/z 899), and a newly recorded diol
   brevetoxin-2 metabolite (MH+: m/z 929). CYP3A1 also produced a
   considerably higher amount of BTX-B5 (MH+: m/z 911). Subsequent
   incubation of PbTx-2 with rat hepatocytes produced additional phase 1
   metabolites of MH+: m/z 911, 913, 915, 917, and 931, indicating a
   CYP-catalyzed epoxidation at H-ring (C-27,C-28-double bond) and a
   subsequent A-ring hydrolysis of PbTx-2 metabolic products. A conjugation
   metabolism was identified by the production of a glutathione-brevetoxin
   conjugate (MH+: m/z 1222) and a cysteine-brevetoxin conjugate (MH+: m/z
   1018). Structures of the new metabolites are postulated, and a likely
   CYP-catalyzed metabolism pathway of PbTx-2 metabolism are discussed.},

Title = {First subcellular localization of the amnesic shellfish toxin, domoic
   acid, in bivalve tissues: Deciphering the physiological mechanisms
   involved in its long-retention in the king scallop Pecten maximus},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), the phycotoxin responsible for amnesic shellfish
   poisoning (ASP), is an excitatory amino acid naturally produced by at
   least twenty-eight species of the bloom-forming marine diatoms
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Suspension feeders, such as bivalve mollusks, can
   accumulate and lengthy retain high amounts of DA in their tissues,
   threatening human health and leading to extensive-prolonged fishery
   closures, and severe economic losses. This is particularly problematic
   for the king scallop Pecten maximus, which retains high burdens of DA
   from months to years compared to other fast-depurator bivalves.
   Nonetheless, the physiological and cellular processes responsible for
   this retention are still unknown. In this work, for the first time, a
   novel immunohistochemical techniques based on the use of an anti-DA
   antibody was successfully developed and applied for DAdetection in
   bivalve tissues at a subcellular level. Our results show that in
   naturally contaminated P. maximus following a Pseudo-nitzschia australis
   outbreak, DA is visualized mainly within small membrane-bounded vesicles
   (1 - 2.5 mu m) within the digestive gland cells, identified as
   autophagosomic structures by means of immuneelectron microscopy, as well
   as in the mucus-producing cells, particularly those from gonad ducts and
   digestive tract. Trapping of DA in autophagososomes may be a key
   mechanism in the long retention of DA in scallops. These results and the
   development of DA-immunodetection are essential to provide a better
   understanding of the fate of DA, and further characterize DA
   contamination-decontamination kinetics in marine bivalves, as well as
   the main mechanisms involved in the long retention of this toxin in P.

Abstract = {Marine and freshwater toxins contaminate water resources, shellfish and
   aquaculture products, causing a broad range of toxic effects in humans
   and animals. Different core-shell nanoparticles were tested as a new
   sorbent for removing marine and freshwater toxins from liquid media.
   Water solutions were contaminated with 20 mg/L of marine toxins and up
   to 50 mg/L of freshwater toxins and subsequently treated with 250 or 125
   mg/L of nanoparticles. Under these conditions, carbon nanoparticles
   removed around 70\% of saxitoxins, spirolides, and azaspiracids, and up
   to 38\% of diarrheic shellfish poisoning toxins. In the case of
   freshwater toxins, the 85\% of microcystin LR was eliminated; other
   cyclic peptide toxins were also removed in a high percentage. Marine
   toxins were adsorbed in the first 5 min of contact, while for freshwater
   toxins it was necessary 60 min to reach the maximum adsorption. Toxins
   were recovered by extraction from nanoparticles with different solvents.
   Gymnodinium catenatum, Prorocentrum lima, and Microcystis aeruginosa
   cultures were employed to test the ability of nanoparticles to adsorb
   toxins in a real environment, and the same efficacy to remove toxins was
   observed in these conditions. These results suggest the possibility of
   using the nanotechnology in the treatment of contaminated water or in
   chemical analysis applications. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {An investigation into ciguatoxin bioaccumulation in sharks},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {234-243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTXs) produced by benthic Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates,
   readily biotransform and bioaccumulate in food chains ultimately
   bioconcentrating in high-order, carnivorous marine species. Certain
   shark species, often feeding at, or near the top of the food-chain have
   the ability to bioaccumulate a suite of toxins, from both anthropogenic
   and algal sources. As such, these apex predators are likely sinks for
   CTXs. This assumption, in conjunction with anecdotal knowledge of
   poisoning incidents, several nonspecific feeding trials whereby various
   terrestrial animals were fed suspect fish flesh, and a single incident
   in Madagascar in 1994, have resulted in the widespread acceptance that
   sharks may accumulate CTXs. This prompted a study to investigate
   original claims within the literature, as well as investigate CTX
   bioaccumulation in the muscle and liver of 22 individual sharks from
   nine species, across four locations along the east coast of Australia.
   Utilizing an updated ciguatoxin extraction method with HPLC-MS/MS, we
   were unable to detect P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 or P-CTX-3, the three primary CTX
   congeners, in muscle or liver samples. We propose four theories to
   address this finding: (1) to date, methods have been optimized for
   teleost species and may not be appropriate for elasmobranchs, or the
   CI-Xs may be below the limit of detection; (2) CTX may be biotransformed
   into elasmobranch-specific congeners as a result of unique metabolic
   properties; (3) 22 individuals may be an inadequate sample size given
   the rare occurrence of high-order ciguatoxic organisms and potential for
   CTX depuration; and (4) the ephemeral nature and inconsistent toxin
   profiles of Gambierdiscus blooms may have undermined our classifications
   of certain areas as CTX hotspots. These results, in combination with the
   lack of clarity within the literature, suggest that ciguatoxin
   bioaccumulation in sharks remains elusive, and warrants further
   investigation to determine the dynamics of toxin production,
   accumulation and transformation throughout the entire food-web. (C) 2016

Title = {Brevetoxin in two planktivorous fishes after exposure to Karenia
   brevis:: implications for food-web transfer to bottlenose dolphins},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {356},
Pages = {251-258},
Abstract = {Brevetoxin uptake was analyzed in 2 common planktivorous fish that are
   likely food-web vectors for dolphin mortality events associated with
   brevetoxin-producing red tides. Fish were exposed to
   brevetoxin-producing Karenia brevis for 10 h under conditions previously
   reported to produce optimal uptake of toxin in blood after oral
   exposure. Striped mullet Mugil cephalus were exposed to a low dose of
   brevetoxin, and uptake and depuration by specific organs were evaluated
   over a 2 mo period. Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus specimens were
   used to characterize a higher brevetoxin dose uptake into whole body
   components and evaluate depuration over I mo. We found a high uptake of
   toxin by menhaden, with a body to water ratio of 57 after a 10 h
   exposure and a slow elimination with a half life (t(1/2)) of 24 d.
   Elimination occurred rapidly from the intestine (t(1/2) < 1 wk) and
   muscle (t(1/2) = 1 wk) compartments and redistributed to liver which
   continued to accumulate body stores of toxin for 4 wk. The accumulation
   and elimination characteristics of the vectoring capacity of these 2
   fish species are interpreted in relation to data from the Florida
   Panhandle dolphin mortality event of 2004. We show that due to slow
   elimination rate of brevetoxin in planktivorous fish, brevetoxin-related
   dolphin mortality events may occur without evidence of a concurrent
   harmful algal bloom event.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution of
   brevetoxin-3 administered to pregnant dams and to determine the extent
   of placental transport to fetuses. Twenty-nine pregnant CD-1 mice were
   administered H-3-brevetoxin-3 (similar to 1.3 mu Ci/animal; similar to
   2.8 mu g compound/kg) by intratracheal instillation on one of
   gestational days 15-18. Groups of four or five dams were killed at
   selected times through 48 h post-dosing. Four pregnant dams were
   administered H-3-brevetoxin-3 on gestational day 15 or 16 via osmotic
   minipump to provide continuous delivery of compound (similar to 0.13 mu
   Ci, 7.5ng compound/day) over a 72-h period. Then the dams and fetuses
   were killed. Brevetoxin-associated radioactivity was detected in
   placentas and fetuses within 0.5 h of intratracheal administration.
   Concentrations of brevetoxin equivalents in fetuses were approximately
   0.3 ng/g throughout the 48-h post-dosing, resulting in a calculated dose
   to fetuses of 19 ng/g h. Following brevetoxin infusion, concentration of
   brevetoxin equivalents in fetuses was 0.1 ng/g, lower than that present
   in most maternal tissues. Results demonstrated placental transport of
   brevetoxin or its metabolites following maternal acute exposure and
   repeated low-dose exposure. The consequences of these findings for
   pregnant women exposed to brevetoxins by inhalation or ingestion remain
   to be determined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Neurotoxic Alkaloids: Saxitoxin and Its Analogs},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2185-2211},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Saxitoxin (STX) and its 57 analogs are a broad group of natural
   neurotoxic alkaloids, commonly known as the paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs). PSTs are the causative agents of paralytic shellfish poisoning
   (PSP) and are mostly associated with marine dinoflagellates (eukaryotes)
   and freshwater cyanobacteria (prokaryotes), which form extensive blooms
   around the world. PST producing dinoflagellates belong to the genera
   Alexandrium, Gymnodinium and Pyrodinium whilst production has been
   identified in several cyanobacterial genera including Anabaena,
   Cylindrospermopsis, Aphanizomenon Planktothrix and Lyngbya. STX and its
   analogs can be structurally classified into several classes such as
   non-sulfated, mono-sulfated, di-sulfated, decarbamoylated and the
   recently discovered hydrophobic analogs-each with varying levels of
   toxicity. Biotransformation of the PSTs into other PST analogs has been
   identified within marine invertebrates, humans and bacteria. An improved
   understanding of PST transformation into less toxic analogs and
   degradation, both chemically or enzymatically, will be important for the
   development of methods for the detoxification of contaminated water
   supplies and of shellfish destined for consumption. Some PSTs also have
   demonstrated pharmaceutical potential as a long-term anesthetic in the
   treatment of anal fissures and for chronic tension-type headache. The
   recent elucidation of the saxitoxin biosynthetic gene cluster in
   cyanobacteria and the identification of new PST analogs will present
   opportunities to further explore the pharmaceutical potential of these
   intriguing alkaloids.},

   species},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the deleterious effects of the phycotoxin domoic acid (DA) on
   human health, and the permanent threat of blooms of the toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia sp. over commercially important fishery-resources,
   knowledge regarding the physiological mechanisms behind the profound
   differences in accumulation and depuration of this toxin in contaminated
   invertebrates remain very scarce. In this work, a comparative analysis
   of accumulation, isomer content, and subcellular localization of DA in
   different invertebrate species was performed. Samples of scallops Pecten
   maximus and Aequipecten opercularis, clams Donax trunculus,
   slippersnails Crepidula fornicata, and seas-quirts Asterocarpa sp. were
   collected after blooms of the same concentration of toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia australis. Differences (P < 0.05) in DA accumulation
   were found, wherein P. maximus showed up to 20-fold more DA in the
   digestive gland than the other species. Similar profiles of DA isomers
   were found between P. maximus and A. opercularis, whereas C. fornicata
   was the species with the highest biotransformation rate (-10 \%) and D.
   trunculus the lowest (-4 \%). DA localization by immunohistochemical
   analysis revealed differences (P < 0.05) between species: in P. maximus,
   DA was detected mainly within autophagosome-like vesicles in the
   cytoplasm of digestive cells, while in A. opercularis and C. fornicata
   significant DA immunoreactivity was found in post-autophagy residual
   bodies. A slight DA staining was found free within the cytoplasm of the
   digestive cells of D. trunculus and Asterocarpa sp. The Principal
   Component Analysis revealed similarities between pectinids, and a clear
   distinction of the rest of the species based on their capabilities to
   accumulate, biotransform, and distribute the toxin within their tissues.
   These findings contribute to improve the understanding of the
   inter-specific dif-ferences concerning the contamination-decontamination
   kinetics and the fate of DA in invertebrate species.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxins are potent neurotoxins produced by the marine dinoflagellate
   Karenia brevis. Exposure to brevetoxins may occur during a K brevis red
   tide when the compounds become aerosolized by wind and surf. This study
   assessed possible adverse health effects associated with inhalation
   exposure to brevetoxin 3, one of the major brevetoxins produced by K
   brevis and present in aerosols collected along beaches affected by red
   tide. Male F344 rats were exposed to brevetoxin 3 at 0, 37, and 237 μ
   g/m(3) by nose-only inhalation 2 hr/day, 5 days/week for up to 22
   exposure days. Estimated deposited brevetoxin 3 doses were 0.9 and 5.8 μ
   g/kg/day for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Body weights
   of the high-dose group were significantly below control values. There
   were no clinical signs of toxicity. Terminal body weights of both low-
   and high-dose-group rats were significantly below control values.
   Minimal alveolar macrophage hyperplasia was observed in three of six and
   six of six of the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. No
   histopathologic lesions were observed in the nose, brain, liver, or bone
   marrow of any group. Reticulocyte numbers in whole blood were
   significantly increased in the high-dose group, and mean corpuscular
   volume showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing exposure
   concentration. Humoral-mediated immunity was suppressed in
   brevetoxin-exposed rats as indicated by significant reduction in splenic
   plaque-forming cells in both low- and high-dose-group rats compared with
   controls. Results indicate that the immune system is the primary target
   for toxicity in rats after repeated inhalation exposure to relatively
   high concentrations of brevetoxins.},

Title = {Laboratory desalination experiments with some algal toxins},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {293},
Pages = {1-6},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Over the last several decades, countries throughout the world have
   experienced an escalating and worrisome trend in the incidence of
   harmful algal blooms (HABs). A concern is that highly potent algal
   toxins might be retained in the treated water, posing a threat to human
   health. Seawater contaminated with saxitoxins, domoic acid, okadaic
   acid, and brevetoxins was desalinated using small (<100 mL capacity)
   reverse osmosis and distillation equipment. Analyses of desalinated
   water samples indicated efficient removal of the four toxins to greater
   than 99\%, except brevetoxins for which some carry-over was observed
   during distillation. Hypochlorite concentrations of 4 ppm or higher were
   sufficient to react with all of the saxitoxins, domoic acid and okadaic
   acid in the samples that contained initial toxin concentrations up to
   1250 ng mL(-1). Brevetoxins appeared to be unaffected in experiments in
   which the toxins were exposed to up to 30 ppm hypochlorite in seawater
   at 35 degrees C for 60 min. These results and their implications in
   terms of desalination plant design and operation are discussed. (c) 2012

Abstract = {The production of toxic secondary metabolites by marine phytoplankton
   and their accumulation in molluscs and fish has ecosystem-wide and human
   health impacts. The potent neurotoxin saxitoxin and its analogs, which
   can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, are produced by species of the
   dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium. These toxins can accumulate in
   filter-feeding molluscs, including commercially grown species of
   shellfish. A feeding experiment was designed to assess the use of
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect a gene involved in
   saxitoxin biosynthesis (sxtA) in two commercial oyster stocks. Both
   diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas were fed with toxic cultures of
   Alexandrium minutum over a period of 12 days to allow toxin
   accumulation. A barcoding gene specific to Alexandrium (ITS 5.8s rRNA)
   and the sxtA gene, domain 4, which is specific to the saxitoxin
   synthesis pathway, were assayed. Both targets were detected in oysters
   collected after 6 and 12 days feeding with A. minutum, and after 24 h of
   depuration during which the oysters were fed nontoxic microalgae only.
   The target genes were not detected in control oysters. These methods can
   be used as a relatively rapid and inexpensive screen that is indicative
   of the presence of saxitoxin-producing microalgae in shellfish.},

Title = {Active elimination of the marine biotoxin okadaic acid by P-glycoprotein

Abstract = {The consumption of okadaic acid (OA) contaminated shellfish can induce
   acute toxic symptoms in humans such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and
   abdominal pain; carcinogenic and embryotoxic effects have also been
   described. Toxicokinetic studies with mice have shown that high
   cytotoxic doses of OA can pass the gastrointestinal barrier presumably
   by paracellular passage. However, in vitro studies using human
   intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers to represent the intestinal barrier
   have shown that at low-dose exposure OA is transported against a
   concentration gradient suggesting an active efflux mechanism. Since
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports a wide variety of substrates, we
   investigated its possible influence on the observed elimination of OA.
   We used two different cellular transwell models: (i) Caco-2 cell
   monolayer endogenously expressing human P-gp and simulating the
   intestinal barrier and (ii) MDCK-II cell monolayer stably
   over-expressing P-gp. Our study demonstrates clearly that OA at
   non-cytotoxic concentrations passes the monolayer barrier only to a low
   degree, and that it is actively eliminated by P-gp over the apical
   membrane. Therefore, our in vitro data indicate that humans appear to
   have efficient defense mechanisms to protect themselves against low-dose
   contaminated shellfish by exhibiting a low bioavailability as a result
   of active elimination of OA by P-gp. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   Development of Aquatic Organisms},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-79},

Abstract = {Marine organisms, and specially phytoplankton species, are able to
   produce a diverse array of toxic compounds that are not yet fully
   understood in terms of their main targets and biological function.
   Toxins such as saxitoxins, tetrodotoxin, palytoxin, nodularin, okadaic
   acid, domoic acid, may be produced in large amounts by dinoflagellates,
   cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms and accumulate in vectors that
   transfer the toxin along food chains. These may affect top predator
   organisms, including human populations, leading in some cases to death.
   Nevertheless, these toxins may also affect the reproduction of aquatic
   organisms that may be in contact with the toxins, either by decreasing
   the amount or quality of gametes or by affecting embryonic development.
   Adults of some species may be insensitive to toxins but early stages are
   more prone to intoxication because they lack effective enzymatic systems
   to detoxify the toxins and are more exposed to the toxins due to a
   higher metabolic growth rate. In this paper we review the current
   knowledge on the effects of some of the most common marine toxins on the
   reproduction and development of early stages of some organisms.},

Title = {Detection and sub-cellular distribution of the amnesic shellfish toxin,
   domoic acid, in the digestive gland of Octopus vulgaris during
   periods of toxin absence},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {784-789},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms
   that is accumulated in the highest concentrations in filter-feeding
   organisms, such as bivalve molluscs. Although DA is a water-soluble
   molecule that is rapidly cleared from most marine organisms, it appears
   that octopus may consistently contain DA in the digestive gland. To test
   this hypothesis, specimens of Octopus vulgaris were caught for DA
   analysis when Pseudo-nitzschia cells were not observed in seawater and
   DA was not detected in octopus food items, i.e. mussels. DA was
   consistently detected in each octopus specimen (n = 32) analysed and its
   concentrations varied from 1.0 to 26.6 mu g g(-1). DA sub-cellular
   distribution was evaluated in the digestive gland of six specimens in
   order to prove whether DA preferably accumulates in some cell
   compartment. DA was predominantly found (> 90\%) in the soluble fraction
   (cytosol) and to a lesser extent in the insoluble fractions (nucleic,
   mitochondrial, lysosomal, microsomal). This disposition should favour DA
   trophic transfer from prey to predators. The present study contributes
   with relevant data to the growing knowledge on the accumulation of
   marine toxins in cephalopods and on the trophic transfer of DA
   throughout the marine food web.},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA), a potent polyether marine toxin, accumulates in the
   digestive glands of marine mollusks and therefore can severely threaten
   the health of humans after ingestion of contaminated shellfish. In vivo
   and in vitro studies have revealed that exposure of various cells,
   including human embryonic amniotic cells, hepatocytes, neuroblastoma
   cells, to OA induces morphological and functional modifications as well
   as the death of cells. As the number of reports on OA poisoning has
   increased, this toxin has gradually attracted the public's attention,
   and researchers are trying to study it. This review summarizes the
   current literature on the toxicity effects of OA, in addition to its

Title = {Cytotoxic effect of palytoxin on mussel},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {56},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {842-847},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Palytoxin is a large and complex polyhydroxylated molecule with potent
   neurotoxic activity. Dinoflagellates from the Ostreopsis genera were
   demonstrated to be producers of this compound and analogues. Even though
   initially palytoxin appearance was restricted to tropical areas, the
   recent occurrence of Ostreopsis outbreaks in Mediterranean Sea point to
   a worldwide dissemination probably related to climatic change. Those
   dinoflagellates can bioaccumulate in shellfish, especially in
   filter-feeding mollusks and have been involved in damaging effects in
   seafood or human toxic outbreaks. The present study describes palytoxins
   effect on metabolic activity of mantle and hepatopancreas cells from the
   mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. Our results indicate that
   palytoxin is highly cytotoxic to mussel cells; unlike it happens with
   other toxins more common in European coasts such as okadaic acid and
   azaspiracid. These findings have a special significance for the marine
   environment and aquiculture since they are evidence for the ability of
   palytoxin to affect the integrity of bivalve mollusks that are not
   adapted to the presence of this toxin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Marine biotoxins in shellfish - Domoic acid Scientific Opinion of the
   Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain},
Journal = {EFSA JOURNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) and its isomers are marine biotoxins causing amnesic
   shellfish poisoning (ASP) in humans. Symptoms of ASP include
   gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal cramps)
   and/or neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of memory, or other
   serious signs such as seizure or coma) occurring within 24-48 hours
   after consuming contaminated shellfish. DA is a water-soluble cyclic
   amino acid mainly produced by marine red algae of the genus Chondria and
   diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitschia. The first confirmed outbreak of
   ASP occurred in Canada in 1987 and was related to mussels affected by a
   bloom of the Pseudonitzschia f. multiseries. DA isomers have also been
   detected in shellfish in the United States and in a number of European
   countries. Although several isomers of DA (diastereoisomer epi-domoic
   acid (epi-DA) and isodomoic acids (iso-DAs)) have been identified data
   on the occurrence only of DA and epi-DA (expressed as sum DA) have been
   reported.
   The toxicological database for DA is limited, comprising mostly studies
   on the acute toxicity in rodents and Cynomolgus monkeys following
   administration by parenteral routes and with few studies with oral
   administration. Neurotoxicity is the critical toxicological effect
   identified in experimental animals as well as in humans. The toxic
   effects of DA are mediated through its high affinity binding and agonist
   activity on some forms of glutamate receptors particularly in certain
   regions (e. g. hippocampus) of the brain. The few data available
   indicate that Cynomolgus monkeys are more sensitive than rodents.
   Following oral administration DA shows low systemic absorption. Absorbed
   DA is rapidly cleared from the body by renal excretion and impaired
   renal function increases the susceptibility to DA.
   Data on the genotoxicity of DA are inconclusive. No data on the chronic
   effects of DA in animals are available, therefore the Panel on
   Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) could not establish a
   tolerable daily intake (TDI). In view of the acute toxicity of DA the
   CONTAM Panel decided to establish an acute reference dose (ARfD) based
   on the available human data on acute toxicity.
   The few data on exposure to DA associated with adverse effects in humans
   (9 individuals) in ASP outbreaks indicate that severe and irreversible
   effects occurred at about 4 mg/kg bodyweight (b.w.) and the
   lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) for mild signs and symptoms
   was 0.9 mg/kg b.w. Although the acute oral toxicity is not well
   characterised, the CONTAM Panel considered it appropriate to base the
   establishment of the ARfD on this LOAEL.
   Taking into account the steep dose-response relationship, the CONTAM
   Panel decided to apply a factor of 3 for extrapolation from a LOAEL to a
   no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). The CONTAM Panel concluded
   that a factor of 10 should be applied to allow for human variability and
   also for fact that sensitive methods for the detection of neurotoxic
   effects had not been used in the investigation of affected individuals.
   The CONTAM Panel therefore established an ARfD of 30 mu g DA/kg b.w. by
   applying the overall uncertainty factor of 30 to the LOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg
   b.w. Because DA can be converted to epi-DA during storage, the ARfD
   applies to the sum of DA and epi-DA.
   In order to ensure protection against the acute effects of DA, it is
   important to use a large portion size rather than the long-term average
   consumption in the health risk assessment of shellfish consumption.
   Consumption data for shellfish species across the European Union (EU)
   were limited, therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
   requested the Member States to provide information on consumption of
   relevant shellfish species. Based on data provided by five Member
   States, the CONTAM Panel identified 400 g of shellfish meat as a large
   portion size to be used in the acute risk assessment of marine
   biotoxins.
   Consumption of a 400 g portion of shellfish meat containing DA and
   epi-DA at the current EU limit of 20 mg DA/kg shellfish meat would
   result in a dietary exposure of 8 mg DA (equivalent to about 130 mu g
   DA/kg b.w. for a 60 kg adult). This is about four times higher than the
   ARfD of 30 mu g DA/kg b.w. (equivalent to 1.8 mg DA per portion for a 60
   kg adult) and is considered to constitute a potential health risk. Based
   on current consumption and occurrence data there is a chance of about 1
   \% of exceeding the ARfD of 30 mu g DA/kg b.w. when consuming shellfish
   currently available on the European market.
   The CONTAM Panel concluded that in order for a 60 kg adult to avoid
   exceeding the ARfD of 30 mu g DA/kg b.w. a 400 g portion of shellfish
   should not contain more than 1.8 mg DA corresponding to 4.5 mg DA/kg
   shellfish meat. Of the currently available occurrence data for samples
   in compliance with the EU regulatory limit of 20 mg/kg shellfish meat,
   3.5 \% exceed this value of 4.5 mg/kg shellfish meat.
   DA is heat stable and cooking does not destroy the toxin, although
   normal home cooking processes, such as boiling and steaming, could
   reduce the amount of DA in shellfish meat due to partial leaching of the
   toxin into the cooking fluids. In scallops, redistribution of DA from
   the hepatopancreas into the other tissues could occur. For other types
   of shellfish it is unlikely that processing would have a major effect on
   the DA concentration in shellfish meat.
   Several analytical methods are available for the determination of DA and
   its isomers. High performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet
   detection (HPLC-UV) methods are widely used. One HPLC-UV method has been
   validated (AOAC method 991.26) and standardised (CEN method 14176). In
   addition, a method based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   has been validated (AOAC method 2006.02) and is officially allowed to be
   used in the EU for screening purposes. These methods have limits of
   detection that are sufficiently low to adequately detect DA at the
   concentration of 4.5 mg/kg shellfish meat, for which consumption of a
   large portion would not lead to the ARfD being exceeded. The available
   evidence suggests that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS),
   particularly using electrospray ionisation in the tandem mode, can also
   be a valuable tool for rapid and selective determination of DA and its
   isomers in crude extracts. Other chemical methods have been developed
   but they are only rarely used and they have not been validated in
   interlaboratory studies.},

Title = {Photochemical treatment strategies for okadaic acid degradation: Effects
   of salinity, oxidants, and UV sources},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {218},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study evaluates the degradation and detoxification of okadaic acid
   (OA), a marine biotoxin, through UVassisted photochemical processes
   using environmentally relevant OA concentrations. Experiments were
   conducted in distilled water (DW) and artificial seawater (ASW),
   applying two UV sources: UV-LED (lambda(max) = 275 nm) and low-pressure
   mercury lamp (LP-Hg; lambda = 254 nm), combined with hydrogen peroxide
   (HP), sodium peroxydisulfate (PDS), and potassium peroxymonosulfate
   (PMS). Photolysis alone was ineffective, and kinetic rate constants
   (k(obs); min(-1)) followed the trend UV/PMS > UV/PDS > UV/HP for both UV
   sources. While all treatments showed high OA removal (>79 \%) in DW,
   degradation was significantly reduced for HP (72.8 \%-89.9 \%) and PDS
   (67.8 \%-76.6 \%) in ASW. In contrast, UV/PMS efficacy improved in
   saline media, achieving rapid and effective degradation of OA, and
   reaching 99 \% detoxification (PP2A activity) within 15 min. The main
   transformation product, norokadanone (m/z 757.453), formed via
   decarboxylation, showed significantly reduced toxicity compared to OA.
   These results confirm the suitability of sulfate radical-based processes
   (particularly UV/ PMS) for OA mitigation in marine environments. In
   addition, this work highlights the critical role of water matrix
   composition in marine toxin treatment and supports the development of
   scalable, mercury-free strategies for effectively mitigating hazardous
   compounds in coastal environments.},

Abstract = {Modelling the uptake and detoxification kinetics of phycotoxins in
   marine filter-feeding bivalve molluscs is discussed and illustrated by a
   case study involving blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the lower St.
   Lawrence estuary in eastern Canada. A dynamic model was fit to empirical
   data acquired on differential responses of mussels transplanted from
   sites characterized by differing history of exposure to toxigenic blooms
   responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Although it is
   difficult to collect sufficient data to calibrate complicated models, it
   appears that one- and two-compartment models are fully adequate for this
   type of modelling. Measuring phycotoxin levels in shellfish can be a
   useful and cost-effective adjunct to direct monitoring of phytoplankton
   toxicity in the water column, because ongoing filtration by shellfish
   provides an integrated estimate of the toxin to which they are exposed.},

   okadaic acid and tetrodotoxin},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Harmful algal bloom and marine toxins are actual and overgrowing
   problems. Okadaic acid (OA) is the main toxin responsible for diarrheic
   shellfish poisoning in humans, while Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a
   tremendously strong neurotoxin. Given their high toxicity, strategies to
   obtain a mitigation of these toxins are every day more fundamental, in
   the optic of preserve consumer health, and in giving supports to
   shellfisheries in selling their products. In this context, the ability
   of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Paracoccus spp. to reduce OA and TTX
   in vitro was evaluated using HPLC/MS-MS technique. Different mechanisms
   of interaction were observed. Some species of LAB were able to reduce
   significantly the amount of toxin while in viable state
   (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1473 = 30\% OA reduction), but also a
   binding effect of the toxins was observed. Contrarily, Paracoccus spp.
   was able to reduce significantly the amount of toxin while in a
   cell-free extract form, in particular Paracoccus aerius 5038 could
   reduce the presence of TTX of about 24\%. This study provided a sound
   line of evidence for the possible future use of either specific bacteria
   or selected bacterial components to reduce the level of harmful marine
   toxins in aquaculture and food production.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2006},

Abstract = {The susceptibility of shellfish to raphidophyte toxicity is not well
   resolved. This study examined the sublethal cellular responses of
   eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica exposed to 2 raphidophyte blooms
   (Chattonella subsalsa or Fibrocapsa japonica). Also, based on the
   hypothesis that raphidophyte toxicity is related to brevetoxin
   production, we determined the cellular responses of oysters to purified
   brevetoxin (PbTx-3) exposure in a separate experiment. We evaluated 3
   cellular biomarkers, constituting both cellular damage and
   detoxification responses: lysosomal destabilization, lipid peroxidation
   and glutathione concentration. Exposing oysters to water collected from
   both blooms significantly increased lysosomal destabilization rates in
   oyster digestive gland when compared to controls, as did exposure to 1
   and 10 nM PbTx-3. Glutathione and lipid peroxidation levels were not
   significantly affected in any treatment.. The physiological stress
   response (i.e. increased lysosomal destabilization rates) in oysters
   exposed to brevetoxin, C. subsalsa bloom water, or F japonica bloom
   water is consistent with that found in oysters exposed to Heterosigma
   akashiwo (Raphidophyceae) blooms and cultures. The results indicate that
   oysters are susceptible to raphidophyte and brevetoxin toxicity, and are
   not solely a vector for neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The common
   physiological response to raphidophyte and brevetoxin exposure is
   consistent with the hypothesized production of brevetoxin by this group,
   but alternatively may reflect a more general stress response in oysters.},

Title = {Depuration Kinetics and Growth Dilution of Caribbean Ciguatoxin in the
   Omnivore Lagodon rhomboides: Implications for Trophic Transfer and
   Ciguatera Risk},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Modeling ciguatoxin (CTX) trophic transfer in marine food webs has
   significant implications for the management of ciguatera poisoning, a
   circumtropical disease caused by human consumption of CTX-contaminated
   seafood. Current models associated with CP risk rely on modeling
   abundance/presence of CTX-producing epi-benthic dinoflagellates, e.g.,
   Gambierdiscus spp., and are based on studies showing that toxin
   production is site specific and occurs in pulses driven by environmental
   factors. However, food web models are not yet developed and require
   parameterizing the CTX exposure cascade in fish which has been
   traditionally approached through top-down assessment of CTX loads in
   wild-caught fish. The primary goal of this study was to provide critical
   knowledge on the kinetics of C-CTX-1 bioaccumulation and depuration in
   the marine omnivore Lagodon rhomboides. We performed a two-phase, 17
   week CTX feeding trial in L. rhomboides where fish were given either a
   formulated C-CTX-1 (n = 40) or control feed (n = 37) for 20 days, and
   then switched to a non-toxic diet for up to 14 weeks. Fish were randomly
   sampled through time with whole muscle, liver, and other pooled viscera
   dissected for toxin analysis by a sodium channel-dependent MTT-based
   mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) assay. The CTX levels measured in all tissues
   increased with time during the exposure period (days 1 to 20), but a
   decrease in CTX-specific toxicity with depuration time only occurred in
   viscera extracts. By the end of the depuration, muscle, liver, and
   viscera samples had mean toxin concentrations of 189\%, 128\%, and 42\%,
   respectively, compared to fish sampled at the start of the depuration
   phase. However, a one-compartment model analysis of combined tissues
   showed total concentration declined to 56\%, resulting in an approximate
   half-life of 97 d (R-2 = 0.43). Further, applying growth dilution
   correction models to the overall concentration found that growth was a
   major factor reducing C-CTX concentrations, and that the body burden was
   largely unchanged, causing pseudo-elimination and a half-life of 143-148
   days (R-2 = 0.36). These data have important implications for food web
   CTX models and management of ciguatera poisoning in endemic regions
   where the frequency of environmental algal toxin pulses may be greater
   than the growth-corrected half-life of C-CTX in
   intermediate-trophic-level fish with high site fidelity.},

Abstract = {The neurotoxin domoic acid is produced in quantity by the diatom
   Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and is released to the environment directly
   and indirectly via food chains. Presumably there is a mechanism for the
   biodegradation and disposal of domoic acid and as bacteria are logical
   candidates for such an activity, a search for bacteria competent to
   carry out biodegradation of domoic acid was initiated. Extensive trials
   with a wide Variety of bacteria isolated mainly from muds and waters
   taken from the marine environment showed that the ability to grow on or
   degrade domoic acid was rare; in fact, domoic acid was inhibitory to
   resting cells or growing cultures of most of these bacteria. In
   contrast, using enrichment techniques, it was possible to isolate from
   molluscan species that eliminate domoic acid readily, i.e., blue mussels
   (Mytillus edulis) and soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), bacteria that
   exhibited growth with and biodegradation of domoic acid when
   supplemented with low concentrations of growth factors. The species that
   retain domoic acid for lengthy periods, such as sea scallops
   (Placopecten magellanics) and red mussels (Modiolus modiolus), only
   occasionally yielded bacteria with this capability. The differences may
   be a result of the mechanisms used by the different shellfish in dealing
   with domoic acid, i.e., freely available in the blue mussels and
   softshell clams but likely sequestered in the digestive glands of sea
   scallops and red mussels and thus, largely unavailable for bacterial
   utilization. The results show that Mytilus edulis and Mya arenaria,
   almost uniquely, are prime and reliable sources of domoic acid utilizing
   bacteria. These findings suggest a strong possibility that autochthonous
   bacteria may be significant factors in the elimination of the neurotoxin
   in these two species of shellfish.},

Title = {Involvement of Caspase Activation in Azaspiracid-Induced Neurotoxicity
   in Neocortical Neurons},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {323-334},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a novel group of marine phycotoxins that have
   been associated with severe human intoxication. We found that AZA-1
   exposure increased lactate dehydrogense (LDH) efflux in murine
   neocortical neurons. AZA-1 also produced nuclear condensation and
   stimulated caspase-3 activity with an half maximal effective
   concentration (EC50) value of 25.8nM. These data indicate that AZA-1
   triggers neuronal death in neocortical neurons by both necrotic and
   apoptotic mechanisms. An evaluation of the structure-activity
   relationships of AZA analogs on LDH efflux and caspase-3 activation
   demonstrated that the full structure of AZAs was required to produce
   necrotic or apoptotic cell death. The similar potencies of AZA-1 to
   stimulate LDH efflux and caspase-3 activation and the parallel
   structure-activity relationships of azaspiracid analogs in the two
   assays are consistent with a common molecular target for both responses.
   To explore the molecular mechanism for AZA-1 induced neurotoxicity, we
   assessed the influence of AZA-1 on Ca2+ homeostasis. AZA-1 suppressed
   spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations (EC50 = 445nM) in neocortical neurons. A
   distinct structure-activity profile was found for inhibition of Ca2+
   oscillations where both the full structure as well as analogs containing
   only the FGHI domain attached to a phenyl glycine methyl ester moiety
   were potent inhibitors. The molecular targets for inhibition of
   spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations and neurotoxicity may therefore differ.
   The caspase protease inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK produced a complete elimination
   of AZA-1 induced LDH efflux and nuclear condensation in neocortical
   neurons. Although the molecular target for AZA-induced neurotoxicity
   remains to be established, these results demonstrate that the observed
   neurotoxicity is dependent on a caspase signaling pathway.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxin-3 was shown previously to adversely affect central auditory
   function in goldfish. The present study evaluated the effects of
   exposure to this agent on cochlear function in mice using the 2f(1)-f(2)
   distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). Towards this end,
   inbred CBA/CaJ mice were exposed to a relatively high concentration of
   brevetoxin-3 (similar to 400 mu g/m(3)) by nose-only inhalation for a
   2-h period. Further, a subset of these mice received a second exposure a
   day later that lasted for an additional 4 h. Mice exposed only once for
   2 h did not exhibit any notable cochlear effects. Similarly, mice
   exposed two times, for a cumulative dose of 6 h, exhibited essentially
   no change in DPOAE levels.},

Abstract = {As filter feeders, bivalves and ascidians can accumulate contaminants
   present in the environment and pass them on to higher food chain levels
   as vectors. The consumption of bivalves contaminated with the potent
   neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in
   humans. The aim of this study was to determine seasonal differences in
   occurrence and accumulation of this phycotoxin in European oysters
   (Ostrea edulis Linnaeus, 1758) (n = 46), Queen scallops (Aequipecten
   opercularis Linnaeus, 1758) (n = 53), and edible ascidians of the
   Microcosmus spp. (n = 107), originating from the same harvesting area in
   the Northern Adriatic Sea. The quantification was performed using
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS) preceded by derivatization with dansyl chloride. DA was found
   in very low concentrations throughout the year, with a maximum value of
   810 mu g/kg in Queen scallops. This study reveals differences in the
   occurrence and accumulation of DA between Queen scallops and the other
   two investigated species (oysters and ascidians) and the highest
   concentrations during the colder part of the year. Even though DA was
   detected in all of them, Queen scallops showed higher DA accumulation
   compared to the other two (p < 0.001), hence representing a sentinel
   species suitable for the monitoring of DA level in seafood.},

Abstract = {The metabolism and elimination of brevetoxins were examined in the
   Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) following controlled exposures to
   Karenia brevis cultures in the laboratory. After a 2-day exposure period
   (similar to62 million cells/oyster), elimination of brevetoxins and
   their metabolites was monitored by using liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS). Composite toxin in oyster extracts was measured by
   in vitro assay (i.e. cytotoxicity, receptor binding, and ELISA). Of the
   parent algal toxins, PbTx-1 and PbTx-2 were not detectable by LC/MS in
   K. brevis-exposed oysters. PbTx-3 and PbTx-9, which are accumulated
   directly from K. brevis and through metabolic reduction of PbTx-2 in the
   oyster, were at levels initially (after exposure) of 0.74 and 0.49 mug
   equiv./g, respectively, and were eliminated largely within 2 weeks after
   dosing. PbTx-7 and PbTx-10, the reduced forms of PbTx-1, were
   non-detectable. Conjugative brevetoxin metabolites identified previously
   in field-exposed oysters were confirmed in the laboratory-exposed
   oysters. Cysteine conjugates of PbTx-1 and PbTx-2, and their sulfoxides,
   were in the highest abundance, as apparent in LC/MS ion traces, and were
   detectable for up to 6 months after dosing. Composite toxin measurements
   by in vitro assay also reflected persistence (up to 6 months) of
   brevetoxin residues in the oyster. Levels of cysteine conjugates, as
   determined by LC/MS, were well correlated with those of composite toxin,
   as measured by ELISA, throughout depuration. Composite toxin levels by
   cytotoxicity assay were well correlated with those by receptor binding
   assay. Cysteine-PbTx conjugates are useful LC/MS determinants of
   brevetoxin exposure and potential markers for composite toxin in the
   Eastern oyster. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Screening Tool for the Direct Analysis of Marine and Freshwater
   Phycotoxins in Organic SPATT Extracts from the Chesapeake Bay},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many detection methods for phycotoxins, bioactive compounds produced by
   harmful algae, focus on one compound or a class of related compounds.
   Multiple harmful algal species often co-occur in the environment,
   however, emphasizing the need to analyze for the presence of multiple
   groups of marine and freshwater phycotoxins in environmental samples,
   e.g., extracts from solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT). Two
   methods were developed to screen for 13 phycotoxins (microcystin-RR,
   -LR, -YR, azaspiracid-1, -2, karlotoxin 3, goniodomin A, brevetoxin-2,
   yessotoxin, pectenotoxin-2, dinophysistoxin-1, -2, and okadaic acid) in
   organic SPATT extracts using ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) equipped with a
   trapping dimension (trap) and at-column dilution (ACD). The performance
   of each compound under 36 combinations of chromatographic conditions was
   characterized, and two final methods, acidic and basic, were selected
   based on peak shapes, signal intensities, resolution, and the separation
   in time of positive and negative MS ionization modes. Injection volumes
   of up to 1 mL were possible through trap/ACD technology, resulting in
   limits of detection between 0.001 and 0.05 mu g/L across the analytes.
   Benefits highlighted in this study, beyond the improved detection limits
   and co-detection of multiple toxin groups, include the ability to inject
   samples of 100\% organic solvent, ensuring analyte stability and
   streamlining workflow through the elimination of laborious sample
   preparation steps.},

Title = {Evaluation of marine biotoxin's accumulation by Acanthocardia

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Acanthocardia tuberculatum is a bivalve mollusc that presents recurrent
   problems of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) contamination in the
   Mediterranean coasts of Spain and Morocco. Although not commercially
   exploited from the Portuguese south coast, it represents an alternative
   for reducing the harvest pressure on species presently exploited.
   Evaluation of accumulation of marine biotoxins was carried out by HPLC
   in this species, harvested during a campaign carried out in April 2001
   aimed at evaluating bivalve's resources that covered the entire
   Portuguese south coast.
   PSP toxins were studied by automated pre-column oxidation. Toxins were
   found in specimens from all stations, but always under the regulatory
   limit of 80 mug STX eq./100 g. Saxitoxin and decarbamoyl-saxitoxin were
   the only PSP toxins unambiguously identified. In commercially exploited
   species, saxitoxin and analogues were not detected.
   The amnesic toxin domoic acid was found, but in levels similar to those
   found in species commercially exploited, and always under the regulatory
   limit of 20 mug/g. A fast elimination, and not a prolonged retention. of
   domoic acid seems to occur in A. tuberculatum in view of the levels
   close to or higher than 20 mug/g found in commercial bivalves harvested
   the two preceding months. The diarrhoeic toxin okadaic acid was found at
   trace levels much under the allowable level, similar to what was
   happening with other species harvested during the same period. (C) 2002

Abstract = {An opportunistic investigation into ecosystem instability in Kachemak
   Bay (KBay), Alaska, has led us to investigate exposure to toxic algae in
   sea otters. We used gene expression to explore the physiological health
   of sea otters sampled in KBay in May 2019. We found altered levels of
   gene transcripts in comparison with reference sea otters from clinically
   normal, oil-exposed, and nutritionally challenged populations sampled
   over the past decade. KBay sea otters were markedly divergent from the
   other groups for five genes, which indicated the involvement of
   neurological, cardiac, immune, and detoxification systems. Further,
   analyses of urine and fecal samples detected domoic acid in the KBay sea
   otters. In combination, these results may point to chronic, low-level
   exposure to an algal toxin, such as domoic acid. With a warming climate,
   the frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms in marine
   environments is anticipated to increase, and novel molecular
   technologies to detect sublethal or chronic exposure to algal toxins
   will help provide an early warning of threats to the stability of
   populations and ecosystems.},

Title = {First report of the use of a saxitoxin-protein conjugate to develop a
   DNA aptamer to a small molecule toxin},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {30-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Saxitoxin (STX) is a low molecular weight neurotoxin mainly produced by
   certain marine dinoflagellates that, along with its family of similarly
   related paralytic shellfish toxins, may cause the potentially fatal
   intoxication known as paralytic shellfish poisoning. Illness and
   fatality rates are low due to the effective monitoring programs that
   determine when toxins exceed the established regulatory action level and
   effectuate shellfish harvesting closures accordingly. Such monitoring
   programs rely on the ability to rapidly screen large volumes of samples.
   Many of the screening assays currently available employ antibodies or
   live animals. This research focused on developing an analytical
   recognition element that would eliminate the challenges associated with
   the limited availability of antibodies and the use of animals. Here we
   report the discovery of a DNA aptamer that targets STX.
   Concentration-dependent and selective binding of the aptamer to STX was
   determined using a surface plasmon resonance sensor. Not only does this
   work represent the first reported aptamer to SIX, but also the first
   aptamer to any marine biotoxin. A novel strategy of using a toxin
   protein conjugate for DNA aptamer selection was successfully implemented
   to overcome the challenges associated with aptamer selection to small
   molecules. Taking advantage of such an approach could lead to increased
   diversity and accessibility of aptamers to low molecular weight toxins,
   which could then be incorporated as analytical recognition elements in
   diagnostic assays for foodborne toxin detection. The selected STX
   aptamer sequence is provided here, making it available to any
   investigator for use in assay development for the detection of SIX.

Abstract = {Blooms of Karenia brevis produce brevetoxins which cause neurotoxic
   shellfish poisoning and respiratory symptoms in humans as well as
   harmful effects on sea life. To investigate potential effects of
   brevetoxins on immune system components a monocyte cell line, (U-937)
   was exposed in vitro to PbTx-2. U-937 cells metabolized PbTx-2 through
   cellular detoxification mechanisms, as evidenced by depletion of
   intracellular glutathione and formation of glutathione and cysteine
   conjugates. Total intracellular glutathione was significantly decreased
   in toxin-treated cells compared to control cells, as measured using an
   enzymatic recycling method. LC/MS was used to detect the following
   brevetoxin metabolites: a cysteine-PbTx-2 conjugate (m/z 1018) and two
   putative glutathione-PbTx-2 conjugates (m/z 1204 and 1222). During 3 h
   incubation, glutathione conjugates were detectable as early as 1 h and
   increased in concentration after 2 and 3 h. A cysteine-PbTx-2 conjugate
   appeared after 2 h and increased in concentration after 3 h. Detectable
   levels of brevetoxin conjugates were present in response to toxin
   concentrations of 1 PM. Depletion of intracellular glutathione and
   formation of brevetoxin metabolites, with changes in concentrations over
   time, suggest immune cells (U-937) have important cellular
   detoxification pathways for PbTx-2. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Degradation of okadaic acid in seawater by UV/TiO2
   photocatalysis - Proof of concept},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {733},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The consumption of contaminated shellfish with marine toxins causes
   adverse socioeconomical, environmental and health impacts. The marine
   toxin okadaic acid (OA) provokes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)
   syndrome characterized by severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore,
   there is increasing interest in removing these toxins from the marine
   environment to protect shellfish harvesting sites. Photocatalysis is
   proposed as an efficient method to detoxify the marine environment.
   In this study, Prorocentrum lima was used to produce high purity DSP
   toxins, in particular OA, for degradation studies. The profiling,
   characterization and quantification of DSP toxins in the culture of P.
   lima were achieved by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography
   coupled to quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MSE)
   for accurate-mass full spectrum acquisition data. The effectiveness of
   UV/TiO2 system to degrade OA in seawater was assessed in lab-scale
   experiments and identification of transformation products was proposed
   based on the data obtained during analysis by UPLC-QTOF-MSE. The
   detoxification potential of the UV/TiO2 system was investigated using
   the phosphatase inhibition assay.
   Sufficient amount of high-purity OA (25 mg, >90\% purity) was produced
   in-house for use in photocatalysis experiments by simple reversed-phase
   flash chromatography. Complete degradation of OA was observed in
   seawater after 30 min and 7.5 min in deionized water. The rate constants
   fitted with the pseudo-first order kinetic model (R-2 > 0.96).
   High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of the photocatalyzed OA
   allowed tentative identification of four transformation products.
   Detoxification was achieved in parallel with the degradation of OA in
   deionized water and artificial ocean water (<= 20 min) but not for
   seawater. Overall, results suggest that UV/TiO2 photocatalysis can be an
   effective approach for degrading OA and their TPs in the marine
   environment.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of
   photocatalysis to degrade marine toxins and its promising potential to
   protect shellfish harvesting sites.},

Abstract = {The need to have methods as alternatives to animal bioassays for
   marine-toxin detection is of paramount importance. Such methods require
   not only identification of each of the analogs in a phycotoxin group but
   also the toxicity of each analog. Depending on the nature of the method,
   not all that have been proposed as potential replacements are equally
   suitable for the task. The evidence suggests that physico-chemical
   methods are by far the most prone to generating larger errors.
   Antibody-based methods in many cases exhibit the same difficulties,
   whilst receptor-based methods have been developed to measure the
   concentrations of toxin present in samples based on the relative
   toxicity of all analogs. This review identifies the advantages and the
   disadvantages of each type of method, with particular emphasis on
   toxicity identification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The ingestion of seafood contaminated with the marine biotoxin okadaic
   acid (OA) can lead to diarrhetic shellfish poisoning with symptoms like
   nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. Both rat and the human hepatic
   cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) metabolize OA. However, liver cell
   toxicity of metabolized OA is mainly unclear. The aim of our study was
   to detect the cellular effects in HepG2 cells exposed to OA in the
   presence of recombinant CYP enzymes of both rat and human for the
   investigation of species differences. The results should be set in
   correlation with a CYP-specific metabolite pattern. Comparative
   metabolite profiles of OA after incubation in rat and human recombinant
   CYP enzymes were established by using LC-MS/MS technique. Results
   demonstrated that metabolism of OA to oxygenated metabolites correlates
   with detoxification which was mainly catalyzed by human CYP3A4 and
   CYP3A5. Detoxification by rat Cyp3a1 was lower compared to human CYP3A
   enzymes and activation of OA by Cyp3a2 was observed, coincident with
   minor overall conversion capacity of OA. By contrast human and rat
   CYP1A2 seem to activate OA into cytotoxic intermediates. In conclusion,
   different mechanisms of OA metabolism may occur in the liver. At low OA
   doses, the human liver is likely well protected against cytotoxic OA,
   but for high shellfish consumers a potential risk cannot be excluded.},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA) and OA binding protein 2 (OABP2) were previously
   isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. Because the amino
   acid sequence of OABP2 is completely different from that of protein
   phosphatase 2A, a well-known target of OA, we have been investigating
   the production and function of OABP2. In the present study, we
   hypothesized that OABP2 plays a role in the detoxification of OA in H.
   okadai and that the OA concentrations are in proportional to the OABP2
   concentrations in the sponge specimens. Based on the OA concentrations
   and the OABP2 concentrations in the sponge specimens collected in
   various places and in different seasons, however, we could not determine
   a positive correlation between OA and OABP2. We then attempted to
   determine distribution of OA and OABP2 in the sponge specimen. When the
   mixture of dissociated sponge cells and symbiotic species were separated
   with various pore-sized nylon meshes, most of the OA and OABP2 was
   detected from the same 0-10 mu m fraction. Next, when sponge cell
   clusters were prepared from a mixture of dissociated sponge cells and
   symbiotic species in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin, we
   identified the 18S rDNA of H. okadai and the gene of OABP2 in the
   analysis of genomic DNA but could not detect OA by LC-MS/MS. We thus
   concluded that the sponge cells express OABP2, and that OA was not
   apparently present in the sponge cells but could be colocalized with
   OABP2 in the sponge cells at a concentration less than the limit of
   detection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The paralytic shellfish poison family has been recently extended by the
   discovery of several analogues possessing a hydoxybenzoate moiety
   instead of the carbamoyl group one finds in saxitoxin, the parent
   molecule of this toxin family. We have investigated the potency of these
   new analogues on a representative isoform of the pharmacological target
   of these toxins, the voltage gated sodium channel. These toxins were
   found to have K-I's in the low nanomolar range, only slightly less
   potent than saxitoxin. The hydroxybenzoate group may increase the
   lipophilicity of these toxins and improve their ability to pass through
   epithelia and therefore its uptake and elimination in both intoxication
   victims and animals that bioaccumulate paralytic shellfish toxins. (C)

Title = {Aqueous photodegradation of okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-1:
   Persistence, kinetics, photoproducts, pathways, and toxicity evaluation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins are a class of natural
   organic contaminants that pose a serious threat not only to marine
   ecosystems and fisheries but also to human health. They are widely
   distributed in coastal and offshore waters around the world. However,
   the persistence and photochemical degradation characteristics of DSP in
   an aqueous environment are still unclear.This study aimed to elucidate
   the photochemical fate of two representative DSP toxins, namely, okadaic
   acid (OA) and dinophysishaxin-1 (DTX1). Results showed that
   photomediated chemical reactions play a crucial role in eliminating DSP
   toxins in seawater. However, the degradation of OA and DTX1 was
   relatively slow under natural solar radiation, with a removal efficiency
   of 90.0\% after exposure for more than 20 days. When the reaction
   solutions of OA and DTX1 were exposed to Hg lamp radiation, their
   degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and was remarkably
   influenced by seawater pH and metal-ion concentration. A total of 24
   tentative transformation products (TPs) of OA and DIX1 were identified
   via liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. C12
   (C43H66O11) and C24 (C44H68O11) were the main TPs. The following
   possible photodegradation pathways were proposed: decarboxylation,
   photoinduced hydrolysis, chain scission, and photo-oxidation. Toxicity
   assays via protein phosphatase 2A inhibition proved that photochemical
   processes could significantly reduce the DSP toxicity of irradiated
   solutions by approximately 88\%. This work provides an enhanced
   understanding of the fate of DSP toxins in the aqueous environment,
   allowing for an improved assessment of their environmental impacts. (C)

Abstract = {Domoic acid concentrations up to 160 mug g-1 shellfish meat were
   reported in razor clams on the  Washington/Oregon coasts in the fall of
   1991. Toxin levels in the clams remained above the regulatory closure
   level of 20 mug g-1 for at least 6 months. In summer, 1992, razor clams,
   averaging about 10 mug g-1 of domoic acid toxin, were maintained under
   laboratory conditions to determine bow long it would take them to be
   free of the toxin. Periodically, edible (foot, siphon, and mantle) and
   non-edible (gill, digestive gland, and gonad) parts were tested for
   domoic acid. After 86 days, toxin levels remained near the original
   levels, but at least one clam in each group of six tested contained ca
   22 mug g-1 reflecting the clam-to-clam variability in their natural
   habitat. It appears that razor clams are able to depurate domoic acid in
   their natural environment, but may maintain a low level of domoic acid
   for long periods.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a neuroexcitatory amino acid that is produced by
   Pseudo-nitzschia during harmful algal blooms (HAB). Accumulation of DA
   can be transferred through food chain and cause neuronal damage in
   marine animal and in human. Like other algal toxins, DA was suggested to
   increase the oxidative stress and increase the detoxification-related
   gene expression in fish. The widely used food antioxidant,
   tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), was known to induce a wide range of
   antioxidative potentials such as elevation of the glutathione levels and
   glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), via the activation of antioxidant
   response elements (AREs). In this study, the influences of dietary tBHQ
   on domoic acid (DA) metabolism and detoxification-related gene
   transcription were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Oral
   administration of tBHQ resulted in significant decreases of DA
   accumulation of liver tissues in which red sea bream were fed with a
   single dose of 10 mg DA and 100 mg tBHQ per kg body weight per fish.
   Real-time PCR further revealed that the mRNA levels of
   AHR/ARNT/CYP1A1/IGSTA1/GSTR were up-regulated in the above liver tissues
   at 72 h post tBHQ treatment. In consistence, tBHQ exposure also resulted
   in increased mRNA transcription of GSTA1, GSTA2 and GSTR in cultured red
   sea bream hepatocytes. Collectively, our findings in this research
   suggested that the dietary intake of tBHQ accelerated DA metabolism in
   fish, through mechanisms involving altered transcription of
   detoxification-related liver genes.},

Abstract = {Florida red tides have become more common and persistent in and around
   the Gulf of Mexico. When in bloom, red tides can produce brevetoxins in
   high concentrations, leading to human exposures primarily through
   contaminated food and ocean spray. The research described here includes
   adapting and validating a commercial brevetoxin water test kit for human
   plasma testing. Pooled plasma was fortified with a model brevetoxin,
   brevetoxin 3, at concentrations from 0.00500 to 3.00 ng/mL to generate
   calibration curves and quality control samples. The quantitative
   detection range was determined to be 0.0400-2.00 ng/mL brevetoxin 3
   equivalents with inter- and intraday accuracies ranging from 94.0\% to
   109\% and relative standard deviations <20\%, which is within the US
   Food and Drug Administration guidelines for receptor-binding assays.
   Additionally, cross-reactivity was tested using 4 of the 10 known
   brevetoxins and 12 paralytic shellfish toxins. The cross-reactivity
   varied from 0.173\% to 144\% for the commercially available brevetoxin
   standards and 0\% for the commercially available paralytic shellfish
   toxin standards. Fifty individual unexposed human plasma samples were
   measured to determine the limit of detection and endogenous
   interferences to the test. The validated method was used to test 31
   plasma samples collected from humans potentially exposed to brevetoxins,
   detecting 11 positives. This method has been proven useful to measure
   human exposure to brevetoxins and can be applied to future exposure
   events.},

Abstract = {The toxicokinetics of brevetoxin {[}H-3]PbTx-3 were studied in the gulf
   toadfish (Opsanus beta) implanted with an indwelling cannula in the
   caudal vein. After an intravenous bolus injection (0.5-mu-g/kg), the
   concentration of {[}H-3]PbTx-3 in blood declined rapidly and
   triphasically with a terminal half-life of elimination of 29 min. The
   toxicokinetics of {[}H-3]PbTx-3 were best described by a
   threecompartment open model with the central compartment representing
   the blood of toadfish. One hour following {[}H-3]PbTx-3 administration,
   radioactivity was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest
   proportions in the muscle, intestine and liver (40.2, 18.5 and 12.4\% of
   body burden, respectively). Through 96 h, levels of radioactivity in the
   liver remained relatively constant, while levels in bile, kidney and
   skin increased, and the amounts in all other tissues decreased.
   Extraction of toadfish bile by chloroform and subsequent thin layer
   chromatography, revealed the presence of both aqueous-soluble and
   organic-soluble metabolites of PbTx-3. The results are discussed in the
   context of potential mechanisms of metabolism and excretion, and the
   residence times of PbTx-3 in fish tissues vis a vis potential health
   risks.},

Title = {Fate of domoic acid ingested by the copepod Acartia clausi},

Abstract = {Two important issues in the studies of harmful algae include ecological
   role of the toxic compounds and their fate through the food web. The
   aims of this study were to determine whether the production of domoic
   acid is a strategy evolved to avoid predation and the role of copepods
   in the fate of this toxic compound through the food web. The copepod
   Acartia clausi was fed with single and mixed cultures of the toxic
   diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries and the non-toxic diatom
   Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima. Ingestion rate as a function of diatom
   abundance was the same for the toxic and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia
   species, indicating no selective feeding behaviour against P.
   multiseries. The toxins ingested by the copepods did not affect
   mortality, feeding behaviour, egg production and egg hatching of the
   copepods. Copepods assimilated the 4.8\% of the total domoic acid
   ingested. Although the amount of toxins daily detoxificated by the
   copepods was 63.6\%, the copepods accumulated domoic acid in their
   tissues. We conclude that domoic acid is not toxic for copepods and,
   probably for this reason, this toxin does not act as feeding deterrent
   for copepods. However, even though the production of domoic acid has
   apparently not evolved to deter predation, copepods may play an
   important role on the fate of this toxic compound through the marine
   food web.},

Title = {Metagenomics reveals that detoxification systems are underrepresented in
   marine bacterial communities},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: Environmental shotgun sequencing (metagenomics) provides a
   new way to study communities in microbial ecology. We here use sequence
   data from the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition to investigate
   toxicant selection pressures revealed by the presence of detoxification
   genes in marine bacteria. To capture a broad range of potential
   toxicants we selected detoxification protein families representing
   systems protecting microorganisms from a variety of stressors, such as
   metals, organic compounds, antibiotics and oxygen radicals.
   Results: Using a bioinformatics procedure based on comparative analysis
   to finished bacterial genomes we found that the amount of detoxification
   genes present in marine microorganisms seems surprisingly small. The
   underrepresentation is particularly evident for toxicant transporters
   and proteins involved in detoxifying metals. Exceptions are enzymes
   involved in oxidative stress defense where peroxidase enzymes are more
   abundant in marine bacteria compared to bacteria in general. In
   contrast, catalases are almost completely absent from the open ocean
   environment, suggesting that peroxidases and peroxiredoxins constitute a
   core line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the marine
   milieu.
   Conclusions: We found no indication that detoxification systems would be
   generally more abundant close to the coast compared to the open ocean.
   On the contrary, for several of the protein families that displayed a
   significant geographical distribution, like peroxidase, penicillin
   binding transpeptidase and divalent ion transport protein, the open
   ocean samples showed the highest abundance. Along the same lines, the
   abundance of most detoxification proteins did not increase with
   estimated pollution. The low level of detoxification systems in marine
   bacteria indicate that the majority of marine bacteria have a low
   capacity to adapt to increased pollution. Our study exemplifies the use
   of metagenomics data in ecotoxicology, and in particular how
   anthropogenic consequences on life in the sea can be examined.},

Title = {Toxicokinetics of domoic acid in the fetal rat},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {294},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin that has both marine wildlife
   and human health impacts, including developmental effects during
   prenatal exposure in rodent models. However, little is known regarding
   DA toxicokinetics in the fetal unit during maternal-fetal transfer.
   Tissue distribution and toxicokinetics of DA were investigated in
   pregnant rats and their pups just prior to birth at gestational day 20.
   Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were given an intravenous dose of 1.0 mg
   DA/kg and samples of maternal plasma, fetal plasma, placenta, amniotic
   fluid and fetal brain were taken at intervals over 24 h. Toxicokinetic
   parameters were determined using WinNonLin software analysis. Maternal
   plasma DA log concentration-time curves fit a two compartment
   pharmacokinetic profile, with alpha and beta half-lives of elimination
   of 26.9 and 297 min, respectively. Placenta had a C-max of 752 ng/mL and
   a terminal half-life of 577 min. Maternal-fetal transfer between the
   plasma compartments was 31\% with a fetal plasma C-max of 86 ng/mL at 60
   min and terminal half-life of 553 min. Amniotic fluid and fetal brain
   had overall averages of 27 +/- 12 ng/mL and 8.12 ng/g, respectively, and
   did not show evidence of elimination over 24 h. The longer fetal
   retention of DA. particularly in amniotic fluid, indicates that the
   fetus may be continually re-exposed during gestation, which could
   potentially lead to a disease state even at small exposure dose. This
   has implications for the California sea lions (Zalophus californianus),
   which exhibit an epilepsy-like disease that arises months after DA
   producing blooms. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Title = {Isolation and characterization of okadaic acid binding proteins from the

Abstract = {Okadaic acid, first isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai,
   is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1and 2A (PP1 and PP2A,
   respectively). Photoaffinity labeling experiments previously performed
   with biotinylated photoreactive okadaic acid revealed the presence of
   okadaic acid binding protein (OABP) in the crude extract of H. okadai.
   In this article, ABP1 and OABP2 were purified from H. okadai as guided
   by the binding affinity of {[}27-H-3]okadaic acid. OABPl has an
   approximate molecular mass of 37 kDa in SDS-PAGE analysis. Edman
   degradation followed by molecular cloning and sequencing identified
   OABPl as being 88\% identical to the rabbit PP2A beta catalytic subunit.
   On the other hand, HPLC analysis revealed that OABP2 consists of three
   22 kDa proteins (OABP2.1, OABP2.2, and OABP2.3). Electrospray ionization
   mass spectrometry indicated that OABP2.1 and OABP2.2 form a complex with
   okadaic acid. The complete amino acid sequence of OABP2, determined by
   Edman degradation and molecular cloning, showed that OABP2.1 is 96\%
   identical to OABP2.2 and 66\% identical to OABP2.3, while being very
   slightly homologous to any protein phosphatases known to date. OABP2 did
   not exhibit phosphatase activity, though it bound to okadaic acid with a
   K-d of 0.97 nM. Furthermore, OABP2 was not detected in the sponge
   Halichondria japonica or the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima. We thus
   speculated that OABP2 might be involved in detoxifying okadaic acid.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxins are potent neurotoxins produced by the marine dinoflagellate
   Karenia brevis. Exposure to brevetoxins may occur during a K. brevis red
   tide when the compounds become aerosolized by wind and surf. This study
   assesses possible adverse health effects associated with short-term
   inhalation exposure to brevetoxin 3. Male F344/Crl/Br rats were exposed
   to 500 mug brevetoxin 3/m(3) by nose-only inhalation for 0.5 or 2 h/d
   for 5 consecutive days. Control rats were sham exposed for 2 h to
   vehicle. Calculated deposited brevetoxin doses were 8.3 and 33 mug/kg/d
   for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. At the termination of
   exposures, only body weights of the high-dose group (Group B) were
   significantly below control values. By immunohistochemistry (IHC) small
   numbers of splenic and peribronchiolar lymphoid tissue macrophages
   stained positive for brevetoxin, while nasal mucosa, liver, and brain
   were IHC negative for brevetoxin. No gross or microscopic lesions were
   observed in any tissue examined. There was no biochemical evidence of
   cytotoxicity or inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Alveolar
   macrophages showed some evidence of activation following brevetoxin
   exposure. Humoral-mediated immunity was suppressed in brevetoxin-exposed
   rats as indicated by a >70\% reduction in splenic plaque-forming cells
   in brevetoxin-exposed animals compared to controls. Results suggest that
   the immune system may be a target of toxicity following brevetoxin
   inhalation. Future studies will focus on identification of a no-effect
   level and mechanisms underlying brevetoxin-induced immune suppression.},

Title = {Fate and distribution of brevetoxin (PbTx) following lysis of Karenia
   brevis by algicidal bacteria, including analysis of open A-ring
   derivatives},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {50},

Pages = {1175-1191},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Flavobacteriaceae (strain SO3) and Cytophaga sp. (strain 41-DBG2) are
   algicidal bacteria active against the brevetoxin (PbTx)-producing, red
   tide dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. Little is known about the fate of
   PbTx associated with K brevis cells following attack by such bacteria.
   The fate and distribution of PbTx in K brevis cultures exposed to these
   algicidal strains were thus examined by receptor binding assay and
   liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) in three size fractions
   (>5,0.22-5, <0.22 mu m) over a 2-week time course. In control cultures,
   brevetoxin concentrations in the > 5 mu m particulate size fraction
   correlated with changes in cell density, whereas significant increases
   in dissolved (i.e., < 0.22 mu m) toxin were observed in the later stages
   of culture growth. Exposure of K brevis to either of the two algicidal
   bacteria tested caused cell lysis, coinciding with a rapid decline in
   the > 5 mu m PbTX size fraction and a simultaneous release of dissolved
   toxin into the growth medium. Upon cell lysis, dissolved brevetoxin
   accounted for ca. 60\% of total toxin and consisted of 51-82\% open
   A-ring derivatives. Open A-ring PbTx-2 and PbTx-3 derivatives bound with
   lower affinity (approximately 22- and 57-fold, respectively) to
   voltage-gated sodium channels and were considerably less cytotoxic (86-
   and 142-fold, respectively) to N2A cells than their individual parent
   toxins (i.e., PbTx-2 and PbTx-3). These novel findings of changes in
   PbTx size-fractioned distribution and overall reduction in K brevis
   toxicity following attack by algicidal bacteria improve our
   understanding of potential trophic transfer routes and the fate of PbTx
   during red tide events. Moreover, this information will be important to
   consider when evaluating the potential role of algicidal bacteria in
   harmful algal bloom (HAB) management strategies involving control of
   bloom populations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid is a marine biotoxin that primarily occurs in shellfish and
   can cause diarrheic shellfish poisoning in humans. When analyzing
   biological samples using liquid chromatography with tandem mass
   spectrometry, the presence of complex matrices is a major issue. Thus,
   it is crucial to selectively and simply extract the target analyte from
   samples and minimize matrix effects simultaneously. To meet this need,
   an immunomagnetic- bead- based liquid chromatography with tandem mass
   spectrometry method was developed to detect okadaic acid in shellfish.
   Magnetic beads bound to monoclonal antibody against okadaic acid were
   used as affinity probes to specifically enrich okadaic acid in samples,
   which effectively eliminated matrix effects. A magnetic separator was
   used to aggregate and separate magnetic particles from sample matrices,
   and methanol was used to elute okadaic acid from the magnetic beads.
   Standard solution prepared with methanolwas employed directly for
   quantitative analysis. Several experimental conditions were optimized to
   improve performance. The method is of interest as a rapid (10 min)
   sample clean-up and selective enrichment tool, and it showed good
   linearity and sensitivity, with reported limits of detection and
   quantitation of 3 and 10 mu g/kg, respectively. Fifty-three shellfish
   samples from an aquatic products market were tested using this method,

Title = {Domoic acid uptake and elimination kinetics in oysters and mussels in
   relation to body size and anatomical distribution of toxin},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {100},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Toxin accumulation by suspension-feeding qualifier depends on a balance
   between processes regulating toxin uptake (i.e. ingestion and absorption
   of toxic cells) and elimination (i.e. egestion, exchange among tissues,
   excretion, degradation and/or biotransformation) during exposure to
   toxic blooms. This laboratory study compares the size-specific uptake
   and elimination kinetics of domoic acid (DA) from Pseudo-nitzschia
   multiseries in two co-occurring bivalves, the oyster Crassostrea
   virginica and the mussel Mytilus edulis. Domoic acid concentrations were
   measured in visceral and non-visceral tissues of different-sized oysters
   and mussels during simultaneous long-term exposure to toxic P.
   multiseries cells in the laboratory, followed by depuration on a
   non-toxic algal diet. Mussels attained 7-17-fold higher DA
   concentrations than oysters, depending on the body size and exposure
   time, and also detoxified DA at higher rates (1.4-1.6 d(-1)) than
   oysters (0.25-0.88 d(-1)) of a comparable size. Small oysters attained
   markedly higher weight-specific DA concentrations (maximum = 78.6 mu g
   g(-1)) than large, market-sized individuals (<= 13 mu g g(-1)), but no
   clear relationship was found between body size and DA concentration in
   mussels (maximum = 460 mu g g(-1)). Therefore, differential DA
   accumulation by the two species was, on average, similar to 3-fold more
   pronounced for large bivalves. An inverse relationship between DA
   elimination rate and body size was established for oysters but not
   mussels. Elimination of DA was faster in viscera than in other tissues
   of both bivalves; DA exchange rate from the former to the latter was
   higher in oysters. The contribution of viscera to the total DA burden of
   mussels was consistently greater than that of other tissues during both
   uptake (>80\%) and deputation (>65\%) phases, whereas it rapidly
   decreased from 70-80\% to 30-40\% in oysters, and this occurred faster
   in smaller individuals. Residual DA concentrations (<= 0.25 mu g g(-1))
   were detected at later deputation stages (up to 14 d), mainly in viscera
   of oysters and non-visceral tissues of mussels, suggesting that a
   second, slower-detoxifying toxin compartment exists in both species.
   However, a simple exponential decay model was found to adequately
   describe DA elimination kinetics in these bivalves. The lower capacity
   for DA accumulation in oysters compared to mussels can thus only be
   explained by the former's comparatively low toxin intake rather than
   faster toxin elimination. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Pages = {6073-6081},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), a potent marine toxin, is readily oxidized upon
   reaction with singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). Detailed product studies revealed
   that the major singlet oxygenation reaction pathways were the {[}2 + 2]
   cycloaddition (60.2\%) and ene reactions (39.8\%) occurring at the Z
   double bond. Diene isomerization and {[}4 + 2] cycloaddition, common for
   conjugated diene systems, were not observed during the singlet
   oxygenation of DA. The bimolecular rate constant for the DA reaction
   with(1)O(2) determined by competition kinetics was 5.1 x 10(5)
   M(-1)s(-1). Based on the rate constant and steady-state concentrations
   of O-1(2) in surface waters, the environmental half-life of DA due to
   singlet oxygen-induced transformations is between 5 and 63 days.
   The(1)O(2) reaction product mixture of DA did not exhibit significant
   biological activity based on ELISA studies, indicating that singlet
   oxygenation could be an important natural detoxification process. The
   characteristic oxidation products can provide valuable markers for the
   risk assessment of DA-contaminated natural waters.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning is a serious public health concern

   used to isolate and measure saxitoxin, the most potent and studied

   with sublethal doses (2 mu g/kg) of saxitoxin. Urine was collected at
   intervals between 4 and 144 hr after injection. Saxitoxin was isolated
   from urine with an ion-exchange procedure, identified, and measured with
   a precolumn-oxidation-HPLC procedure coupled with fluorescence
   detection. The identity of oxidized saxitoxin was confirmed with
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Four hours after injection,
   approximately 19\% of the injected saxitoxin dose was excreted. By 24
   hr, approximately 58\% of the administered dose was excreted. Average
   total urinary excretion of administered saxitoxin was approximately 68\%
   for the full study period. These results demonstrate that small
   quantities of unmetabolized saxitoxin can be detected in rat urine up to
   144 hr after i.v. administration, and that the analytical method may
   have diagnostic potential for saxitoxin intoxication and paralytic

Abstract = {In the fall of 1991 domoic acid was discovered in coastal Pacific razor
   clams Siliqua patula (Dixon, 1789) in Washington and Oregon states at
   levels higher than acceptable for safe human consumption, thereby
   forcing a closure of the recreational harvest. Tissue distribution data
   indicated the clams maintained these elevated levels from fall through
   early summer of 1992 in the edible muscular tissues (mantle, siphon,
   adductor muscles, and muscular foot) with concentrations of toxin
   averaging from 23.3-50.7 mug/g. The concentration in the non-edible
   tissues (gill, digestive gland, gonad, and siphon tip) ranged from trace
   amounts to 8.4 mug/g. Clams that were dissected into edible and non
   edible pooled portions contained 36.4 +/- 22.6 and 13.7 +/- 7.6 mug/g,
   respectively. On an additional sampling date, clams were sampled fresh
   or were frozen whole before sampling. The concentration in the edible
   portion of the fresh clams averaged 16.8 +/- 11.6 mug/g, while the blood
   and dissection fluids contained only trace amounts of toxin. The domoic
   acid concentration of the frozen edible portion averaged 12.6 +/- 6.9
   mug/g with meltwater levels reaching 4.2 mug/g and the dissection fluid
   containing up to 10.0 mug/g. Clams collected in December 1991 with
   elevated levels of toxin (47.9 +/- 12.7 mug/g) that were held on Strait
   of Juan de Fuca seawater for three months maintained this level of
   contamination (44.3 +/- 19.8 mug/g). Razor clams from Alaska held under
   identical conditions during this time period did not contain detectable
   levels of toxin. Razor clam tissues collected in 1985, 1990, and the
   summer of 1991 revealed only trace levels of toxin.},

Title = {Evidence for a Novel Marine Harmful Algal Bloom: Cyanotoxin
   (Microcystin) Transfer from Land to Sea Otters},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {``Super-blooms'' of cyanobacteria that produce potent and
   environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging
   global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring of the marine
   environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although
   microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine
   ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin
   intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic
   transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of
   exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection
   of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter
   necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of
   bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates.
   Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three
   nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine
   Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million
   ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to
   within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally
   listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication.
   Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of
   species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited
   significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and
   slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially
   serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the
   lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex
   marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly
   recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves
   were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for
   wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to
   cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine
   ``harmful algal bloom'' in the Pacific coastal environment; that of
   hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and
   humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish
   harvested at the land-sea interface.},

Abstract = {Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) constitute one of the most important sources
   of contamination in the oceans, producing high concentrations of
   potentially harmful biotoxins that are accumulated across the food
   chains. One such biotoxin, Okadaic Acid (OA), is produced by marine
   dinoflagellates and subsequently accumulated within the tissues of
   filtering marine organisms feeding on HABs, rapidly spreading to their
   predators in the food chain and eventually reaching human consumers
   causing Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) syndrome. While numerous
   studies have thoroughly evaluated the effects of OA in mammals, the
   attention drawn to marine organisms in this regard has been scarce, even
   though they constitute primary targets for this biotoxin. With this in
   mind, the present work aimed to provide a timely and comprehensive
   insight into the current literature on the effect of OA in marine
   invertebrates, along with the strategies developed by these organisms to
   respond to its toxic effect together with the most important methods and
   techniques used for OA detection and evaluation.},

Abstract = {The physiological effects of domoic acid on marine invertebrates which
   are known to accumulate this neurotoxin have not been investigated

   the domoic acid producing diatom, Pseudonitzschia pungens f.
   multiseries, for 48 h followed by a 120 h clearance period. A general
   stress response by C. gigas was characterized by a respiratory acidosis
   from shell closure bs h after introduction of the algae. Haemolymph pH
   in the oyster returned to control levels after 36 h exposure and
   although hypoxic conditions persisted during 48 h exposure PO2 levels
   returned to normal only after 24 h of clearance, Substantial hypercapnia
   and elevated haemolymph bicarbonate occurred after 8 h exposure which
   was rectified during the remaining period of exposure. Body burden of
   domoic acid was greatest in the oyster after 4 h of exposure. At 120 h
   of continuous clearance the gill, muscle, and soft tissue still revealed
   detectable levels of domoic acid. M. californianus exhibited no
   significant change in haemolymph pH on exposure to the alga although a
   slight alkalosis occurred, which is associated normally with increased
   filtration (feeding) and gas exchange. Haemolymph PCO2 and PO2 were
   within the range of established control values throughout the
   experiment, Domoic acid was assimilated to the highest level in gill
   tissue and no detectable concentration of toxin was observed in any
   tissue after 120 h of clearance.},

Title = {Analysis of the importance of lipid breakdown for elimination of okadaic
   acid (diarrhetic shellfish toxin) in mussels, Mytilus edulis::
   results from a field study and a laboratory experiment},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA) is a lipophilic phycotoxin, which accumulates in the
   digestive organs of mussels and may cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning
   (DSP) in humans. Depuration of toxic mussels is a potential option for
   the shellfish industry to increase the availability of marketable
   mussels. To develop cost-effective deputation methods for DSP toxins,
   knowledge about the environmental conditions and physiological processes
   regulating the rate of depuration is essential. In this paper, the
   importance of lipid breakdown for elimination of OA in mussels was
   investigated by performing a field study and a manipulative laboratory
   experiment. First, total lipid content and concurrent concentration of
   OA in the digestive glands of farmed blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was
   analysed on a monthly basis from January to June 2000. A significant
   positive correlation between levels of OA and lipid content was observed
   between January and March, when lipid levels were showing a decreasing
   trend. This supported a previously proposed model that breakdown of
   lipid stores may affect the release and elimination of this lipophilic
   toxin. To test this causal model, a laboratory experiment was performed.
   Mussels containing OA were exposed to experimental treatments (increased
   seawater temperature and/or food limitation) for 24 days in order to
   increase the energy requirements and need to use lipids as an energy
   source. It was predicted that mussels exposed to these treatments would
   have a faster elimination rate of OA compared to feeding mussels kept in
   ambient seawater temperature. The results showed that lipid content was
   significantly reduced in mussels exposed to an increased water
   temperature (24 degreesC) compared to ambient temperature (18 degreesC).
   The amount of lipids was not affected by food limitation. Although lipid
   content was-reduced in 24 degreesC, the rate of depuration of OA was not
   faster for mussels in this treatment and no correlation was detected
   between lipid content and, OA. Depuration rates were very similar for
   all treatments and followed an exponential decrease relationship (t(1/2)
   = 8 days). Thus, the proposed model that lipid breakdown affects the
   mechanism of elimination of OA was not supported. Nevertheless, the
   observed rates of depuration provide useful information and a potential
   predictive too] for large-scale depuration methods of mussels. The
   difficulties to influence the rate of depuration of this toxin by
   changing the environmental conditions suggest that processes,
   insensitive to short-term manipulation of the external environment,
   regulate depuration of OA. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a severe food-borne illness,
   caused by the ingestion of seafood containing paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PST), which are naturally produced by marine dinoflagellates and
   accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms. Novel PST, designated as
   hydroxybenzoate analogues (also known as GC toxins), was relatively
   recently discovered in Gymnodinium catenatum strains worldwide. However,
   to date, there have been no studies examining their accumulation in
   shellfish. In this study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were
   exposed to G. catenatum for five days and then exposed to a non-toxic
   diet for 24 h, to investigate the toxin's accumulation/elimination
   dynamics. As determined by UHPLC-HILIC-MS/MS, the hydroxybenzoate
   analogues, GC1 to GC6, comprised 41\% of the algae toxin profile and
   only 9\% in mussels. Elimination of GC toxins after 24 h was not
   evident. This study highlights that a relevant fraction of PST in
   mussels are not routinely analysed in monitoring programs and that there
   is a need to better understand the toxicological potential of the
   hydroxybenzoate analogues, in order to properly address the risk of G.

Abstract = {Hemocytes mediate a series of immune reactions essential for bivalve
   survival in the environment, however, the impact of harmful algal
   species and their associated phycotoxins upon bivalve immune system is
   under debate. To better understand the possible toxic effects of these
   toxins, Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to brevetoxin (PbTx-2).
   Hemocyte viability, monitored through the neutral red retention and MTT
   reduction assays, and apoptosis (Hoechst staining) remained unchanged
   during 12 h of exposure to PbTx-2 in concentrations up to 1000 mu g/L.
   Despite cell viability and apoptosis remained stable, hemocytes
   incubated for 4 h with 1000 mu g/L of PbTx-2 revealed higher expression
   levels of Hsp70 (p < 0.01) and CYP356A1 (p < 0.05) transcripts and a
   tendency to increase FABP expression, as evaluated by Real-Time
   quantitative PCR. The expression of other studied genes (BPI, IL-17,
   GSTO, EcSOD, Prx6, SOD and GPx) remained unchanged. The results suggest
   that the absence of cytotoxic effects of PbTx-2 in Crassostrea gigas
   hemocytes, even at high concentrations, allow early defense responses to
   be produced by activating protective mechanisms associated to
   detoxification (CYP356A1 and possibly FABP) and stress (Hsp70), but not
   to immune or to antioxidant (BPI, IL-17, EcSOD, Prx6, GPx and SOD)

Title = {Induction of domoic acid production in diatoms-Types of grazers and

Abstract = {Grazers can induce toxin (domoic acid, DA) production in diatoms. The
   toxic response has been observed in two species of Pseudo-nitzschia and
   was induced by Calanus copepods. In this study, interactions between
   diatoms and copepods were further explored using different species of
   diatoms and copepods. All herbivorous copepods induced toxin production,
   whereas exposure to carnivorous copepods did not. In line with this,
   increasing the number of herbivorous copepods resulted in even higher
   toxin production. The induced response is thus only elicited by copepods
   that pose a real threat to the responding cells, which supports that the
   induced toxin production in diatoms evolved as an inducible defense.
   The cellular toxin content in Pseudo-nitzschia was positively correlated
   to the concentration of a group of specific polar lipids called
   copepodamides that are excreted by the copepods. This suggests that
   copepodamides are the chemical cues responsible for triggering the toxin
   production. Carnivorous copepods were found to produce less or no
   copepodamides.
   Among the diatoms exposed to grazing herbivorous copepods, only two of
   six species of Pseudo-nitzschia and none of the Nitzschia or
   Fragilariopsis strains responded by producing DA, indicating that not
   all Pseudo-nitzschia species/strains are able to produce DA, and that
   different diatom species might have different strategies for coping with
   grazing pressure. Growth rate was negatively correlated to cellular
   domoic acid content indicating an allocation cost associated with toxin
   production. Long-term grazing experiments showed higher mortality rates
   of grazers fed toxic diatoms, supporting the hypothesis that DA
   production is an induced defense mechanism.},

Abstract = {Blooms of the brevetoxin-producing dinoflagellate Karenia brevis have
   been linked to high mortality of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus
   on Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. A clear understanding of trophic
   transfer of brevetoxin from its algal source up the food web to top
   predators is needed to assess exposure of affected dolphin populations.
   Prey fish constitute a means Of accumulating and transferring
   brevetoxins and are potential vectors of brevetoxin to dolphins
   frequently exposed to K. brevis blooms. Here we report. results of
   brevetoxin analyses of the primary fish species consumed by long-term
   resident bottlenose dolphins inhabiting Sarasota Bay, Florida. Fish
   collected during K. brevis blooms in 2003 to 2006 were analyzed by
   competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and had brevetoxin
   concentrations ranging from 4 to 10 844 ng PbTx-3 eq g(-1) tissue.
   Receptor binding assay (RBA) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS) analysis confirmed toxicity and the presence of parent
   brevetoxins and known metabolites. Fish collected in the absence of K.
   brevis blooms tested positive for brevetoxin by ELISA and RBA, with
   concentrations up to 1500 ng PbTx-3 eq g-1 tissue. These findings
   implicate prey fish exposed to K. brevis blooms as brevetoxin vectors
   for their dolphin predators and provide a critical analysis of
   persistent brevetoxin loads in the food web of dolphins repeatedly
   exposed to Florida red tides.},

Abstract = {Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins constitute a severe economic
   threat to shellfish industries and a major food safety issue for
   shellfish consumers. The prime producers of the DSP toxins that end up
   in filter feeding shellfish are species of the marine mixotrophic
   dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis. Intraspecific toxin contents of
   Dinophysis spp. vary a lot, but the regulating factors of toxin content
   are still poorly understood. Dinophysis spp. have been shown to
   sequester and use chloroplasts from their ciliate prey, and with this
   rare mode of nutrition, irradiance and food availability could play a
   key role in the regulation of toxins contents and production. We
   investigated toxin contents, production and excretion of a Dinophysis
   acuta culture under different irradiances, food availabilities and
   growth phases. The newly isolated strain of D. acuta contained okadaic
   acid (OA), pectenotoxins-2 (PTX-2) and a novel dinophysistoxin (DTX)
   that we tentatively describe as DTX-1b isomer. We found that all three
   toxins were excreted to the surrounding seawater, and for OA and DTX-1b
   as much as 90\% could be found in extracellular toxin pools. For PTX-2
   somewhat less was excreted, but often >50\% was found extracellularly.
   This was the case both in steady-state exponential growth and in food
   limited, stationary growth, and we emphasize the need to include
   extracellular toxins in future studies of DSP toxins. Cellular toxin
   contents were largely unaffected by irradiance, but toxins accumulated
   both intra- and extracellularly when starvation reduced growth rates of
   D. acuta. Toxin production rates were highest during exponential growth,
   but continued at decreased rates when cell division ceased, indicating
   that toxin production is not directly associated with ingestion of prey.
   Finally, we explore the potential of these new discoveries to shed light
   on the ecological role of DSP toxins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the Gulf of Mexico are
   frequently exposed to blooms of the toxic alga, Karenia brevis, and
   brevetoxins associated with these blooms have been implicated in several
   dolphin mortality events. Studies on brevetoxin accumulation in dolphins
   have typically focused on analyses of carcasses from large-scale
   die-offs; however, data are scarce for brevetoxin loads in live
   individuals frequently exposed to K. brevis blooms. This study
   investigated in vivo brevetoxin exposure in free-ranging bottlenose
   dolphins resident to Sarasota Bay, Florida, utilizing samples collected
   during health assessments performed during multiple K. brevis blooms
   occurring from 2003 to 2005. Brevetoxins were detected by ELISA and
   LC-MS in 63\% of bottlenose dolphins sampled (n = 30) concurrently with
   a K. brevis bloom. Brevetoxins were present in urine and gastric samples
   at concentrations ranging from 2 to 9 ng PbTx-3 eq/g, and in feces at
   concentrations ranging from 45 to 231 ng PbTx-3 eq/g. Samples from
   individuals (n= 12) sampled during nonbloom conditions (<= 1,000
   cells/L) were negative for brevetoxin activity. Brevetoxin accumulation
   data from this study complement dolphin carcass and prey fish data from
   the same study area, and aid in evaluating impacts of harmful algal
   blooms on sentinel marine animal species along the west Florida coast.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxins are cyclic polyether neurotoxins produced by the marine
   dinoflagellate Ptychodiscus brevis. Blooms of P. brevis (red tides) are
   toxic to fish, marine mammals, and humans. Humans exposed to seaspray
   aerosols containing brevetoxins may experience respiratory tract
   irritation. Because a major route of human exposure to brevetoxins is
   via the respiratory trace, the objective of this study was to examine
   the toxicokinetics of brevetoxin 3 (PbTx-3) administered to the lung by
   intratracheal instillation. Twenty-one male F344/CrI BR rats, 12 wk of
   age, were administered H-3-PbTx-3 (1 mu Ci, 6.6 mu g PbTx-3/kg) by
   intratracheal instillation. Groups of 3 rats were sacrificed at 0.5, 3,
   6, 24, 48, and 96 h after exposure, and tissues were collected. Three
   additional rats were placed in glass metabolism cages for collection of
   urine and feces over a 7-d period. PbTx-3-associated activity was
   cleared rapidly from the lung and distributed throughout the body,
   chiefly to the carcass, intestines, and liver. Blood, brain, and fat
   contained the lowest percentages of the administered dose. Although a
   majority of the PbTx-3 was cleared rapidly from lung, liver, and
   kidneys, approximately 20\% of the initial concentration present in each
   organ was retained for 7 d. Concentrations of PbTx-3 in brain and fat
   were low, but remained relatively constant over time. Approximately
   twice as much PbTx-3-associated activity was excreted in feces than in
   urine, with the majority of excretion occurring within 48 h after
   instillation. The results of this study indicate that over 80\% of the
   PbTx-3 is rapidly absorbed from the lung to the blood and distributed to
   all tissues. The tissues containing the greatest amount of
   PbTx-3-associated activity reflect the compound's site of deposition,
   storage compartment, and major route of metabolism and excretion. These
   results illustrate that brevetoxin exposure by the respiratory route
   results in systemic distribution of brevetoxin and suggest that the
   initial respiratory irritation and bronchoconstriction may only be a
   part of the overall toxicological consequences associated with
   brevetoxin inhalation.},

Title = {Low contamination and rapid depuration of domoic acid in the variegated
   scallop, Mimachlamys varia},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {216},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are natural proliferations of microalgal
   species, able to produce toxic compounds, such as domoic acid (DA), a
   neurotoxin responsible for the Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) which
   can be lethal for mammals. Pectinid species are of high economic value
   and are particularly vulnerable to these events. As filter-feeders, they
   can accumulate DA and transfer it through the food web. However, DA
   retention (accumulation and depuration) varies between species, meaning
   that not all fisheries are equally affected. Therefore, there is a need
   to better understand species-specific DA dynamics in order to
   effectively manage fisheries and mitigate economic impacts. Variegated
   scallops, Mimachlamys varia, have low DA levels compared to king
   scallops, Pecten maximus, although both occur in similar locations.
   However, there is a lack of knowledge on DA retention in M. varia,
   partly due to the difficulty of monitoring field-level individual
   contamination, and obtaining large volumes of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia
   species under laboratory conditions. This study summarises the
   information available from French monitoring networks for DA
   contamination in M. varia and investigates DA accumulation and
   depuration by experimental exposure. The in-situ monitoring revealed
   that M. varia can accumulate DA, but at lower concentrations than other
   bivalves at similar locations and times. The experimental exposure
   induced contamination and we estimated a high depuration rate of 3.3 d-1
   for the digestive gland. These findings have implications for fisheries
   management and suggest that M. varia may be less susceptible to domoic
   acid-related effects than other pectinid species and could be an
   alternative resource.},

Abstract = {The biotoxin okadaic acid (OA), produced by dinoflagellates in marine
   environment, can accumulate in sponges and shellfish. Consumption of
   contaminated shellfish induces acute toxic effects such as diarrhea,
   nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. CYP3A4, one of the most important
   human xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, is supposed to be involved in the
   metabolism of OA. Aim of our study was to evaluate the role of CYP3A4 in
   OA in vitro metabolism as well as in cell cytotoxicity in parallel.
   Therefore, a metabolic competent HepaRG cell line was exposed to OA with
   and without addition of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Without the
   inhibitor, two mono-hydroxylated metabolites could be identified,
   whereas in its presence, no metabolites could be detected. Confirmation
   of the formed metabolites was accomplished by measuring the exact masses
   and investigating the fragmentation pattern. Data obtained from
   cytotoxicity assays showed that OA cytotoxicity is reduced when CYP3A4
   is active. Thus, hydroxylation appears to be a crucial step for
   metabolic OA detoxification.},

Abstract = {As part of our investigation of the metabolism of brevetoxin (PbTx) in
   fish, we initiated a two-part study to determine the toxin's tissue
   distribution and its ability to induce xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.
   In the first study, gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) were administered
   C-14-PbTx-3 orally in a fishmeal slurry and sacrificed 72 hr later.
   Radioactivity was greatest in the hepatobiliary system (40\% of body
   burden), representing the key role this system plays in the
   detoxification and elimination of brevetoxin. Muscle tissue contained
   27\%, followed by gastrointestinal tract (25\%). To investigate the
   effects of PbTx on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, immature redfish
   (Scianops ocellatus) were given two doses of brevetoxin (1.5 or 2.5 mu
   g/100 g body weight) or cod liver oil in a fishmeal slurry by gavage.
   The activities of two hepatic P450 enzymes, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase
   (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase (PROD), as well as the
   cytosolic enzyme, glutathione S-transferase (GST), were measured. At the
   higher dose, PbTx significantly increased EROD activity. These results
   suggest that brevetoxin is capable of inducing an important xenobiotic
   metabolizing enzyme (EROD).},

Abstract = {A bloom of Karenia brevis Davis developed in September 2007 near
   Jacksonville, Florida and subsequently progressed south through east
   Florida coastal waters and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW).
   Maximum cell abundances exceeded 10(6) cells L-1 through October in the
   northern ICW between Jacksonville and the Indian River Lagoon. The bloom
   progressed further south during November, and terminated in December
   2007 at densities of 10(4) cells L-1 in the ICW south of Jupiter Inlet,
   Florida. Brevetoxins were subsequently sampled in sediments and seagrass
   epiphytes in July and August 2008 in the ICW. Sediment brevetoxins
   occurred at concentrations of 11-15 ng PbTx-3 equivalents (g dry wt
   sediment)(-1) in three of five basins in the northern ICW during summer
   2008. Seagrass beds occur south of the Mosquito Lagoon in the ICW.
   Brevetoxins were detected in six of the nine seagrass beds sampled
   between the Mosquito Lagoon and Jupiter Inlet at concentrations of 6-18
   ng (g dry wt epiphytes)(-1). The highest brevetoxins concentrations were
   found in sediments near Patrick Air Force Base at 89 ng (g dry wt
   sediment)(-1). In general, brevetoxins occurred in either seagrass
   epiphytes or sediments. Blades of the resident seagrass species have a
   maximum life span of less than six months, so it is postulated that
   brevetoxins could be transferred between epibenthic communities of
   individual blades in seagrass beds. The occurrence of brevetoxins in
   east Florida coast sediments and seagrass epiphytes up to eight months
   after bloom termination supports observations from the Florida west
   coast that brevetoxins can persist in marine ecosystems in the absence
   of sustained blooms. Furthermore, our observations show that brevetoxins
   can persist in sediments where seagrass communities are absent. (C) 2011

Abstract = {The dinoflagellate Dinophysis spp. is responsible for diarrhetic
   shellfish poisoning (DSP). In the bivalves exposed to the toxic bloom of
   the dinoflagellate, dinophysistoxin 3 (DTX3), the 7-OH acylated form of
   either okadaic acid (OA) or DTX1, is produced. We demonstrated in vitro
   acylation of OA with palmitoyl CoA in the presence of protein extract
   from the digestive gland, but not other tissues of the bivalve
   Mizuhopecten yessoensis. The yield of 7-O-palmitoyl OA reached its
   maximum within 2 h, was the highest at 37 degrees C followed by 28
   degrees C, 16 degrees C and 4 C and was the highest at pH 8 in
   comparison with the yields at pH 6 and pH 4. The transformation also
   proceeded when the protein extract was prepared from the bivalves
   Corbicula japonica and Crassostrea gigas. The OA binding protein OABP2
   identified in the sponge Halichondria okadai was not detected in the
   bivalve M. yessoensis, the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis and the
   ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, though they are known to accumulate
   diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins. Since DTX3 does not bind to
   protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, the physiological target for OA and DTXs
   in mammalian cells, the acylation of DSP toxins would be related to a
   detoxification mechanism for the bivalve species.},

Title = {Optimization of blood collection card method/enzyme-linked immunoassay
   for monitoring exposure of bottlenose dolphin to brevetoxin-producing

Abstract = {Blood collection cards have been successfully used as a tool to monitor
   brevetoxin (PbTx) exposure in several species, including fish, mice, and
   rats. Previous methanolic methods used for extracting brevetoxin from
   blood collection cards have shown dolphin blood to have matrix
   difficulties in several biological assays. To better biomonitor
   protected marine mammal species in the Florida area, which is
   historically prone to unusual mortality events caused by brevetoxin
   exposure, we have modified the previous extraction method to
   consistently recover brevetoxin with a known efficiency from dolphin
   blood collection card samples with minimal matrix interference. A
   combination of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 6\% MeOH and 100\%
   acetonitrile was used to elute blood from the cellulose card and
   precipitate proteins, respectively. Analysis was performed using a newly
   developed direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), which yields a
   sample limit of quantification of 1 ng PbTx-3 equiv/mL. This extraction
   method allowed for linear recovery of PbTx-3 spiked into dolphin blood
   (1-30 ng/mL) with a consistent recovery rate of 58\% and has
   subsequently been used to monitor brevetoxins in dolphins, as well as
   sea turtles and manatees, in regions endemic to red tides. In addition,
   two known metabolites of PbTx-2 were isolated and also found to be
   detectable using the ELISA. The cysteine conjugate (m/z 1018) and
   cysteine sulfoxide conjugate (m/z 1034) were found to have linear
   recoveries of 87\% and 66\%, respectively. In summary, this method of
   extracting brevetoxins and their metabolites from blood collection
   cards, in conjunction with the ELISA detection method, is a simple and
   reliable way to biomonitor physiologically relevant toxin levels in
   protected marine animals.},

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTX) are polyether neurotoxins that target voltage-gated
   sodium channels and are responsible for ciguatera, the most common
   fish-borne food poisoning in humans. This study characterizes the global
   transcriptional response of mouse liver to a symptomatic dose (0.26
   ng/g) of the highly potent Pacific ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1). At 1 h
   post-exposure 2.4\% of features on a 44K whole genome array were
   differentially expressed (p <= 0.0001), increasing to 5.2\% at 4 h and
   decreasing to 1.4\% by 24 h post-CTX exposure. Data were filtered
   (vertical bar fold change vertical bar >= 1.5 and p <= 0.0001 in at
   least one time point) and a trend set of 1550 genes were used for
   further analysis. Early gene expression was likely influenced
   prominently by an acute 4 degrees C decline in core body temperature by
   1 h, which resolved by 8 h following exposure. An initial downregulation
   of 32 different solute carriers, many involved in sodium transport, was
   observed. Differential gene expression in pathways involving eicosanoid
   biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis was also noted. Cytochrome
   P450s (Cyps) were of particular interest due to their role in xenobiotic
   metabolism. Twenty-seven genes, mostly members of Cyp2 and Cyp4
   families, showed significant changes in expression. Many Cyps underwent
   an initial downregulation at 1 h but were quickly and strongly
   upregulated at 4 and 24 h post-exposure. In addition to Cyps, increases
   in several glutathione S-transferases were observed, an indication that
   both phase I and phase II metabolic reactions are involved in the
   hepatic response to CTX in mice.},

Title = {Inter-species variability of okadaic acid group toxicity in relation to

Abstract = {Okadaic acid group (OA-group) is a set of lipophilic toxins which are
   characterised by being produced by species associated with the genera
   Dinophysis and Prorocentrum. OA-group has been regularly detected in
   endemic shellfish species from the southern zone of Chile only through
   the mouse bioassay. The purpose of this work was to determine the
   variability of OA-group toxins in endemic aquatic organisms (bivalves,
   crabs, gastropods and fish) and to establish the relationship with the
   concentration of fatty acids (FAs) detected in the evaluated species.
   The toxicity of OA-group and the FA profiles were determined using
   LC-MS/MS and gas chromatography with flame-ionisation detection,
   respectively. In the study area, the dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta was
   detected in densities approximate to 2000 cells ml(-1) with a toxicity
   approximate to 18.3pg OA equiv cel(-1). The analysis identified OA and
   dinophysistoxin-1 in shellfish in a range of approximate to 90 to
   approximate to 225g OA eq kg(-1), where no toxins in fish were detected.
   A positive relationship between the FA level and the concentration of
   OA-group toxins in the digestive glands of bivalves and gastropods was
   established, noted for high levels of saturated FAs (C14:0 and C16:0).
   The toxic variability of OA-group toxins determined in the different
   species allowed us to establish that the consumption of these vectors,
   regulated by non-analytical methods, can be harmful when consumed by
   humans, thus suggesting that the sanitary regulations for the control of
   OA-group in Chile should be updated.},

Abstract = {juvenile king scallops Pecten maximus of 1.23 cm shell height were
   exposed to domoic acid (DA) and the toxin accumulation and effects of
   bearing this toxin were investigated. After feeding on a formulated feed
   containing about 0.19 pg DA per particle for 7 days, the juvenile
   scallops incorporated a relatively low DA burden of 15.9 ng g(-1), which
   was similar to those exposed to 10 and 50 ng ml(-1) dissolved DA. The
   maximum DA accumulation, 302.5 ng g(-1) whole tissue, was achieved by
   scallops maintained in 100 ng ml(-1) dissolved DA for 18 days. No
   significant effect of exposure to DA was observed on feeding rate (on
   microalgae), shell valve activity (shell clatter), righting response, or
   the secretion of byssus threads. However, negative impacts on growth
   rate and survival were found for scallops exposed to DA-spiked feed.
   This is the first study on DA accumulation in juvenile P. maximus and on
   the negative effect of DA on this life history stage. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Distribution and selective elimination of paralytic shellfish toxins in

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Octopus (Octopus vulgaris, Cuvier) plays a central role in the marine
   food web, being an important consumer with high metabolic rates and at
   the same time an important food item for higher predators. After harmful
   algal blooms, octopus can accumulate high levels of marine toxins trough
   trophic interrelationships. The aim of this study is to characterize the
   distribution of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in selected tissues of
   the O. vulgaris, in order to assess the translocation of toxins among
   organs with different physiological functions. Different retention times
   and selective elimination of particular toxin analogues were also
   investigated. Twenty three specimens of O. vulgaris were captured in
   Peniche (NW coast of Portugal) after PSTs have been detected in
   molluscan bivalves. Tissue matrices were dissected from organs with
   digestive function (digestive gland, stomach and salivary glands) and
   excretory function (kidneys and branchial hearts) and analyzed for toxin
   determination. Toxin analysis was carried out by high performance liquid
   chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD). PSTs were found in
   all tissues analyzed. The highest toxin concentrations were found in the
   digestive gland, reaching a maximum of 2980 mu g SIX equiv. kg(-1). The
   toxin profile was constituted by dcSTX, B1, Cl + 2, dcGTX2 + 3, dcNEO,
   SIX and GTX2 + 3. A lower number of toxins were identified in the
   remaining organs, with B1 and dcSTX compromising more than 90\% in molar
   fraction. Decarbamoyl saxitoxin was the most abundant toxin detected in
   digestive gland, stomach and salivary glands, while B1 was dominant in
   organs with excretory function. A positive correlation of concentrations
   of B1 and dcSTX were found in the organs analyzed. Results indicate that
   B1 and dcSTX are assimilated into the digestive gland in a similar
   proportion. Selective elimination of toxins with higher elimination of
   B1 and retention of dcSTX is suggested. This study contributes to better
   understanding of the dynamics of PSTs in O. vulgaris and the fate of
   PSTs in the food web. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) face a variety of threats,
   including risk of exposure to brevetoxins produced by blooms of the
   harmful alga Karenia brevis. This study investigated brevetoxin exposure
   in a population of dolphins inhabiting Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA (27
   degrees N, 82 degrees W), utilizing tissues from dolphins recovered
   between 1994 and 2003. Brevetoxin levels detected by ELISA in tissues,
   gastric samples and excreta from dolphin carcasses (n = 19) associated
   with K. brevis blooms were compared with with levels in carcasses (n =
   16) associated with background K. brevis conditions. In the K.
   brevis-exposed set, 84\% of dolphin carcasses recovered during K. brevis
   blooms had detectable brevetoxin levels, with values ranging between 7
   and 2,896 ng PbTx-3 eq g(-1). Over 50\% of dolphin carcasses recovered
   during non-bloom conditions also tested positive by ELISA for
   brevetoxins, with concentrations ranging from 6 to 44 ng PbTx-3 eq
   g(-1). Control samples from the east coast of Florida were negative by
   the ELISA. Results from this study establish baseline brevetoxin body
   burdens in a dolphin population frequently exposed to K. brevis blooms,
   and data indicate that dolphin carcasses not associated with large-scale
   mortality events can contain levels of brevetoxins comparable to
   carcasses stranding during such events.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxins are a family of potent lipid-soluble neurotoxins produced by
   the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, the organism responsible for Florida
   red tide. Brevetoxins aerosolized by surf and wind produce irritation of
   the eyes, nose, and throat in people on or near red tide-affected
   beaches. The effects of chronic exposures to brevetoxins on healthy and
   health-compromised individuals are not known. The purpose of this study
   was to investigate the pulmonary uptake, tissue distribution, and
   excretion of polyether brevetoxin-3 in mice, a rodent model for
   investigating the potential systemic adverse health effects associated
   with repeated brevetoxin inhalation. Male CBA/CaJ mice were administered
   {[}H-3] brevetoxin-3 by intratracheal instillation. Groups of 3 mice
   were sacrificed immediately after instillation and at 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 24,
   48, and 96 h postinstillation. Four additional mice were placed into
   metabolism cages for excreta collection up to 168 h postinstillation.
   Brevetoxin-3 distributed rapidly to all tissues, with the highest
   initial doses in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Elimination
   half-times ranged from approximately 28 h for fat, heart, intestines,
   kidneys, liver, and muscle to approximately 90 h for brain and testes.
   The total dose to tissue ranged from 39 ng brevetoxin equivalents-h/g
   for testes to 406 ng brevetoxin equivalents-h/g for liver. Approximately
   90\% of excretion had occurred within 96 h, with 11 and 64\% of the
   initial brevetoxin dose excreted in urine and feces, respectively. These
   results are consistent with earlier reports of rapid absorption and
   widespread tissue distribution of brevetoxins in rats.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of domoic acid (DA), the biotoxin responsible for amnesic
   shellfish poisoning (ASP), exceeding the regulatory limit of 20 mu g
   g(-1) have caused restricted harvesting and closures of wild king
   scallop fisheries. Toxin monitoring programmes have reported significant
   inter-animal variation in DA concentration between scallops from the
   same area. For the development of reliable sampling and management
   protocols an understanding of the magnitude and causes of inter-animal
   variation in toxin concentration are important. Ten samples were
   collected from an aquaculture site in Clew Bay, Co. Mayo off the west
   coast of Ireland between February 2003 and February 2004, each sample
   comprising 12 scallops of each of the following size groups: small
   (70-85 mm), medium (85-100 mm), large (100-115 mm) and very large (> 115
   mm). DA concentration in each hepatopancreas and in composite samples of
   both gonad and adductor muscle from each size group on each sampling
   occasion were measured. High inter-animal variability in DA
   concentration in hepatopancreas was recorded; CVs ranging from 12.5\% to
   82.5\%. One negative correlation (R-2 = 0.7079) between DA concentration
   in hepatopancreas and scallop shell length, three positive but weak
   correlations (R-2 = 0.4536, 0.3459 and 0.4665) and six no correlations
   were exhibited. Negative correlations were attributed to faster DA
   uptake by smaller scallops, positive correlations to faster DA
   depuration by smaller scallops. If only scallops greater than or equal
   to 100 mm shell length, the minimum commercial size of this species were
   considered, no correlation occurred on any of the 10 sampling occasions.

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin naturally produced by some
   pennate diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. It is well known
   that during harmful algal blooms fish can accumulate DA in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract and act as vectors of the toxin to higher
   trophic level piscivores, often with severe neurotoxic consequences to
   the predators. Although neurotoxicity and mass mortality have been
   observed in vertebrates (i.e. marine mammals and sea birds) feeding on
   contaminated fish, to date there has been no evidence of neurobehavioral
   toxicity in the fish vectors themselves. It has been hypothesized that
   fish may not absorb DA from the digestive tract, thus making them
   insensitive to dietary consumption of DA. To test this hypothesis, we
   performed oral gavage exposures followed by a time series of tissue
   dissections to characterize uptake, depuration, and tissue distribution
   of DA in fish. Intracoelomic (IC) injection exposures (which bypass the
   GI tract) were also performed to determine if coho neurons are
   neurologically susceptible to DA. Excitotoxic symptoms were observed in
   fish via IC injection at similar toxin levels that have been reported to
   induce excitotoxic symptoms in intraperitoneal (IP) exposures with
   mammalian models such as mice, suggesting that fish neurons have a
   similar sensitivity to DA as other vertebrates. Surprisingly, after oral
   gavage with ecologically relevant doses of DA, the toxin was detected in
   plasma collected from the dorsal aorta via a permanent intraarterial
   catheter within 15 min, yet excitotoxic symptoms were not observed.
   Additionally, DA was detected in liver, heart, spleen, kidney, muscle,
   brain and bile. These data indicate that although DA is absorbed from
   the gut, fish do not exhibit neuroexcitatory effects at maximum
   ecologically relevant oral doses of DA. Tissue distribution and DA
   uptake and depuration patterns suggest that a majority of the absorbed
   toxin is excreted via the kidneys and bile, thereby preventing toxic
   levels of DA from reaching sensitive nervous tissue. Additionally,
   greater than 20\% of total IC administered DA doses were sequestered in
   bile within I h of injection in five symptomatic fish, providing
   evidence for biliary sequestration of the toxin from blood. Here, we
   comprehensively describe the uptake, depuration, and tissue distribution
   patterns of DA and propose that renal and biliary processes may serve as
   primary routes of toxin clearance in fish. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) can cause deleterious effects in
   marine organisms, threatening the stability of marine ecosystems. It is
   well known that different strains, natural populations and growth
   conditions of the same toxic algal species may lead to different amount
   of phycotoxin production and the ensuing toxicity. To fully assess the
   ecological risk of toxic HABs, it is of great importance to investigate
   the toxic effects of phycotoxins in marine organisms. In this study, the
   short-term toxicity of 14 common phycotoxins (alone and in combination)
   in the marine zooplankton Artemia salina was investigated. The 48 h LC50
   of the 14 phycotoxins varied from 0.019 3 mu g/mL to 2.415 mu g/mL. The
   most potent phycotoxin was azaspiracids-3 (AZA3; with a LC50 of 0.019 3
   mu g/mL), followed by azaspiracids-2 (AZA2; 0.022 6 mu g/mL),
   pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2; 0.046 0 mu g/mL) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1;
   0.081 8 mu g/mL). For the binary exposure, okadaic acid (OA) induced
   potential additive effects with DTX1, probably due to their similar
   structure (polyether fatty acid) and mode of action (attacking the
   serine/threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases). On the other hand, OA
   showed potential antagonistic effects with PTX2, which might be
   accounted for by their activation on the detoxification activity of
   cytochrome P450 activity. In addition, DTX1 induced potential synergetic
   effects with saxitoxin (STX), yessotoxin (YTX) or PTX2, suggesting the
   hazard potency of the mixtures of DTX1 and other phycotoxins (like STX,
   YTX and PTX2) with regard to the ecological risk. These results provide
   valuable toxicological data for assessing the impact of phycotoxins on
   marine planktonic species and highlight the potential ecological risk of
   toxic HABs in marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA), produced by dinoflagellates during harmful algal
   blooms, is a principal diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxin. This toxin
   poses a potential threat to bivalves with economic values. To better
   understand the toxicity mechanism of OA to bivalves, in this study,
   oxidative stress biomarkers (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT;
   glutathione S-transferase, GST; malondialdehyde, MDA) and the expression
   of detoxification genes (heat shock protein 70, HSP70; heat shock
   protein 90, HSP90; cytochrome P450, CYP450) were assessed in the gills
   of scallops Chlamys farreri after 24 h, 48 h and 96 h exposure to OA. In
   addition, the digestive glands of scallops exposed to OA for 96 h were
   dissected for an iTRAQ based quantitative proteomic analysis. The
   results of OA exposure experiments showed that OA induces oxidative
   stress and significant enhancement of the expression of detoxification
   genes in scallops. The proteomics analysis revealed that 159 proteins
   altered remarkably in OA-treated scallops, and these proteins were
   involved in phagosomes, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, adherens
   junction, tight junction, and focal adhesion. Amino acid biosynthesis,
   carbon metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, fructose and mannose
   metabolism in the digestive glands were also significantly impacted. Our
   data shed new insights on the molecular responses and toxicity
   mechanisms of C. farreri to OA.},

Abstract = {The diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia (Peragallo) associated with the
   production of domoic acid (DA), the toxin reposnsible for amnesic
   shellfish poisoning, is abundant in Scottish waters. A two year study
   examined the relationship between Pseudo-nitzschia cells in the water
   column and DA concentration in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at two
   sites, and king scallops (Pecten maximus) at one site. The rate of DA
   uptake and depuration differed greatly between the two species with M.
   edulis whole tissue accumulating and depurating 7 mu g g(-1) (now
   expressed as mg kg(-1)) per week. In contrast, it took 12 weeks for DA
   to depurate from P. maximus gonad tissue from a concentration of 68 mu g
   g(-1) (now mg kg(-1)) to <20 mu g g(-1) (now mg kg(-1)). The DA
   depuration rate from P. maximus whole tissue was <5\% per week during
   both years of the study. Correlations between the Pseudo-nitzschia cell
   densities and toxin concentrations were weak to moderate for M. edulis
   and weak for P. maximus. Seasonal diversity on a species level was
   observed within the Pseudo-nitzschia genus at both sites with more DA
   toxicity associated with summer/autumn Pseudo-nitzschia blooms when P.
   australis was observed in phytoplankton samples. This study reveals the
   marked difference in DA uptake and depuration in two shellfish species
   of commercial importance in Scotland. The use of these shellfish species
   to act as a proxy for DA in the environment still requires
   investigation. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The patent marine neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) was detected in razor
   clams and Dungeness crabs on the Pacific Coast of the United States in
   1991, resulting in temporary closures of these fisheries. Closures
   protect the health of human consumers of clams and crabs but impose
   significant economic losses to the communities that are dependent on
   these fisheries. Widespread closures, and in the case of the clams
   long-lasting ones, were necessary risk management strategies because our
   knowledge of DA uptake and movement through the food web is very
   limited. In order to resolve some of these issues and provide health
   managers with better information concerning this toxin, experiments were
   conducted on the accumulation and fate of DA in Dungeness crabs. Such
   information could provide enhanced safety, permit more efficient
   closures, and lessen the economic effect of future outbreaks.
   In the first study, razor clams, containing known concentrations of DA,
   were fed to Dungeness crabs for 5 days to determine the uptake of the
   toxin by the crabs. Twenty-four hours after the crabs ingested an
   initial 960 mu g of toxin, 260 mu g of DA (27\%) was found in the
   hepatopancreas (HP) of the crabs. At the end of 6 days, 68\% (2,850 mu
   g), from an accumulated 4,220 mu g of ingested toxin, was present in the
   HP. DA was never found in the hemolymph or edible muscle of crabs in
   this experiment, but DA was found in the feces, indicating a route of
   depuration.
   The second study examined the depuration of DA by crabs under fed and
   starved conditions. Crabs fed DA-contaminated clams for 4 days achieved
   an average concentration of 69.5 mu g of DA/g of HP. After 7 days, crabs
   that were fed toxin-free clams three times per week showed a 38\%
   reduction in DA concentration, to 43.4 mu g of DA/g, whereas the average
   toxin concentration in the HP of crabs that were starved was reduced by
   only 4\%, to 66.9 mu g of DA/g.
   In the last sampling, taken at 21 days, the concentration of DA in the
   HP of fed crabs decreased by 89\% of the initial DA concentration to 7.6
   mu g of DA/g, but that of the starved crabs decreased by only 57\%, to
   29.7 mu g of DA/g. Differences in mean concentrations between starved
   and fed crabs at 7, 14, and 21 days were significant. Additional
   measurements at 21 days showed the average weight of a starved crab's HP
   was only 53\% of the fed crab's HP (25.7 vs. 48.7g). Although the mean
   weight of the starved crabs (770 g) was greater than that of the fed
   crabs (730 g), the difference was not significant.},

Title = {The amnesic shellfish poisoning toxin, domoic acid: The tattoo of the

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {133},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin produced by diatoms of the genus
   Pseudo-nitzschia and is responsible for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning
   (ASP) in humans. Some fishery resources of high commercial value, such
   as the king scallop Pecten maximus, are frequently exposed to toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and are capable of accumulating high amounts of
   DA, retaining it for months or even a few years. This poses a serious
   threat to public health and a continuous economical risk due to fishing
   closures of this resource in the affected areas. Recently, it was
   hypothesized that trapping of DA within autophagosomic-vesicles could be
   one reason explaining the long retention of the remaining toxin in P.
   maximus digestive gland. To test this idea, we follow the kinetics of
   the subcellular localization of DA in the digestive glands of P. maximus
   during (a) the contamination process - with sequential samplings of
   scallops reared in the field during 234 days and naturally exposed to
   blooms of DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia australis, and (b) the
   decontamination process - where highly contaminated scallops were
   collected after a natural bloom of toxic P. australis and subjected to
   DA-depuration in the laboratory for 60 days. In the digestive gland,
   DA-depuration rate (0.001 day(-1)) was much slower than contamination
   kinetics. The subcellular analyses revealed a direct implication of
   early autophagy in DA sequestration throughout contamination (r = 0.8, P
   < 0.05), while the presence of DA-labeled residual bodies (late
   autophagy) appeared to be strongly and significantly related to slow
   DA-depuration (r = -0.5) resembling an analogous DA-tattooing in the
   digestive glands of P. maximus. This work provides new evidence about
   the potential physiological mechanisms involved in the long retention of
   DA in P. maximus and represents the baseline to explore procedures to
   accelerate decontamination in this species.},

Title = {Physiological conditions favorable to domoic acid production by three
   Pseudo-nitzschia species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {559},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Twenty-six species of the cosmopolitan genus Pseudo-nitzschia can
   produce domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin responsible for amnesic shellfish
   poisoning (ASP). To improve knowledge on this issue, we studied the
   physio-logical conditions favorable to DA production and accumulation by
   three Pseudo-nitzschia species from French coastal waters: P. australis,
   P. pungens, and P. fraudulenta. They were grown in batch cultures under
   silicate limitation to characterize their physiological traits and
   calculate their DA production rates. Three strains were studied per
   species to consider intraspecific diversity and better characterize
   interspecific differences. DA pro-duction was not influenced by growth
   or silicate limitation in any of the three species. In contrast,
   silicate limitation in the stationary phase led to DA accumulation by
   inhibiting cell division, while DA production was still active. The
   maximum cellular DA (cDA) production rate was 2.95 pg cell-1 d-1 for P.
   australis, 0.07 pg cell-1 d-1 for P. pungens, and 0.03 pg cell-1 d-1 for
   P. fraudulenta. The physiological conditions favorable to cDA production
   and accumulation by P. australis and P. pungens differed. The three
   species presented similar growth rates, but P. australis had higher
   photosynthetic capacities that could partly explain its higher DA
   production potential. The cDA production and the net dissolved DA (dDA)
   production in the culture medium were favored by different growth
   conditions. The cDA production to net dDA production ratio was species
   specific, with P. pungens excreting proportionally more of its produced
   DA. These laboratory results on cultures imply that cDA production and
   net dDA production can occur during all phases of P. australis, P.
   pungens, and P. fraudulenta blooms. The interactions between the species
   composition of the bloom, the species-specific capacity for DA
   production, and the effect of silicate limitation - among other factors
   - on DA cell quotas drive the toxigenicity of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms.},

Title = {Depuration of Okadaic acid (Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxin) in mussels,
   Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus), feeding on different quantities of
   nontoxic algae},

Abstract = {Depuration of mussels contaminated by Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST)
   is a potential option for the shellfish industry to manage the impact of
   DST. Field observations have suggested that the main factor regulating
   the rate of deputation of DST is the quantity of nontoxic algae
   available for the mussels to feed upon. In this paper, the effects of
   the quantity of food, which mussels feed upon, on the rate of deputation
   of DST in Mytilus edulis L. was tested in a laboratory experiment.
   Mussels naturally contaminated by the DST okadaic acid (OA) were
   collected from a mussel farm located on the Swedish west coast during a
   bloom event. Individual mussels were placed in filtered seawater and
   given daily rations of a mixture of nontoxic algae as follows: no food,
   0.5\% and 1.5\% of dry weight body mass day(-1). Depuration was
   performed over 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 days. The levels of OA decreased in
   all treatments with time, with an average of approximately 50\%
   reduction after 32 days. No significant differences in content of OA
   among food rations were detected. In contrast to predictions, a trend
   towards lower levels of toxins in the mussels receiving no food compared
   to both food treatments was observed after 32 days of deputation. The
   loss of toxins in mussels that were not feeding correlated with a
   considerable loss in the mass of the digestive gland between 16 and 32
   days. It was concluded that the rate of depuration of OA in mussels is
   not positively correlated with digestive activity and fecal production.
   Instead, the lipophilic character of the OA molecule suggests that OA
   may have affinity for lipid-rich cellular and intracellular components.
   Increased usage of lipid stores, which occur during starvation, may
   accelerate the release of OA. This model could explain the observations
   made during the last part of this experiment. In management of toxic
   mussels, depuration in waters free of toxic algae is not likely to be
   enhanced by increasing the food supply to mussels; however, long periods
   of deputation in the absence of food should be avoided because of the
   negative effects on the condition of the mussels. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {The possibility and effectiveness of microencapsulation of okadaic acid
   (OA) in gelatin-acacia microcapsules has been studied. The encapsulation
   efficiency was higher than 33\%. The microcapsules were shown to be very
   stable, not leaching more than 9\% of the encapsulated OA in a 20-h
   period. OA from the microcapsules was absorbed by the mussels very
   efficiently, accumulating -after 3 days of feeding and one of
   depuration- 65\% of the OA in microcapsules and 22\% of the total OA
   used at the beginning of the microencapsulation process. These
   efficiencies and the possibility of encapsulating single DSP toxins and

   and biotransformation of DSP toxins in bivalves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Azaspiracids are a class of recently discovered algae-derived shellfish
   toxins. Their distribution globally is on the increase with mussels
   being most widely implicated in azaspiracid-related food poisoning
   events. Evidence that these toxins were bound to proteins in
   contaminated mussels has been shown recently. In the present study
   characterization of these proteins in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was
   achieved using a range of advanced proteomics tools. Four proteins
   present only in the hepatopancreas of toxin-contaminated mussels sharing
   identity or homology with cathepsin D, superoxide dismutase, glutathione
   S-transferase Pi, and a bacterial flagellar protein have been
   characterized. Several of the proteins are known to be involved in
   self-defense mechanisms against xenobiotics or up-regulated in the
   presence of carcinogenic agents. These findings would suggest that
   azaspiracids should now be considered and evaluated as potential
   tumorigenic compounds. The presence of a bacterial protein only in
   contaminated mussels was an unexpected finding and requires further
   investigation. The proteins identified in this study should assist with
   development of urgently required processes for the rapid depuration of
   azaspiracid-contaminated shellfish. Moreover they may serve as early
   warning indicators of shellfish exposed to this family of toxins.

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), an excitatory amino acid produced by diatoms belonging
   to the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, is a glutamate analog responsible for the
   neurologic condition referred to as amnesic shellfish poisoning. To
   date, the renal effects of DA have been underappreciated, although renal
   filtration is the primary route of systemic elimination and the kidney
   expresses ionotropic glutamate receptors. To characterize the renal
   effects of DA, we administered either a neurotoxic dose of DA or doses
   below the recognized limit of toxicity to adult Sv128/Black Swiss mice.
   DA preferentially accumulated in the kidney and elicited marked renal
   vascular and tubular damage consistent with acute tubular necrosis,
   apoptosis, and renal tubular cell desquamation, with toxic vacuolization
   and mitochondrial swelling as hallmarks of the cellular damage. Doses >=
   0.1 mg/kg DA elevated the renal injury biomarkers kidney injury
   molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and doses >=
   0.005 mg/kg induced the early response genes c-fos and junb.
   Coadministration of DA with the broad spectrum excitatory amino acid
   antagonist kynurenic acid inhibited induction of c-fos, junb, and
   neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These findings suggest that
   the kidney may be susceptible to excitotoxic agonists, and renal effects
   should be considered when examining glutamate receptor activation.
   Additionally, these results indicate that DA is a potent nephrotoxicant,
   and potential renal toxicity may require consideration when determining
   safe levels for human exposure.},

Abstract = {To reveal the molecular mechanisms triggered by okadaic acid
   (OA)-exposure in the detoxification and immune system of bay scallops,
   we studied differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) and the transcriptomic
   profile in bay scallop gill tissue after 48 h exposure to 500 nM of OA
   using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 deep-sequencing platform. De novo assembly
   of paired-end reads yielded 55,876 unigenes, of which 3204 and 2620
   genes were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated,
   respectively. Gene ontology classification and enrichment analysis of
   the DEGs detected in bay scallops exposed to OA revealed four ontologies
   with particularly high functional enrichment, which were cellular
   process' (cellular component), metabolic process' (biological process),
   immune system process' (biological process), and catalytic process'
   (molecular function). The DEGs revealed that cyclic AMP-responsive
   element-binding proteins, acid phosphatase, toll-like receptors, nuclear
   erythroid 2-related factor, and the NADPH2 quinone reductase-related
   gene were upregulated. In contrast, the expression of some genes related
   to glutathione S-transferase 1, C-type lectin, complement C1q tumor
   necrosis factor-related protein, Superoxide dismutase 2 and fibrinogen C
   domain-containing protein, decreased. The outcomes of this study will be
   a valuable resource for the study of gene expression induced by marine
   toxins, and will help understanding of the molecular mechanisms
   underlying the scallops' response to OA exposure.},

Title = {SEQUESTERING AND PUTATIVE BIOTRANSFORMATION OF PARALYTIC SHELLFISH
   TOXINS BY THE SEA SCALLOP PLACOPECTEN-MAGELLANICUS - SEASONAL AND

Abstract = {The seasonal sequestering and elimination of paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) toxins in various tissue compartments of wild stocks of
   the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus Gmelin were compared for
   inshore (<20 m depth) and offshore (180 m depth) populations from the
   Gulf of Maine. Individual toxin composition and calculated toxicity in
   replicate individuals were determined over a 2-yr period by high
   performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD).
   In spite of considerable seasonal variation, the weight-specific net
   toxicity (mug STX eq . 100 g-1) in each tissue compartment usually
   followed a predictable rank order (digestive gland > mantle much greater
   than gill > gonad much greater than adductor muscle), although mantles
   were briefly more toxic than digestive glands in the fall. Differences
   in toxin composition between scallop populations were not as significant
   as the intra-population seasonal variation. However, the profile of
   residual toxin in different tissues of individual scallops revealed
   differential toxin accumulation. Relatively high toxin levels were found
   in the early spring, particularly in digestive gland tissue (> 200 mug
   STX eq . 100 g-1), suggesting that substantial toxin may have been
   sequestered through the winter. An increase in the
   N-sulfocarbamoyl:carbamate toxin ratio between early spring and the
   previous fall provided circumstantial evidence of new toxin
   accumulation, although this occurred before major blooms of the
   toxigenic dinoflagellate Alexandrium typically occur in the Gulf of
   Maine. The toxin profiles in scallop tissues were found to differ
   substantially from that of a representative PSP toxin-producing
   dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense (GT429) isolated from the Gulf of
   Maine. The major PSP toxins found in scallop tissues were low toxicity
   N-sulfocarbamoyl (C1/C2) derivatives, and highly potent carbamate
   toxins, including gonyautoxins (GTX1-GTX4), neosaxitoxin (NEO) and
   saxitoxin (STX). The alpha-epimers of the C-11 sulfated gonyautoxins and
   N-sulfocarbamoyl derivatives generally predominated in the scallops, in
   contrast to the dinoflagellate, where the beta-epimers were in higher
   proportion. The clearest evidence of toxin biotransformation was in the
   gonads of offshore scallops, where a decrease in the relative amount of
   toxins C1-C4 and NEO in the spring was followed by a major increase in
   GTX2/GTX3 and de novo appearance of STX. The use of toxin ratios in
   scallops as indices of toxin transfer and for retrospective analysis of
   dinoflagellate bloom events were confounded by apparent rapid
   epimerization and by equilibration of the V-sulfocarbamoyl:carbamate
   toxin ratio on a shorter time-scale than the sampling frequency.},

Title = {The algal hepatoxoxin okadaic acid is a substrate for human cytochromes

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {325-332},
Month = {FEB-MAR},
Abstract = {The hepatotoxin okadaic acid (OA) was incubated with nine human
   recombinant cytochrome P450s (1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4
   and 3A5). Both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 converted CA to a mixture of the same
   four metabolites, but incubation with CYP3A4 resulted in higher levels
   of conversion. Michaelis-Menten parameters, K-m (73.4 mu M) and V-max
   (7.23 nmol of metabolites nmol(-1) min(-1)) for CYP3A4 were calculated
   by analyzing double-reciprocal plots. LC-MSn analysis and chemical
   interconversion indicate that metabolites 2 and 3 are the 11S-hydroxy
   and 11R-hydroxy okadaic acid respectively, while metabolite 4 is 11-oxo
   okadaic acid. LC-MSn analysis of metabolite I shows a molecular ion
   which corresponds to an addition of 16 amu to CIA, also suggesting
   hydroxylation, but the specific site has not been identified. The same
   four metabolites were produced upon incubation of okadaic acid with
   pooled human liver microsomes. This transformation could be completely
   inhibited with ketokonazole, and inhibitor of the CYP3A family of
   enzymes. The metabolites were determined to be only slightly less potent
   inhibitors of serine threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) when
   compared to CA. As PP2A is the principle molecular target for OA, these
   oxidative transformations may not effectively detoxify OA. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The marine dinoflagellate G. breve (Ptychodiscus brevis) contains a

   cardiac preparations at 1.25 .times. 10-8-1.87 .times. 10-7. The toxin
   (10-7 M) transiently increased left ventricular +dP/dt {[}change in
   pressure with time], hydraulic work and O2 consumption of paced working
   rat hearts, then reduced these variables during continuous exposure.
   Brevetoxin B exerted a smaller positive inotropic effect on working
   guinea pig hearts, but produced a marked and sustained inotropic effect
   on guinea pig left atria. The toxin also produced arrhythmias in rat and
   guinea pig hearts, characterized by ventricular tachycardia and A-V
   blockade. Sympatholytic procedures (.beta.-blockade or reserpine
   pretreatment) partially blocked the positive inotropic effects, and
   eliminated the ventricular tachycardia, but not the A-V blockade.
   Tetrodotoxin markedly inhibited the positive inotropic effect of GbTX-B.
   Brevetoxin B did not inhibit guinea pig cardiac Na,K-ATPase activities.
   GbTX-B was a potent cardiotoxin and exerted positive inotropic and
   arrhythmogenic effects by increasing sarcolemmal Na permeability and
   release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve endings.},

Title = {Clinical Signs and Pathology Associated With Domoic Acid Toxicosis in
   Southern Sea Otters (Enhydra lutris nereis)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The marine biotoxin domoic acid (DA) is an analog of the
   neurotransmitter glutamate that exerts potent excitatory activity in the
   brain, heart, and other tissues. Produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia
   spp., DA accumulates in marine invertebrates, fish, and sediment.
   Southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) feed primarily on
   invertebrates, including crabs and bivalves, that concentrate and slowly
   depurate DA. Due to their high prey consumption (25\% of body
   weight/day), sea otters are commonly exposed to DA. A total of 823
   necropsied southern sea otters were examined to complete this study;
   first we assessed 560 subadult, adult, and aged adult southern sea
   otters sampled from 1998 through 2012 for DA-associated pathology,
   focusing mainly on the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular
   system. We applied what was learned to an additional cohort of
   necropsied sea otters of all demographics (including fetuses, pups,
   juveniles, and otters examined after 2012: n = 263 additional animals).
   Key findings derived from our initial efforts were consistently observed
   in this more demographically diverse cohort. Finally, we assessed the
   chronicity of DA-associated pathology in the CNS and heart independently
   for 54 adult and aged adult sea otters. Our goals were to compare the
   temporal consistency of DA-associated CNS and cardiovascular lesions and
   determine whether multiple episodes of DA toxicosis could be detected on
   histopathology. Sea otters with acute, fatal DA toxicosis typically
   presented with neurological signs and severe, diffuse congestion and
   multifocal microscopic hemorrhages (microhemorrhages) in the brain,
   spinal cord, cardiovascular system, and eyes. The congestion and
   microhemorrhages were associated with detection of high concentrations
   of DA in postmortem urine or gastrointestinal content and preceded
   histological detection of cellular necrosis or apoptosis. Cases of
   chronic DA toxicosis often presented with cardiovascular pathology that
   was more severe than the CNS pathology; however, the lesions at both
   sites were relatively quiescent, reflecting previous damage. Sea otters
   with fatal subacute DA toxicosis exhibited concurrent CNS and
   cardiovascular pathology that was characterized by progressive lesion
   expansion and host response to DA-associated tissue damage. Acute,
   subacute, and chronic cases had the same lesion distribution in the CNS
   and heart. CNS pathology was common in the hippocampus, olfactory,
   entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, periventricular neuropil, and
   ventricles. The circumventricular organs were identified as important DA
   targets; microscopic examination of the pituitary gland, area postrema,
   other circumventricular organs, and both eyes facilitated confirmation
   of acute DA toxicosis in sea otters. DA-associated histopathology was
   also common in cardiomyocytes and coronary arterioles, especially in the
   left ventricular free wall, papillary muscles, cardiac apex, and atrial
   free walls. Progressive cardiomyocyte loss and arteriosclerosis occurred
   in the same areas, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. The
   temporal stage of DA-associated CNS pathology matched the DA associated
   cardiac pathology in 87\% (n = 47/54) of cases assessed for chronicity,
   suggesting that the same underlying process (e.g., DA toxicosis) was the
   cause of these lesions. This temporally matched pattern is also
   indicative of a single episode of DA toxicosis. The other 13\% of
   examined otters (n = 7/54) exhibited overlapping acute, subacute, or
   chronic DA pathology in the CNS and heart, suggestive of recurrent DA
   toxicosis.
   This is the first rigorous case definition to facilitate diagnosis of DA
   toxicosis in sea otters. Diagnosing this common but often occult
   condition is important for improving clinical care and assessing
   population-level impacts of DA exposure in this federally listed
   threatened subspecies. Because the most likely source of toxin is
   through prey consumption, and because humans, sea otters, and other
   animals consume the same marine foods, our efforts to characterize
   health effects of DA exposure in southern sea otters can provide strong
   collateral benefits.},

   the analyses performed before 2008. On 22 January 2008, domoic acid (DA)
   was detected in Donax trunculus (0.5 mg kg(-1)) and confirmed by rapid
   resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (0.6 mg
   kg(-1)). A total of 974 shellfish samples were analyzed from January
   2008 to December 2011, covering all the Catalan production areas and the
   most important marketed species. DA was detected in 23.8 \% of the
   samples and was recorded every month in all areas and all species,
   except Ostrea edulis, although the percentage of samples with DA and DA
   content varied widely among samples. DA exceeded the regulatory level of
   20 mg kg(-1) twice: in Callista chione sampled on February 2008 and in
   D. trunculus sampled on April 2010. DA content in Bolinus brandaris
   appeared constant and close to 4.5 mg kg(-1) for months in 2009. Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, Crassostrea gigas, and Ruditapes sp. presented very
   low concentrations of DA in the Ebro Delta bays, despite 113 alert
   situations according to Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundances and the high
   number of shellfish samples analyzed. The origin of DA in Catalan
   shellfish remains unknown.},

Title = {Dynamics of ciguatoxins from Gambierdiscus polynesiensis in the

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This study investigates ciguatoxin dynamics in mullet after controlled
   feeding of Gambierdiscus polynesiensis cells as a model to characterize
   the absorption, distribution, retention and accumulation of ciguatoxins
   into the second trophic level of southwestern Pacific coral reef
   ecosystems. Mullet (Mugil cephalus) were fed once every other day over a
   period of 16 days for nine toxic feedings, and ciguatoxin activity was
   assessed over time in blood and seven tissues using the Neuro2a assay.
   Within 3 h of feeding on G. polynesiensis cells, ciguatoxins attained
   maximal blood concentrations, indicating rapid absorption of toxins into
   the systemic circulation. The time course for distribution of the
   estimated total tissue burden of ciguatoxin closely followed the time
   course for blood toxin levels, indicating a rapid distribution of the
   ciguatoxins throughout the fish body. The large majority (95\%) of the
   ciguatoxin ingested dose was eliminated from the examined fish tissues
   24 h after a single toxic meal, indicating little retention potential
   for ciguatoxin. We found no evidence for ciguatoxin accumulation after
   nine repeated feedings spaced two days apart, indicating that mullet did
   not accumulate ciguatoxin. These results provide the first experimental
   evidence supporting the central tenet of Randall's food chain hypothesis
   that ciguatoxins enter the food chain by transfer from unicellular algae
   to herbivorous and detritus-feeding fish. We propose that a
   time-dependent transformation of oxopene ciguatoxins may be necessary
   for the concentration of ciguatoxin through higher trophic levels.

Abstract = {Brevetoxin B (BTX-B), produced by dinoflagellates of the species
   Karenia, is a highly reactive molecule, due in part to an
   alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde group at the terminal side chain,
   leading to the production of metabolites in shellfish by reduction,
   oxidation, and conjugation. We have investigated in mice the blood
   elimination of three common bioactive brevetoxin metabolites found in
   shellfish, which have been semisynthesized from BTX-B in radioactive
   forms. BTX-B was reduced at C42 to yield {[}H-3] dihydro-BTX-B. {[}H-3]
   S-desoxy-BTX-B2 (cysteine brevetoxin B) was semisynthesized from BTX-B
   by the conjugation of cysteine at the C50 olefinic group then {[}H-3]
   radiolabeled by C42 aldehyde reduction. {[}HC]
   N-Palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2 was prepared using S-desoxy-BTX-B2 as the
   starting material with addition of the {[}C-14] radiolabeled fatty acid
   via cysteine amide linkage. The elimination of intravenously
   administered {[}H-3] S-desoxy-BTX-B2, {[}C-14]
   N-palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2, or {[}H-3] dihydroBTX-B was measured in
   blood collected from C57BL/6 mice over a 48 h period. Each brevetwdn
   metabolite tested exhibited biexponential elimination kinetics and fit a
   two-compartment model of elimination that was applied to generate
   toxicokinetic parameters. The rate of transfer between the central
   compartment (i.e., blood) and the peripheral compartment (e.g., tissue)
   for each brevetoxin differed substantially, with dihydro-BTX-B
   exchanging rapidly with the peripheral compartment, S-desoxy-BTX-B2
   eliminating rapidly from the central compartment, and
   N-palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2 eliminating slowly from the central
   compartment. Toxicokinetic parameters were analyzed in the context of
   the unique structure of each brevetoxin metabolite resulting from a
   reduction, amino acid conjugation, or fatty acid addition to BTX-B.},

Booktitle = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER TOXINS},
Series = {Toxinology},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {93-112},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DOM) is a marine toxin found in the red alga Chondria
   armata and produced worldwide by a variety of phytoplankton
   (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) under certain environmental conditions.
   Planktonically derived DOM bioaccumulates in filter-feeding mollusks,
   such as mussels, clams, and oysters, as well as in planktivorous fish
   species, such as anchovies and sardines. These species serve as vectors
   through which humans and a variety of wildlife species become
   intoxicated with DOM. A structural analogue of glutamic acid, DOM is a
   highly potent neurotoxin that produces excitotoxicity both directly and
   indirectly in the central nervous system by a selective activation of
   the kainate receptor subtype of glutamate receptors. In the only
   properly documented case of human toxicity following DOM exposure,
   affected individuals experienced gastrointestinal toxicity as well as
   neurological symptoms including headache, amnesia, seizures, coma, and
   death occurring roughly in a dose-dependent manner. Seizures, neuronal
   necrosis, and death due to DOM have also been well characterized in
   piscivorous birds and mammals, notably California sea lions (Zalophus
   californianus). In experimental animals, DOM is known to penetrate the
   central nervous system poorly and to be eliminated almost exclusively by
   renal excretion. Consequently, conditions of reduced blood-brain
   integrity (fetal/neonatal, acute inflammation) and/or impaired renal
   clearance significantly enhance DOM toxicity in laboratory animals and
   may confer additional risk in certain populations (e.g., diabetics,
   neonates, elderly) although this is not yet established. Currently, the
   only approved therapies for DOM intoxication are anticonvulsant drugs
   and maintenance therapy, although a number of glutamatergic antagonists
   are in preclinical development.},

Abstract = {The molecular pathways behind the toxicity of diarrheic shellfish toxins
   (DSTs) in bivalves have been scarcely studied. Thus, a shotgun
   proteomics approach was applied in this work to understand bivalves'
   molecular responses to the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (1.0 x 10(6)
   cells/L). Protein expression along with toxins levels were analyzed in
   the gills and digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
   during and after exposure to this toxic strain. Results revealed an
   accumulation of OA and DTX1 only in the digestive gland with maximum
   amounts attained at the end of uptake phase (day 5; 2819.2 +/- 522.2 mu
   g OA/kg and 1107.1 +/- 267.9 mu g DTX1/kg). At the end of the depuration
   phase (day 20), 16\% and 47\% of total OA and DTX1 concentrations
   remained in the digestive gland tissues, respectively. The shotgun
   proteomic analyses yielded 3051 proteins in both organs. A total of 56
   and 54 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed in the
   digestive gland and gills, respectively. Both organs presented the same
   response dynamics along the experiment, although with tissue-specific
   features. The early response (3 days uptake) was characterized by a high
   number of DEPs, being more marked in gills, in relation to the latter
   time points (5 days uptake and depuration). Functional enrichment
   analysis revealed the up-regulation of carboxylic (GO:0046943) and
   organic acid transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0005342) pathways
   after 3 days uptake for digestive gland. Matching to these pathways are
   a group of proteins related to transmembrane transport and response to
   toxic substances and xenobiotics, namely P-glycoprotein (ABCB11),
   Sodium-dependent proline transporter (SLC6A7), and Sideroflexin-1
   (SFXN1). According to Clusters of Orthologous Groups (GOs) categories,
   most of the DEPs found for digestive gland in all time-points were
   related with ``cellular processes and signaling{''} and involving signal
   transduction mechanisms, cytoskeleton and post-translational
   modification, protein turnover, chaperone functions. In gills, the early
   uptake phase was marked by a balance between DEPs related with
   ``cellular processes and signaling{''} and ``metabolism.{''} Depuration
   is clearly marked by processes related with ``metabolism,{''} mainly
   involving secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism.

Title = {Dissolved saxitoxin causes transient inhibition of sensorimotor function
   in larval Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi)},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) spawning sites in Puget Sound,
   Washington overlap spatially and temporally with blooms of Alexandrium
   catenella, a toxic dinoflagellate species responsible for paralytic
   shellfish poisoning. Consequently, newly hatched herring larvae may be
   regularly exposed to the suite of dissolved paralytic shellfish toxins
   that are released into the water column from toxic cells during blooms.
   To date, virtually nothing is known about the impacts of these
   neurotoxins on early developmental stages of marine fish. In the present
   study, herring larvae at three ages, 0 days post hatch (dph), 4 dph, and
   11 dph, were exposed to dissolved saxitoxin (STX) in 24-h and multiday
   exposures. All larvae were examined for sensorimotor function (i.e.
   spontaneous swimming behavior and touch response). Significant
   reductions in spontaneous and touch-activated swimming behavior occurred
   within 1 h of exposure. EC(50)s at 1 h of exposure were 1,500, 840, and
   700 mu g STX equiv. l(-1) for larvae introduced to STX at 0, 4, and 11
   dph, respectively. This progressive age-specific increase in STX-induced
   paralysis suggests that older larvae were more sensitive to the toxin
   than younger larvae. Interestingly, herring larvae at all ages exhibited
   a significant degree of neurobehavioral recovery within 4-24 h of
   continuous exposure relative to the 1-h time point. This recovery of
   normal motor behaviors was not observed in previous studies with
   freshwater zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae under the same continuous
   exposure conditions, suggesting that an adaptive detoxification or toxin
   sequestration mechanism may have evolved in some species of marine fish
   larvae. Our data reveal that (1) dissolved STX is bioavailable to marine
   finfish larvae, (2) the toxin is a paralytic agent with potencies that
   differ between developmental stages, and (3) STX-induced sensorimotor
   inhibition occurs rapidly but is transient in marine larvae.
   Collectively, these results suggest that dissolved algal toxins may have
   important sublethal effects on marine fish populations.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a water-soluble marine neurotoxin produced and
   released by certain species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia.
   Present in coastal waters, it can be a threat to public health and
   marine life, and can result in severe economic losses to the molluscan
   shellfish and crustacean harvesting industries. Here we report on the
   efficiency of nanocrystalline (NC) titania (TiO2) thin films used as a
   photocatalyst in the ultraviolet light photodegradation of DA. Titanium
   dioxide thin films produced by a sol-gel dip-coating method in the
   presence of polyethylene glycol of different molecular weights (200, 400
   and 600) were deposited on glass substrates and crystallised at 90
   degrees C. The films were characterised using spectroscopic
   ellipsometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( FTIR), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman
   spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity measurements were carried out
   by immersing the NC TiO2 films in a DA solution (2500 ng ml(-1)) and
   then exposing them for various times at room temperature to UVA
   irradiation (lambda = approximately 350 nm). The degradation of DA,
   quantified by HPLC analysis, was not significant when using daylight or
   ultraviolet light irradiation alone, whereas the NC TiO2 films prepared
   at low temperature proved to be a very efficient photocatalyst when used
   in conjunction with UVA light. The effectiveness of the photodegradation
   was improved by increasing molecular weight of polyethylene glycol,
   which increased the thickness of the film. The presence, transformation
   and degradation of three DA isomers were observed. The approach may
   eventually be practical for destroying DA in seawater used by
   aquaculture industry depuration facilities.},

Abstract = {The role of okadaic acid (OA) in the defense system of the marine
   demosponge Suberites domuncula against symbiotic/parasitic annelids was
   examined. Bacteria within the mesohyl produced okadaic acid at
   concentrations between 32 ng/g and 58 ng/g of tissue (wet weight). By
   immunocytochemical methods and by use of antibodies against OA, we
   showed that the toxin was intracellularly stored in vesicles. Western
   blotting experiments demonstrated that OA also existed bound to a
   protein with a molecular weight of 35,000 which was tentatively
   identified as a galectin (by application of antigalectin antibodies).
   Annelids that are found in S. domuncula undergo apoptotic cell death. OA
   is one candidate inducer molecule of this process, since this toxin
   accumulated in these symbionts/parasites. Furthermore, we identified the
   cDNA encoding the multifunctional prosurvival molecule BAG-1 in S.
   domuncula; it undergoes strong expression in the presence of the
   annelid. Our data suggest that sponges use toxins (here, OA) produced
   from bacteria to eliminate metazoan symbionts/parasites by apoptosis.},

Abstract = {This study reports the accumulation of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
   in Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) over a bloom of the
   toxigenic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. High levels of toxins,
   up to 4800 mu g STXeq kg(-1), were registered at the peak of the bloom
   (5.0 10(3) cells l(-1)). The suite of individual PSTs was examined.
   Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and B1 constituted nearly 90\% of toxins
   (on a molar basis) determined in mackerel. This profile of toxins
   markedly differs from the known profile of toxins produced by G.
   catenatum strains isolated from the Portuguese coast, which is dominated
   by N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins, in particular the C1+2 toxins. The
   prevalence of the potent dcSTX in the pelagic environment and its
   transfer through the marine food web is highlighted in this study.
   Atlantic horse mackerel is identified as a high potential vector of PSTs
   along the Portuguese coast. This fish species has a central position in
   the marine food web, being an important predator of zooplankton and at
   the same time an important diet item of top predators. This study
   reveals bioaccumulation values that are important for evaluating
   potential impacts of blooms of PST-producing dinoflagellates on marine
   ecosystems or their components, such as fish.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) the toxin responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning

   and aquaculture in Ireland. Toxin concentration in hepatopancreas of
   individual scallops and composite samples of gonad and adductor muscle
   of scallops suspended from a submerged longline, 2 in beneath the water
   surface and on a seabed site, 12-15 in beneath the Suspended scallops
   were monitored from February 2003 to February 2004 at an aquaculture
   site in Clew Bay, Ireland. DA concentration in hepatopancreas of
   scallops from the seabed and longline peaked in April 2003. individual
   concentrations reaching 1037.1 mu g.g(-1) and 1212.6 mu g.g(-1)
   respectively. No statistically significant differences were exhibited
   between DA concentration in hepatopancreas of seabed and long-line
   scallops except on 1 of the 10 sampling occasions. Slow depuration of DA
   toxin from hepatopancreas Occurred front April 2003 to June 2003 and the
   concentration remained relatively stable from June 2003 to Feb 2004.
   Interpretation of DA concentrations in gonad were complicated by the
   lower concentrations recorded and the variable size of the gonad caused
   by the reproductive cycle over the 12-month study duration. DA
   concentrations in adductor muscle were below the limit of detection
   throughout the investigation. In summary DA concentration between
   scallops held in suspension or maintained on the seabed exhibited minor
   difference, and routine monitoring samples could be collected annually
   and held in suspended culture systems rather than using more expensive
   diver collection for sample procurement.},

Title = {Association between red tide exposure and detection of corresponding
   neurotoxins in bottlenose dolphins from Texas waters during 2007-2017},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms produced by the phytoplankton species Karenia
   brevis and its associated neurotoxin, brevetoxin (PbTx), occur
   throughout the Gulf of Mexico and have had devastating impacts on
   co-occurring populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), an
   important marine sentinel species. The majority of documented impacts,
   however, are from the eastern Gulf of Mexico, with a critical lack of
   information on the degree and frequency of PbTx exposure in bottlenose
   dolphins from Texas coastal waters. This study documents PbTx exposure
   in Texas bottlenose dolphins between 2007 and 2017 and their association
   with co-occurring K. brevis blooms. PbTx was detected in 60\% (n = 112)
   of the animals tested. Liver tissue samples had the highest frequency of
   detection (62\%), followed by feces (41.4\%) and gastric contents
   (30.4\%). PbTx was not detected in urine or intestinal tissue. The
   concentration ranges of PbTx detected in feces (1.2-216, mean 38.4
   ng/g), gastric contents (3.3-1016, mean 158 ng/g) and liver (0.6-52.4,
   mean 8.5 ng/g) samples were an order of magnitude less than values
   reported for Florida dolphins for the same sample types. The proportion
   of dolphins recovered within 4 weeks of a bloom that tested positive for
   PbTx ('Bloom' group; 75\%) was significantly higher compared to those
   that were recovered 5-8 weeks after termination of a bloom ('Post-Bloom'
   group; 36\%; p = 0.004). The proportion of PbTx-positive animals with no
   observed bloom association ('Baseline' group; 60\%) was also
   significantly greater than the Post-Bloom group (p = 0.012). No
   significant difference in proportion of PbTx-positive animals was
   detected between Bloom and Baseline groups (p = 0.242). No significant
   differences in liver PbTx concentrations were observed between any
   pairwise combinations of the 3 exposure groups (p = 0.261). Overall,
   these findings suggest persistent PbTx exposure for many individuals in
   these populations, although the health impacts of such exposure are not
   known.},

Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins, a group of virulent marine toxins, are bound to ``site
   5{''} inside voltage-dependent sodium channels and alter their kinetics
   dramatically; this is probably responsible for clinical symptoms of
   ciguatoxin poisoning or ciguatera. Although ciguatoxins are known to
   affect the voltage dependency of both activation and inactivation
   kinetics, site 5 has not been functionally clarified. This study,
   therefore, targeted putative voltage sensors as a receptor for
   ciguatoxins. We constructed mutants, in which 1 of 23 basic residues was
   substituted with glutamine in the S4 segment for each of four domains.
   We then examined the effects of a synthetic ciguatoxin congener CTX3C on
   these mutants. Notably, the suppressive effect of CTX3C on the sodium
   current (I (Na)) amplitude of domain 2 mutants, which carried a mutation
   in the basic S4 residue of domain 2, was either reduced or eliminated.
   Kinetic analyses of domain 2 mutants in comparison with those of the
   wild type and other mutants revealed that the negative shift of the
   steady-state inactivation curve (V (1/2inact)Delta) was significantly
   decreased. The resistance of domain 2 mutants to CTX3C in terms of
   changes in V (1/2inact) is suggested to be closely related to resistance
   to the suppressive effect of CTX3C on the I (Na) amplitude. This is the
   first report to demonstrate the existence of a functional relationship
   between a ciguatoxin congener and voltage sensor segments in domain 2 of
   the alpha-subunit of voltage-dependent sodium channels, although further
   studies are needed to locate a ciguatoxin receptor.},

Title = {Oxidative metabolism by Thalassiosira weissflogii
   (Bacillariophyceae) of a diol-ester of okadaic acid, the diarrhetic
   shellfish poisoning},

Abstract = {Previous investigations into the comparative toxicity of the diarrhetic
   shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins to Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grun.)
   Fryxell et Hasle found that this diatom oxidatively metabolized okadaic
   acid diol-ester (OA diol-ester) to a more watersoluble product. This
   oxidative transformation of OA diol-ester by the diatom is significant
   for two reasons. First, it is known that dinophysistoxin-4 (DTX-4), the
   primary DSP toxin produced by the dinoflagellate Exuviaella lima (Ehr.)
   Butschli, will be hydrolyzed to the diol-ester following cell rupture
   (e.g. ingestion by a predator). Second, it implies that the ester, an
   uncharged, lipophilic intermediate, can easily enter cells and therefore
   may play an important role in the uptake and transfer of DSP toxins
   through the food web. It has been suggested that the water soluble DTX-4
   may also be the form in which DSP toxins are excreted from the producing
   cell. Therefore, the stability of DTX-4 was examined when incubated
   either in fresh seawater medium into which washed cells of E. lima were
   introduced or in seawater medium conditioned by E. lima cells. Rapid
   hydrolysis of DTX-4 to the diol-ester took place in both cases. Thus,
   regardless of the route by which DTX-4 is liberated from the cell,
   either by cell disruption or ex cretion, the diol-ester will be the
   dominant form of the toxin to challenge associated organisms. To ex
   amine the metabolism of OA diol-ester by T. weissflogii in more detail,
   serial cultures of the diatom were challenged with OA diol-ester at a
   concentration of 2.0 mu g.mL(-1). The metabolism and fate of the
   diol-ester in both cellular and medium fractions were monitored over 3
   days using liquid chromatography with either ultraviolet (LC-UV) or mass
   spectrometric (LC-MS) detection. During the course of the experiment,
   all of the diol-ester was metabolized. LC-MS analysis revealed the
   presence of multiple oxdative products of OA diol-ester in the medium
   fraction, including a carboxylic acid derivative. The major metabolites
   were isolated in sufficient quantity to permit structural elucidation by
   NMR and MS. All the metabolites identified resulted from oxidation of
   the diol-ester side chain with the primary sites of attack at the
   terminal, subterminal, and unsaturated carbons. OA was found in both
   cellular and medium fractions, and its production was directly
   correlated with the metabolism of the diol-ester. The relative
   partitioning of both OA diol-ester and its oxidation products between
   cells and medium supports the contention that OA diol-ester can readily
   enter cells, be metabolized, and then excreted in more watersoluble
   forms.},

Abstract = {A strategy to construct multivariate biomarkers for exposure to algal
   neurotoxins via correlating changes to the profiles of a series of
   neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the central nervous
   system(CNS) of exposed test organism is reported. 3-Month-old marine
   medaka (Oryzais melastigma) were exposed to waterborne brevetoxin PbTx-1
   at two sub-lethal dose levels (0.5 and 2.5 mu g-PbTx-1 L-1) for a
   duration of 12 h before quantification of 43 selected neurotransmitters
   and metabolites in their CNS were measured via dansyl chloride
   derivatization and LC-MS/MS determination. The profiling data were
   analyzed by multivariate statistical analyses, including principle
   component analysis (PCA), projection on latent structure-discriminate
   analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection on latent
   structure-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA). Neurotransmitters and
   metabolites related to activation of voltage-gated sodiumchannels
   (VGSCs), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) and cholinergic
   neurotransmission were found to contribute significantly to class
   separation in the corresponding OPLS-DA models. Those models obtained
   from different exposure dosages were correlated by the Shared and Unique
   Structures Plot (SUS-plot) to identify appropriate variables for the
   construction of exposure biomarkers in the form of multivariate
   predictive scores. The established biomarkers for male and female medaka
   fish were able to predict acute sub-lethal exposure to PbTx-1 with good
   sensitivity and specificity (male fish: sensitivity 94.7\%, specificity
   80.0\%; female fish: sensitivity 91.4\%, specificity 83.3\%).
   Neurotransmitter profiles in the CNS of medaka fish that should have
   recovered from exposure to PbTx-1 have also been determined to reveal
   long-term impacts to the CNS of the affected organism even after the
   exposure has been interrupted. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), a toxin produced worldwide by some species of the
   genus Pseudo-nitzschia, is responsible for contamination of marine
   molluscs, mammals, birds, and for human intoxication, and when detected
   in high levels results in closures of shellfish farms, thus causing
   severe economic losses to aquaculture. Studies on algal production of DA
   in cultures and field samples require sensitive methods capable of
   measuring trace concentrations of domoic acid. Measuring domoic acid
   concentrations at trace levels is still a significant challenge. A
   sensitive and reliable double derivatization using
   o-phthaldialdehyde-mercaptoethanol/9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate
   (OPA-MeSH/FMOC-Cl) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography
   with fluorescence detection has been adapted for the determination of
   trace levels of dissolved (dDA) and particulate domoic acid (pDA). The
   selectivity toward domoic acid is greatly improved by eliminating the
   reaction between FMOC-Cl and primary amines. Compared with the original
   Pocklington method, the sensitivity obtained by the double
   derivatization is largely enhanced (x6) and the reproducibility is
   significantly increased (<4\% relative standard deviation {[}RSD] for
   nanomolar domoic acid concentrations). A better precision and an
   improved inter-operator reproducibility were obtained with this two-step
   derivatization optimized protocol. This methodology will be useful for
   monitoring domoic acid production both in Pseudo-nitzschia cultures and
   in natural environmental marine samples.},

Abstract = {Following an episode of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) in mussels
   Mytilus galloprovincialis from the Ria de Pontevedra (Galicia, NW
   Spain), produced by organisms of the genus Dinophysis (dinoflagellate),
   a batch of contaminated mussels was transplanted to several
   uncontaminated sites having different environmental conditions. The
   depuration kinetics of okadaic acid (the dominant toxin involved in the
   episode) in each experimental mussel batch was monitored during a 70 d
   period, as were the corresponding salinity, temperature, fluorescence,
   light transmission and mussel body weight. Environmental conditions and
   body weight were shown to have an effect on depuration rates by
   principal component and multiple regression analysis. Although most of
   the variables studied showed a high degree of covariation, fluorescence
   and Light transmission, which serve to measure the availability of
   solids and phytoplankton for mussels, appeared to have the most
   prominent effect on depuration. Four different models were tested in
   order to describe depuration kinetics: 1- and 2-compartment models, each
   in 2 versions, with and without the inclusion of the effects of the 4
   environmental variables studied and body weight. The 1-compartment model
   without the complementary variables did not give an appropriate
   description of the kinetics, but when these variables were included, the
   general fitting was good and a pattern was found in the most important
   deviations. The simplest of the 2-compartment models fitted also
   produced an output that adequately described the kinetics observed.
   However, attempts to estimate the parameters of 2-compartment models
   including the complementary variables consistently produced a
   1-compartment model. The model chosen to describe depuration kinetics
   substantially influences the estimation of the effect of the
   environmental variables.},

Abstract = {Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) has proved problematic in Irish king
   scallop, Pecten maximus fisheries necessitating restrictions on the sale
   of fresh scallops (in-shell), which achieve a higher market price than
   frozen processed product. An investigation of variability in domoic acid
   (DA) concentration in king scallop from 69 sampling sites within a
   limited area off the southeast coast of Ireland was performed. Variation
   in DA concentration was examined in the whole area, within smaller
   sub-areas, with size, age, and water depth. Mean DA concentrations in
   whole scallop ranged from 6.5 to 154.3 mu g g(-1), with an overall mean
   of 40.6 +/- 30.8 mu g g(-1). The concentration in gonad exceeded 20 mu g
   g(-1) in 17 sites and in adductor muscle in 3 sites. Significant
   differences in DA concentration were detected between scallops from
   different sampling stations. Whole scallop tissue and individual scallop
   tissues with the exception of gonad, exhibited significant negative
   correlations with water depth. Highest DA concentrations were recorded
   in inshore, shallow sites and lowest DA concentrations in deeper
   offshore waters. Significant positive correlations between DA
   concentration in hepatopancreas and scallop size were exhibited at
   inshore sites but not at offshore sites. High inter-animal and spatial
   variability in toxin concentration demonstrated the importance of a
   reliable sampling protocol for the management of ASP outbreaks to ensure
   public safety and to avoid unnecessary fishery closures. (c) 2006

   was used as a model for immune system effects following experimental
   exposure to a predominant brevetoxin congener in K. brevis blooms,
   PbTx-3. Exposure to PbTx-3 was oral or intratracheal and health effects
   were assessed using a suite of immune function parameters: innate immune
   function (phagocytosis, plasma lysozyme activity), adaptive immune
   function (lymphocyte proliferation), and measures of oxidative stress
   (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity
   in plasma). Inflammation was also measured using plasma protein
   electrophoresis. In addition, differential expression of genes in
   peripheral blood leukocytes was determined using suppression subtractive
   hybridization followed by real-time PCR of specific genes. The primary
   immune effects of sublethal brevetoxin exposure in T. scripta following
   PbTx-3 administration, appear to be an increase in oxidative stress, a
   decrease in lysozyme activity, and modulation of immune function through
   lymphocyte proliferation responses. Plasma protein electrophoresis
   showed a decreased A:G ratio which may indicate potential inflammation.
   Genes coding for oxidative stress, such as thioredoxin and GST, were
   upregulated in exposed animals. That sublethal brevetoxin exposures
   impact immune function components suggests potential health implications
   for sea turtles naturally exposed to toxins. Knowledge of physiological
   stressors induced by brevetoxins may contribute to the ultimate goal of
   developing directed treatment strategies in exposed animals for reduced
   mortality resulting from red tide toxin exposure in sea turtles.},

Title = {Fast screening of saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, and decarbamoyl analogues in

   HILIC-HRMS},
Journal = {TALANTA},

Abstract = {The proliferation of harmful cyanobacterial algal blooms is of concern
   due to the associated release of toxins affecting ecosystems and human
   health. The paralytic shellfish poison saxitoxin (STX) is a small polar
   alkaloid that can occur in inland and marine aquatic environments. Here,
   we optimized a fast and sensitive analytical method for the
   determination of STX, neosaxitoxin (NeoSTX), and their decarbamoyl
   analogues in surface waters. The method involves a simple filtration,
   addition of isotope-labelled internal standard (ILIS), and analysis by
   on-line solid-phase extraction coupled to hydrophilic interaction liquid
   chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (on-line
   SPE-HILIC-HRMS). Except glass fiber filters, other tested materials
   (e.g., nylon, nitrocellulose) provided suitable filtration performance.
   Time-dependent adsorptive losses occurred during the LC-MS batch
   sequence if glass autosampler vials were used, while no such effect was
   observed for polypropylene autosampler vials. Matrix effects were
   evaluated for 4 different quantification scenarios, including external
   vs. internal curves and neat reagent water vs. matrix-matched curves.
   Matrix-matched calibration with ILIS correction (NeoSTX-N-15(7))
   provided the best performance overall. The analytical method was
   validated in freshwater lake water and estuarine brackish water (30
   parts per thousand salinity), with suitable determination coefficients
   (R-2 > 0.9975), matrix spike accuracy (90-107\%), and intraday/interday
   precision (RSD of 0.61-16\%). Method limits of detection (LOD in lake
   water: 0.72-3.9 ng/L) are also improved over most of the recent
   literature. The method was applied to a set of 302 surface water samples
   collected in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, and positive
   detections were reported for STX (max: 98 ng/L), decarbamoyl-STX (max:
   15 ng/L), and NeoSTX (max: 87 ng/L).},

Journal = {VETERINARY RECORD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {187},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Background The vaquita of Mexico is critically endangered, with a
   population less than 19 individuals in 2018. The population continues to
   decline and gillnet use continues in vaquita habitat.
   Methods Nine vaquita carcases were examined from 2016 to 2018 to
   establish cause of death. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), DDTs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in blubber (n=3)
   were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and faeces
   tested for domoic acid and saxitoxin.
   Results Carcases were in good nutritional status and had lesions and
   full stomachs consistent with fisheries bycatch. PCB, DDT and PBDE
   concentrations ranged between 94 and 180 ng/g, 500 and 1200 ng/g and 97
   and 210 ng/g lipid weight, respectively, which are low compared with
   other marine mammals. No saxitoxin or domoic acid was detected.
   Conclusion These findings support the conclusion that bycatch is the
   primary source of vaquita population decline and emphasise the need for
   stronger measures to eliminate gillnets from the Upper Gulf of
   California, Mexico.},

Title = {Selective Extraction and Purification of Azaspiracids from Blue Mussels
   (Mytilus edulis) Using Boric Acid Gel},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2962-2969},
Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Azaspiracids belong to a family of more than 50 polyether toxins
   originating from marine dinoflagellates such as Azadinium spinosum. All
   of the azaspiracids reported thus far contain a 21,22-dihydroxy group.
   Boric acid gel can bind selectively to compounds containing vic-diols or
   alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids via formation of reversible boronate
   complexes. Here we report use of the gel to selectively capture and
   release azaspiracids from extracts of blue mussels. Analysis of the
   extracts and fractions by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS) showed that this procedure resulted in an excellent cleanup of
   the azaspiracids in the extract. Analysis by enzyme-linked
   immunoasorbent assay (ELISA) and LC-MS indicated that most azaspiracid
   analogues were recovered in good yield by this procedure. The capacity
   of boric acid gel for azaspiracids was at least 50 mu g/g, making this
   procedure suitable for use in the early stages of preparative
   purification of azaspiracids. In addition to its potential for
   concentration of dilute samples, the extensive cleanup provided by boric
   acid gel fractionation of azaspiracids in mussel samples almost
   eliminated matrix effects during subsequent LC-MS and could be expected
   to reduce matrix effects during ELISA analysis. The method may therefore
   prove useful for quantitative analysis of azaspiracids as part of
   monitoring programs. Although LC-MS data showed that okadaic acid
   analogues also bound to the gel, this was much less efficient than for
   azaspiracids under the conditions used. The boric acid gel methodology
   is potentially applicable to other important groups of natural toxins
   containing diols including ciguatoxins, palytoxins, pectenotoxins,
   tetrodotoxin, trichothecenes, and toxin glycosides.},

Abstract = {Polyether marine toxins are responsible for the seafood intoxication
   phenomena known as neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (due to brevetoxins),
   ciguatera (due to ciguatoxin), and diarrheic shellfish poisoning (due to
   okadaic acid), Using traditional techniques of hapten (pure toxin)
   conjugation to protein to create complete antigen, animal immunization
   and antibody isolation, and specific antibody subpopulation
   purification, discriminating antibodies have been isolated that detect
   brevetoxins and ciguatoxin, but not okadaic acid, in a dose-dependent
   fashion, Using microorganic chemistry and purified toxins, a unique set
   of tools has been created for the study of polyether ladder toxin
   accumulation; depuration; and specific site localization in tissues,
   food sources, and clinical samples, Developed test protocols can detect
   toxin in dinoflagellate cells, in extracts from food sources, in
   seawater and culture media, and in human serum samples, Enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay protocols developed for eventual collaborative
   testing have been successful in limited applications within the
   laboratory (correlation coefficient of 0.92 excluding 2 outliers), and
   alternative formats are being developed to optimize the basic test for
   use in research laboratories, regulatory laboratories, and field
   inspections.},

Abstract = {A total of 133 shellfish samples were collected in seven cities of
   Shandong Province, China, from May to October, 2019. The domoic acid
   (DA) concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and their distribution characteristics were
   investigated. DA concentration was detected high in over 1/3 (36.1\%) of
   the samples of four kinds of shellfish in all three seasons in range
   from 0 to 102 mu g/kg. The highest DA concentrations were 102, 101,
   36.7, and 10.2 mu g/kg in Crassostrea gigas, Chlamys farreri, Mactra
   veneriformis, and Mytilus edulis, respectively. Geographically, Yantai
   (22.0 mu g/kg) and Weihai (16.9 mu g/kg) showed relatively high
   concentrations of DA, whereas Rizhao and Dongying presented only 0.85-
   and 1.76-mu g/kg DA, respectively. DA concentrations in the shellfish
   samples were strongly related to seasonal changes, being significantly
   higher in autumn and summer than that in spring. The DA risk exposure
   assessments indicate that dietary seafood consumption did not pose a
   health threat to general human population. In addition, three isomers
   (isoA, isoD, isoE) and 5 `-epimer DA were detected in 3.00\%-15.80\% of
   the shellfish samples. This study is the first to observe DA and its
   isomers in shellfish samples of Shandong Province. The results
   demonstrate that DA contamination is very common and should be
   continuously monitored.},

Abstract = {This is the first detailed investigation of domoic acid (DA). a potent
   neurotoxin causing Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning. in Pseudo-nitzschia
   cultures and bivalves from the northwestern Pacific. The DA analysis
   covered a total of 9 strains of Pseudo-nitzschia and 96 samples of
   commercially valuable bivalves, collected during 2007-2013 in the
   northwestern Sea of Japan. A light and electron microscopy examination
   of 161 field-collected phytoplankton samples revealed six species of the
   genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Among them, P. pungens var. pungens, P.
   delicatissima, P. calliantha, and P. multistriata are bloom-forming
   species that can reach a high percentage of occurrence (6-21\%) and a
   high density (>10(4) cells.L-1) in the phytoplankton. The DA toxicity of
   P. multistriata, P. calliantha, P. delicatissima, and P pungens var.
   pungens has been confirmed for the first time based on laboratory
   cultures isolated from the northwestern Pacific. The highest cellular DA
   concentration was found in cultures of P. multistriata and P. calliantha
   (up to 0.57 and 0.44 pg . cell(-1), respectively) isolated during their
   bloom events. Despite the domoic acid concentration in bivalves tissues
   was low and ranged from 0.01 to 0.3 mg . kg(-1) the increase of DA
   concentration in the mussel digestive gland samples during fall and
   early winter coincided with blooms caused by P. multistriata and P.
   calliantha. The Pearson coefficient of correlation between P. calliantha
   density and DA concentration in the samples of bivalve digestive glands
   was found to be high (r = 0.7). The correlation between the high DA
   concentration in the samples of bivalve digestive glands and the
   increase of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. density in plankton during bloom
   events was also confirmed using the methods of statistical hypothesis
   testing. The obtained results indicate a potential risk of seafood
   contamination in fall, which can be related with the recurrent blooms of
   toxic P. calliantha and P. multistriata in the study area.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) causes neurological effects in multiple species upon
   exposure, including status epilepticus in pregnant sea lions and an
   epileptic disease state that commonly develops in juveniles. This study
   aims to define brain toxicokinetic parameters in the pregnant rat in the
   larger context of maternal-fetal toxin transfer. Specifically,
   Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a low observable effect level of 1.0
   mg DA/kg intravenously at gestational day 20, and plasma, brain, and
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken at discrete time points
   over 24 h. Domoic acid concentrations were determined by a tandem LC/MS
   method recently optimized for brain tissue and CSF. Data showed that
   6.6\% of plasma DA reached the brain, 5.3\% reached the CSF, and DA
   levels were nearly identical in both brain and CSF for 12 h, remaining
   above the threshold to activate isolated hippocampal neurons for 2 h.
   The calculated terminal half-life of CSF was 4 h, consistent with the
   time for complete CSF regeneration, suggesting that CSF acts as a
   mechanism to clear DA from the brain.},

Title = {Profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of okadaic acid group toxins
   and pectenotoxins during toxin depuration, Part I: Brown crab (Cancer
   pagurus)},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {In 2002, two outbreaks of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occurred
   in Norway, which was later confirmed to be caused by the consumption of
   brown crab (Cancer pagurus) contaminated predominantly by esters of
   okadaic acid (OA) after feeding on toxic blue mussels (Mytilus edulis).
   In addition to OA-group toxins, pectenotoxins (PTXs) are commonly
   detected in the toxin-producing algae (i.e. Dinophysis). In this paper,
   an experiment was set up to study the fatty acid ester profiles and
   depuration rates of OA-group toxins and PTXs from C. pagurus after
   feeding on M. edulis containing these toxin groups. CA, DTX1, DTX2 and
   PTX2 SA were all detected primarily in the form of fatty acid esters in
   the crab hepatopancreas (HP). Crabs preferentially assimilated toxins of
   the OA group after feeding on the mussels for 1 week. Detailed analysis
   of the fatty acid ester profile in crabs and mussels showed that the
   ester profiles in the crabs differed slightly from profiles of the fatty
   acid esters in M. edulis, but neither ester profile nor ester to free
   toxin ratio appeared to change in the crabs during the first 2 weeks of
   deputation. Calculations of deputation rates of the free forms of toxins
   resulted in similar reduction rates for OA and DTX2, whereas the
   depuration rate of DTX1, PTX2 and PTX2 SA was considerably faster. From
   the industrial perspective, the PTX-compounds are of minor importance
   compared to the OA group toxins in crabs, considering (1) the
   uncertainty regarding the oral toxicity of the PTXs, (2) the
   preferential ingestion of OA-group toxins compared to PTXs and (3) the
   faster depuration of PTXs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {lipophilic marine biotoxin okadaic acid (OA) represents a natural
   contaminant produced by algae accumulating in seafood. Acute
   intoxications result in diarrhetic shellfish poisoning causing symptoms
   like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.
   OA was preincubated with liver enzymes present in S9 fractions from
   humans, rats and rats pretreated with enzyme inducers in the presence or
   absence of the cofactor NADPH to investigate hepatic metabolism.
   Cytotoxicity was examined in HepG2 cells and metabolites of OA were
   determined by LC-MS/MS.
   Strong cytotoxicity was observed in HepG2 cells treated with OA that was
   preincubated in S9 fractions without NADPH. However, neither metabolites
   nor a decrease of OA itself were found. The addition of NADPH to the S9
   fractions of rats resulted in a decreased cytotoxicity of OA, but a
   stronger toxicity in HepG2 cells was observed from OA preincubated in
   human S9 fractions with NADPH. Metabolite profiles of each S9 mix
   revealed that higher amounts of detoxified metabolites were formed by
   NADPH-dependent enzymes of rats compared to the same enzymes of humans.
   These differences in OA detoxification by NADPH-dependent liver enzymes
   of rats and humans may be of significance in the extrapolation of
   toxicological data from animal models (rats to humans, for example).},

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins consumed by marine predators through
   fish prey can be lethal but studies on the resulting population
   consequences are lacking. Over the past approximately 20 years there
   have been large regional declines in some harbour seal populations
   around Scotland. Analyses of excreta (faeces and urine from live and
   dead seals and faecal samples from seal haulout sites) suggest
   widespread exposure to toxins through the ingestion of contaminated
   prey. A risk assessment model, incorporating concentrations of the two
   major HAB toxins found in seal prey around Scotland (domoic acid (DA),
   and saxitoxins (STX)), the seasonal persistence of the toxins in the
   fish and the foraging patterns of harbour seals were used to estimate
   the proportion of adults and juveniles likely to have ingested doses
   above various estimated toxicity thresholds. The results were highly
   dependent on toxin type, persistence, and foraging regime as well as age
   class, all of which affected the proportion of exposed animals exceeding
   toxicity thresholds. In this preliminary model STX exposure was unlikely
   to result in mortalities. Modelled DA exposure resulted in doses above
   an estimated lethal threshold of 1900 mu g/kg body mass affecting up to
   3.8 \% of exposed juveniles and 5.3 \% of exposed adults. Given the
   uncertainty in the model parameters and the limitations of the data
   these conclusions should be treated with caution, but they indicate that
   DA remains a potential factor involved in the regional declines of
   harbour seals. Similar risks may be experienced by other top predators,
   including small cetaceans and seabirds that feed on similar prey in
   Scottish waters.},

Title = {Understanding the risks of co-exposures in a changing world: a case
   study of dual monitoring of the biotoxin domoic acid and Vibrio
   spp. in Pacific oyster},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Assessing the co-occurrence of multiple health risk factors in coastal
   ecosystems is challenging due to the complexity of multi-factor
   interactions and limited availability of simultaneously collected data.
   Understanding co-occurrence is particularly important for risk factors
   that may be associated with, or occur in similar environmental
   conditions. In marine ecosystems, the co-occurrence of harmful algal
   bloom toxins and bacterial pathogens within the genus Vibrio may impact
   both ecosystem and human health. This study examined the co-occurrence
   of Vibrio spp. and domoic acid (DA) produced by the harmful algae
   Pseudo-nitzschia by (1) analyzing existing California Department of
   Public Health monitoring data for V. parahaemolyticus and DA in oysters;
   and (2) conducting a 1-year seasonal monitoring of these risk factors
   across two Southern California embayments. Existing public health
   monitoring efforts in the state were robust for individual risk factors;
   however, it was difficult to evaluate the co-occurrence of these risk
   factors in oysters due to low number of co-monitoring instances between
   2015 and 2020. Seasonal co-monitoring of DA and Vibrio spp. (V.
   vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus) at two embayments revealed the
   co-occurrence of these health risk factors in 35\% of sampled oysters in
   most seasons. Interestingly, both the overall detection frequency and
   co-occurrence of these risk factors were considerably less frequent in
   water samples. These findings may in part suggest the slow depuration of
   Vibrio spp. and DA in oysters as residual levels may be retained. This
   study expanded our understanding of the simultaneous presence of DA and
   Vibrio spp. in bivalves and demonstrates the feasibility of
   co-monitoring different risk factors from the same sample. Individual
   programs monitoring for different risk factors from the same sample
   matrix may consider combining efforts to reduce cost, streamline the
   process, and better understand the prevalence of co-occurring health
   risk factors.},

Title = {Acquisition of organically complexed copper by marine phytoplankton and
   bacteria in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {173},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {222-233},

Abstract = {Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, but
   can cause toxicity at elevated intracellular concentrations. The
   majority of Cu (>99.9\%) in oceanic surface waters is bound to strong
   organic ligands, presumably produced by prokaryotes to detoxify Cu.
   Although laboratory studies have demonstrated that organically complexed
   Cu may be bioavailable to marine eukaryotic phytoplankton, the
   bioavailability of Cu organic complexes to indigenous marine
   phytoplankton has not been examined in detail. Using the carrier free
   radioisotope Cu-67 at an iron limited station in the northeast subarctic
   Pacific Ocean, we performed size fractionated short-term Cu uptake
   assays with three Cu(II)-chelates, and Cu-67 bound to the strong in situ
   ligands, with or without additions of weak Cu(I) ligands. Estimates of
   the maximum supply of inorganic Cu (Cu') to the cell surface of
   eukaryotic phytoplankton were unable to account for the observed Cu
   uptake rates from the in situ ligands and two of the three added
   Cu(II)-chelates. Addition of 10 nM weak organic Cu(I) ligands enhanced
   uptake of Cu bound to the in situ ligands. Thus, Cu within the in situ
   and strong artificial Cu(II) organic ligands was accessible to the
   phytoplankton community via various possible Cu uptake strategies,
   including; cell surface enzymatically mediated reduction of Cu(II) to
   Cu(I), the substrate of the high-affinity Cu transport system in
   eukaryotes; or ligand exchange between weak Cu-binding ligands and the
   cellular Cu transporters. During a 14-hour uptake assay, particulate Cu
   concentrations reached a plateau in most treatments. Losses were
   observed in some treatments, especially in the small size fractions (<5
   mu m), corresponding with faster initial Cu uptake rates. This may
   indicate that Cu cycling is rapid between particulate and dissolved
   phases due to cellular efflux or remineralization by micrograzers. The
   acquisition of Cu from the strong in situ ligands puts into question the
   historic role attributed to Cu binding ligands in decreasing Cu
   bioavailability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Detection and effects of harmful algal toxins in Scottish harbour seals
   and potential links to population decline},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Over the past 15 years or so, several Scottish harbour seal (Phoca
   vitulina) populations have declined in abundance and several factors
   have been considered as possible causes, including toxins from harmful
   algae. Here we explore whether a link could be established between two
   groups of toxins, domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxins (STXs), and the
   decline in the harbour seal populations in Scotland. We document the
   first evidence that harbour seals are exposed to both DA and STXs from
   consuming contaminated fish. Both groups of toxins were found in urine
   and faeces sampled from live captured (n = 162) and stranded animals (n
   = 23) and in faecal samples collected from seal haul-out sites (n = 214)
   between 2008 and 2013. The proportion of positive samples and the toxins
   levels measured in the excreta were significantly higher in areas where
   harbour seal abundance is in decline. There is also evidence that DA has
   immunomodulatory effects in harbour seals, including lymphocytopenia and
   monocytosis. Scottish harbour seals are exposed to DA and STXs through
   contaminated prey at potentially lethal levels and with this evidence we
   suggest that exposure to these toxins are likely to be important factors
   driving the harbour seal decline in some regions of Scotland. (C) 2015

Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms in Chinese waters have caused serious domoic acid
   (DA) contamination in shellfish. Although shellfish are at particular
   risk of dietary exposure to DA, there have been no systematic DA risk
   assessments in Chinese coastal waters. A total of 451 shellfish samples
   were collected from March to November 2020. The presence of DA and four
   of its isomers were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. The spatial-temporal distribution of DA occurrence and its
   potential health risks were examined. DA was detected in 198 shellfish
   samples (43.90\%), with a maximum level of 942.86 mu g/kg. DA was
   recorded in all 14 shellfish species tested and Pacific oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas) showed the highest average DA concentration (82.36
   mu g/kg). The DA concentrations in shellfish showed distinct
   spatial-temporal variations, with significantly higher levels of
   occurrence in autumn than in summer and spring (p < 0.01), and
   particularly high occurrence in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. The
   detection rates and maximum concentrations of the four DA isomers were
   low. While C. gigas from Guangdong Province in September showed the
   highest levels of DA contamination, the risk to human consumers was low.
   This study improves our understanding of the potential risk of shellfish
   exposure to DA-residues.},

Title = {Hot and toxic: Accumulation dynamics and ecotoxicological responses of
   mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to marine
   biotoxins during a marine heatwave},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {213},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasing marine heatwaves (MHWs) frequency and
   severity worldwide. These extreme events often cause bivalves' mass
   mortality and facilitate the growth, proliferation and dispersion of
   toxinproducing microalgae blooms associated with threats to seafood
   safety. Yet, the interactive effects between MHW and uptake of marine
   biotoxins by biota are a novel topic still lacking thorough research,
   from both the ecotoxicological and seafood safety standpoints. This
   study assessed the effects of a MHW event on the
   accumulation/elimination dynamics of diarrhetic shellfish toxins in
   Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to Prorocentrum lima and the
   ecotoxicological responses of mussels co-exposed to these two stressors.
   Results showed that acute exposure to +4 degrees C reduced toxins
   accumulation (-49 \%) and elimination (-77 \%) compared to control
   temperature. Moreover, exposure to MHW and toxins affected mussels'
   antioxidant activity, lipid and protein damage, and metabolism in a
   tissue-specific manner. These findings highlight that M.
   galloprovincialis can face higher vulnerability to toxins when MHW
   events strike.},

Abstract = {In 2005 and 2006, the central west Florida coast experienced two intense
   Karenia brevis red tide events lasting from February 2005 through
   December 2005 and August 2006 through December 2006. Strandings of sea
   turtles were increased in the study area with 318 turtles (n = 174,
   2005; n = 144, 2006) stranding between 1 January 2005 and 31 December
   2006 compared to the 12-yr average of 43 +/- 23 turtles. Live turtles (n
   = 61) admitted for rehabilitation showed clinical signs including
   unresponsiveness, paresis, and circling. Testing of biological fluids
   and tissues for the presence of brevetoxin activity by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay found toxin present in 93\% (52 of 56) of live
   stranded sea turtles, and 98\% (42 of 43) of dead stranded sea turtles
   tested. Serial plasma samples were taken from several live sea turtles
   during rehabilitation and toxin was cleared from the blood within 5-80
   days postadmit depending upon the species tested. Among dead animals the
   highest brevetoxin levels were found in feces, stomach contents, and
   liver. The lack of significant pathological findings in the majority of
   animals necropsied supports toxin-related mortality.},

Title = {Relevance and challenges in monitoring marine biotoxins in non-bivalve
   vectors},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Seafood poisoning outbreaks can be caused by marine biotoxins which are
   naturally produced by harmful algal blooms. To minimize the risk of
   acute intoxications due to consumption of contaminated seafood a proper
   monitoring program must be in place. In recent decades several
   directives have been laid down by the European Commission to regulate
   known toxins, reassess their regulatory limits and update their
   reference detection methods. However, a revision of the seafood
   organisms that can act as toxin vectors has not been carried out. The
   control system has been designed based on physiological specificities of
   live bivalve mollusks. Although the prescribed controls in EC regulation
   854/2004 apply to echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods, several
   difficulties are posed to a cost-effective monitoring program for these
   quite diverse and non-analogous groups of seafood organisms.
   Echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods are frequently secondary
   target species for toxins surveillance. In this study, the potential of
   non-bivalve organisms as toxin vectors and their threat for public
   health is evaluated based on their feeding behavior (i.e.
   filter-feeders, herbivores, predators), growth and metabolic rates,
   motile capacity and dynamics of toxin accumulation/elimination. A
   summary of previous reports on toxin accumulation and human incidents is
   presented to highlight the seafood species of higher risk to consumers,
   including crustaceans that are not listed in the EU directives for
   toxins monitoring and should be strongly considered as potent vectors of
   biotoxiris to humans. Finally, the challenges in terms of sampling
   efforts and analytical determination for the regular surveillance of
   biotoxins in non-bivalve vectors are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   past 3 yr. High abundances occurred consistently in the autumns of 1988
   to 1991, as well as in March 1990 and July 1991. Maximum abundance,
   recorded in November 1991, was in excess of 6 x 10(5) cells l-1. Per
   cell domoic acid concentrations in October and November 1991 ranged from
   3 to 31 pg and water column burdens ranged from 0.1 to 6.7-mu-g l-1. In
   their tissues, anchovies contained quantities of domoic acid equivalent

   EUROPEAN FLAT OYSTER, OSTREA EDULIS (L.)},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results from an experiment, where uptake and
   elimination of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DST) of the okadaic acid
   (OA) and pectenotoxin (PTX) groups were compared between blue mussels
   (Mytilus edulis) and European oysters (Ostrea edulis). Caged mussels and
   oysters were suspended in the water column and exposed to a dense bloom
   of Dinophysis acuta (500-2000 cells L(-1)) for 4 wk, which was followed
   by detoxification in the laboratory during 7 wk. Weekly sampling and
   analysis of OA-group toxins including fatty acid esters ('DTX-3') as
   well as PTX in individual shellfish and plankton samples were performed.
   The results showed that mussels rapidly accumulated OA-group toxins to
   levels about 10 times above the regulation limit (160 mu g OA kg(-1)
   Mussel) whereas concentrations never reached this limit in oysters
   during the field exposure. Overall, levels were 10-50 times greater in
   Mussels. The OA-group toxins were mainly in the form of esters (> 90\%)
   in oysters, whereas in mussels, the esters constituted only a minor
   proportion of total OA toxin levels. Reduction rates were estimated for
   cacti OA toxin to evaluate if faster elimination could explain the lower
   toxin retention in oysters. However, no consistent species specific
   difference in reduction rates were observed, but esters of OA appeared
   to be reduced at a faster rate in Oysters (t(1/2) = 23 clays) compared
   with mussels (t(1/2) = 35 days). In both species, the free form of OA
   was eliminated at a faster rate (t(1/2)=15-17 days) compared with free
   DTX 1 (t(1/2) = 23-31 days) and DTX2 (t(1/2) = 28-33 days). Slightly
   slower elimination rates were estimated for the ester forms (t(1/2) =
   23-42 days). Regarding PTX, PTX2 seco acid (PTX2 SA) was the major PTX
   detected in both species, but small amounts of PTX2, PTX12 and PTX12 SA
   were also found. As for the OA-group toxins, oysters generally contained
   lower total amounts of PTX compared with mussels, but the difference was
   much less apparent. Estimation of reduction rates of the different PTX
   compounds, showed that these toxins were rapidly eliminated in both
   oysters and mussels (t(1/2) = 6-13 days). We propose that differential
   rates of gut assimilation and/or biotransformation of the OA-group and
   PTX explain some of the observed differences in retention and toxin
   profiles between the bivalves, rather than differences in elimination
   rates. However, models related to differences in feeding rates, particle
   selection and behavioural response to toxic algae should be tested in
   future experiments to evaluate the importance of preingestive mechanisms
   to the differential toxin retention in these bivalves.From the
   industrial perspective, our results suggest that O. edulis may be
   regarded as a low-risk species for DST contamination, which should be
   taken into consideration by regulatory authorities in charge of sampling
   frequencies and monitoring programs for shellfish toxins.},

Abstract = {The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a
   pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to various
   ligands, particularly xenobiotics. In this context, the aim of this
   study was to shed light on the ligand affinity and functions of four
   NR1J1 paralogs identified in the marine mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, employing a dual-luciferase reporter assay. To
   achieve this, the activation patterns of these paralogs in response to
   various toxins, including freshwater cyanotoxins (Anatoxin-a,
   Cylindrospermopsin, and Microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR) and marine algal
   toxins (Nodularin, Saxitoxin, and Tetrodotoxin), alongside natural
   compounds (Saint John's Wort, Ursolic Acid, and 8-Methoxypsoralene) and
   microalgal extracts (Tetraselmis, Isochrysis, LEGE 95046, and LEGE 91351
   extracts), were studied. The investigation revealed nuanced differences
   in paralog response patterns, highlighting the remarkable sensitivity of
   MgaNR1J1 gamma and MgaNR1J1 delta paralogs to several toxins. In
   conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate mechanisms of
   xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification, particularly focusing on the
   role of marine mussel NR1J1 in responding to a diverse array of
   compounds. Furthermore, comparative analysis with human PXR revealed
   potential species-specific adaptations in detoxification mechanisms,
   suggesting evolutionary implications. These findings deepen our
   understanding of PXR-mediated metabolism mechanisms, offering insights
   into environmental monitoring and evolutionary biology research.},

Title = {Ocean modelling for aquaculture and fisheries in Irish waters},

Pages = {101-116},
Abstract = {The Marine Institute, Ireland, runs a suite of operational regional and
   coastal ocean models. Recent developments include several tailored
   products that focus on the key needs of the Irish aquaculture sector. In
   this article, an overview of the products and services derived from the
   models are presented. The authors give an overview of a shellfish model
   developed in-house and that was designed to predict the growth, the
   physiological interactions with the ecosystem, and the level of coliform
   contamination of the blue mussel. As such, this model is applicable in
   studies on the carrying capacity of embayments, assessment of the
   impacts of pollution on aquaculture grounds, and the determination of
   shellfish water classes. Further services include the assimilation of
   the model-predicted shelf water movement into a new harmful algal bloom
   alert system used to inform end users of potential toxic shellfish
   events and high biomass blooms that include fish-killing species. Models
   are also used to identify potential sites for offshore aquaculture, to
   inform studies of potential cross-contamination in farms from the
   dispersal of planktonic sea lice larvae and other pathogens that can
   infect finfish, and to provide modelled products that underpin the
   assessment and advisory services on the sustainable exploitation of the
   resources of marine fisheries. This paper demonstrates that ocean models
   can provide an invaluable contribution to the sustainable blue growth of
   aquaculture and fisheries.},

Title = {The role of marine biotoxins on the trophic transfer of Mn and Zn in
   fish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {198-205},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Essential nutrients are critical for physiological processes of
   organisms. In fish, they are obtained primarily from the diet, and their
   transfer and accumulation are known to be impacted by environmental
   variables such as water temperature, pH and salinity, as well as by diet
   composition and matrices. Yet, prey items consumed by fish may also
   contain toxic compounds such as marine toxins associated with harmful
   algae. These biotoxins have the potential to affect essential trace
   element assimilation in fish through chemical interactions such as the
   formation of trace element-toxin complexes or by affecting general fish
   physiology as in the modification of ion specific transport pathways. We
   assessed the influence of dietary exposure to brevetoxins (PbTxs),
   ichthyotoxic neurotoxins produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis,
   on trophic transfer of two essential trace elements, Mn and Zn, in a
   fish model. Using ecologically relevant concentrations of PbTxs and
   trace elements in controlled laboratory conditions, juvenile turbots
   Scophthalmus max-Onus were given food containing PbTxs before or at the
   same time as a feeding with radiotracers of the chosen essential
   elements (Mn-54 and Zn-65). Treatments included simultaneous exposure
   (PbTxs + Mn-54 + Zn-65) in a single-feeding, 3-week daily pre-exposure
   to dietary PbTx followed by a single feeding with Mn-54 and Zn-65, and a
   control (Mn-54 and Zn-65 only). After a 21-day depuration period, turbot
   tissue brevetoxin levels were quantified and assimilation efficiencies
   of Mn-54 and Zn-65 were assessed. PbTxs were found in turbot tissues in
   each exposure treatment, demonstrating dietary trophic transfer of these
   toxins; yet, no differences in assimilation efficiencies of Mn or Zn
   were found between treatments or the control (p > 0.05). These results
   indicate that, in our experimental conditions, PbTx exposure does not
   significantly affect the trophic transfer of Mn and Zn in fish.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins have been implicated as the
   causative agent of a number of fish kills. Exposure experiments indicate
   that fish are susceptible to PSPs by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and oral
   administration, while sampling of fish affected by toxic blooms reveals
   that these toxins can be accumulated. In spite of the potential impact
   to marine fisheries, little research has been conducted on the potential
   metabolism and detoxification of PSPs in marine fishes. Previous work by
   this group has shown that the xenobiotic metabolising enzyme (XME)
   cytochrome P-450 (CYP1A) is induced in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   following i.p. exposure to saxitoxin (STX). Salmon injected i.p. with
   sub-lethal doses of STX show a four- to eight-fold induction of hepatic
   CYP1A las shown by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity) over controls
   after 96 h. Results presented here show that the phase II XME
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) is also induced in salmon following PSP
   exposure. Post smolts were exposed to three injections of PSPs (2 mug
   STXeq/kg) over 21 days. Injection of both STX and PSPs extracted from a
   toxic strain of dinoflagellate (Alexandrium fundyense, CCMP 1719)
   resulted in induction of hepatic GST, as measured by activity for
   1-chloro 2,4-dinitrobenzene. Such inductions indicate a potential role
   for XMEs in PSP metabolism. Possible roles for other enzymes are also
   discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Marine toxins, produced by various marine microorganisms, pose
   significant risks to both marine ecosystems and human health.
   Understanding their diverse structures and properties is crucial for
   effective mitigation and exploration of their potential as therapeutic
   agents. This study presents a comparative analysis of two hydrophilic
   and two lipophilic marine toxins, examining their reactivity properties
   and bioavailability scores. By investigating similarities among these
   structurally diverse toxins, valuable insights into their potential as
   precursors for novel drug development can be gained. The exploration of
   lipophilic and hydrophilic properties in drug design is essential due to
   their distinct implications on drug distribution, elimination, and
   target interaction. By elucidating shared molecular properties among
   toxins, this research aims to identify patterns and trends that may
   guide future drug discovery efforts and contribute to the field of
   molecular toxinology. The findings from this study have the potential to
   expand knowledge on toxins, facilitate a deeper understanding of their
   bioactivities, and unlock new therapeutic possibilities to address unmet
   biomedical needs. The results showcased similarities among the studied
   systems, while also highlighting the exceptional attributes of Domoic
   Acid (DA) in terms of its interaction capabilities and stability.},

Title = {Symbiotic relations between bacteria and the domoic acid producing

Journal = {AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-221},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Bacteria isolated from cultures of 4 different strains of the diatom
   Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries following numerous transfers in a defined
   medium were identified as mainly Moraxella and Alteromonas sp. These
   bacteria apparently form a characteristic suite of microorganisms living
   in a symbiotic relationship with the diatom. The bacterial isolates from
   each of the P. multiseries strains divided metabolically into 2 groups;
   those that produced significant amounts of acid from carbohydrates and
   those that grew readily at the expense of amino acids. The specific acid
   forming bacteria isolated from each diatom species grown in the presence
   of glucose produced gluconic acid/gluconolactone in quantity and
   released it to the surrounding medium. For growth of the diatom a
   salinity of 33 ppt was more favorable than 26 or 38 ppt; sorbitol varied
   with the salinity and thus might be an osmolyte. Glucose was present in
   significant quantities in the diatom grown at all 3 salinities.
   Nonaxenic growth of the diatom was stimulated considerably by the
   presence of proline alone and to approximately the same level when it
   was combined with glucose or sodium acetate, but not when glycine was
   substituted for the proline. Stimulation of the growth of the diatom by
   the presence of proline was considered to be a function of the
   associated bacteria. Glycine combined with sodium acetate was slightly
   inhibitory to the growth of the diatom but both glycine plus sodium
   acetate and glycine plus glucose combinations were markedly inhibitory
   to the growth of the associated bacteria. The possible role of all of
   these features in the initiation of a bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia
   multiseries, especially in an inshore environment enriched by organic
   nitrogen, and the consequent production of domoic acid is discussed.},

Title = {Profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of okadaic acid group toxins
   and pectenotoxins during toxin depuration. Part II: Blue mussels
   (Mytilus edulis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis)},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs accumulate toxins of the okadaic acid (OA) and
   pectenotoxin (PTX) groups, which are frequently found in Dinophysis spp.
   Transformation of the OA-group toxins into fatty acid ester derivatives
   (often designated ``DTX3{''}) is common in many bivalve species but the
   degree to which these toxins are transformed vary between species, and
   is also depending on the parent toxin involved. In this paper, detailed
   profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of OA, DTX1, DTX2 and PTX2 SA
   were studied in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and European flat oysters
   (Ostrea edulis), collected during a bloom of Dinophysis spp. and after 3
   and 6 weeks of depuration. Analysis of samples by HPLC-MS/MS and
   HPLC-MS2 revealed some differences in identity and abundance of fatty
   acid moieties of the OA-group esters between species, but the 16:0 fatty
   acid esters dominated in both oysters and mussels, which is in
   accordance with the free fatty acid profiles in these species. A wider
   range of FM SA-esters were detected compared to esters of the CA-group
   toxins in both mussels and oysters, and in oysters, both 14:0, 18:4 and
   20:5 fatty acid side chains were more common than 16:0. OA-group toxins
   were esterified to a larger degree in oysters (83-93\%) compared to
   mussels (21-41\%), and in mussels a higher proportion of OA was
   esterified compared to DTX1 and DTX2. Contrary to what was observed for
   CA-group toxins, PTX2 SA was esterified to a larger degree in mussels
   (81\%) compared to oysters (64\%). Calculations of depuration rates for
   all individual esters of each parent compound showed that the esters of
   DTX1 depurated significantly slower from both mussels and oysters
   compared to esters of OA, DTX2 and PTX2 SA, but overall the deputation
   rates of esters of both toxin group were highly similar for both
   species. This indicated that differences in depuration rates are not
   causing the large species-specific differences in levels and profiles of
   these toxins. Instead, the results for the CA-group toxins suggested
   that a higher rate of esterification in oysters is the main factor
   causing the observed differences in the proportion of esters to free
   toxin. For FM SA, large differences in ester profiles and a higher
   proportion of esters of PTX2 SA in mussels compared to oysters suggested
   differential assimilation and metabolic rate processes for the PTXs
   compared to OA-group toxins between these species. Hence, although
   produced by the same Dinophysis species, conclusions about the dynamics
   of one toxin group based on results from the other group should be
   avoided in future studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ciguatera fish poisoning is a global human food-borne illness caused by
   the consumption of coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxins (CTXs).
   Some reef fishes, such as groupers and moray eels, are more toxic than
   others. We hypothesized that fish containing CTXs could produce special
   proteins or detoxification proteins as a strategy for survival during
   the accumulation of CTXs. The objective of this study was to
   characterize the differential proteomes of the toxic and nontoxic
   hepatic tissue of grouper, Cephalopholis argus and moray eel,
   Gymnothorax undulatus, which had elevated levels of CTXs. A combination
   of two dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrum approaches was
   employed for preliminary screening of the liver proteome of wild-caught
   individuals. In C. argus with elevated CTXs, the expression level of
   cytoskeleton proteins was increased, whereas those of ubiquitin enzymes,
   ATP related enzymes, and telomerase reverse transcriptase were greatly
   reduced. In CTX-containing G. undulatus, the proteins involved in Ca2+
   binding, detoxification, antiapoptosis, immune defense, enhanced cell
   survival and proliferation were elevated. In both toxic fish species,
   the ATP synthase subunit beta and cytochrome c were down-regulated.
   However further study is needed to assess their potential roles in the
   resistance mechanism to contamination by CTXs. In conclusion, the
   comparative proteomic analysis revealed that CTXs induced influx/efflux
   of Na+ or Ca2+ changes in fish liver, with a concomitant interference
   with signal transduction, metabolomics processes, detoxification,
   antiapoptosis, immune defense, enhanced cell survival and proliferation
   etc. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), the main toxin responsible for Amnesic Shellfish
   Poisoning, frequently affects the marine resources of Chile and other
   countries across the South Pacific, thus becoming a risk for human
   health. One of the affected resources is the scallop Argopecten
   purpuratus. Even though this species has a high commercial importance in
   Northern Chile and Peru, the characteristics of its DA depuration are
   not known. In this work, the DA depuration was studied by means of two
   experiments: one in controlled (laboratory) and another in natural
   conditions. All organs of A. purpuratus depurated the toxin very quickly
   in both experiments. In some organs, an increase or a very small
   decrease of toxin was detected in the early depuration steps. Several
   models were used to describe this kinetics. The one that included toxin
   transfer between organs and independent depuration from each organ was
   the model that best fit the data. It seems, therefore, that the DA in
   this species is quickly transferred from the digestive gland to all
   other organs, which release it into the environment. Physiological
   differences in the two experiments have been shown to have some effect
   on the depuration from each organ but the actual reasons are still
   unknown.},

Abstract = {In at least two mass mortality events in Monterey Bay, California,
   planktivorous fish were implicated as vectors of the neurotoxin domoic
   acid (DA) from diatoms to sea birds and marine mammals. Whereas the
   transfer of DA from planktivorous fish to piscivorous predators has been
   well established, the relationship between toxin levels in
   plankton-feeding fish and the regional abundance of DA-producing diatoms
   has not been documented. Here we present data from an extensive field
   study in which cell densities of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species and DA
   levels in anchovies and sardines were measured from samples collected
   weekly throughout Monterey Bay from 8 October 1999 to 18 October 2000.
   Four distinct blooms were documented with cell densities ranging from
   3.2 x 10(3) to 5.0 x 10(5) cells 1(-1). DA was detected in fish viscera
   samples whenever toxic diatom densities reached greater than or equal
   to10(3) cells 1(-1) in surface waters, suggesting that anchovies and
   sardines regularly consume toxic diatoms when present. Fish contained DA
   levels above the regulatory limit (20 mug DA g(-1) whole fish) only when
   toxic cell densities exceeded 10(4) cells 1(-1). DA was only detected in
   fish when toxic diatom species were also present in the water,
   suggesting that the toxin is quickly depurated and that fish are only
   dangerous vectors during the bloom period. Anchovies appear to be more
   potent vectors than sardines as they consistently contained more DA than
   sardines collected simultaneously. Maximum DA levels detected in fish
   were 1,815 mug DA g(-1) in anchovy and 728 mug DA g(-1) in sardine
   viscera samples. In fish with high viscera levels of DA, corresponding
   body tissues contained 0.2-2.2 mug DA g(-1) (0.2 +/- 0.1\% of the
   viscera level), suggesting that DA is not accumulated in edible body
   tissues to levels that threaten human consumers. Results from this study
   suggest that anchovies may be a valuable indicator species for assessing
   the risk of DA intoxication to piscivorous sea birds and mammals during
   toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in Monterey Bay.},

Title = {Expression Analyses of Genes Related to Multixenobiotic Resistance in
   Mytilus galloprovincialis after Exposure to Okadaic
   Acid-Producing Dinophysis acuminata},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is one of the most important
   aquaculture species in Europe. Its main production problem is the
   accumulation of toxins during coastal blooms, which prevents mussel
   commercialization. P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/MDR1/P-gp) is part of the
   multixenobiotic resistance system in aquatic organisms, and okadaic
   acid, the main DSP toxin, is probably a substrate of the P-gp-mediated
   efflux. In this study, the presence and possible role of P-gp in the
   okadaic acid detoxification process was studied in M. galloprovincialis.
   We identified, cloned, and characterized two complete cDNAs of mdr1 and
   mdr2 genes. MgMDR1 and MgMDR2 predicted proteins had the structure
   organization of ABCB full transporters, and were identified as
   P-gp/MDR/ABCB proteins. Furthermore, the expression of mdr genes was
   monitored in gills, digestive gland, and mantle during a cycle of
   accumulation-elimination of okadaic acid. Mdr1 significantly increased
   its expression in the digestive gland and gills, supporting the idea of
   an important role of the MDR1 protein in okadaic acid efflux out of
   cells in these tissues. The expression of M. galloprovincialis mrp2, a
   multidrug associated protein (MRP/ABCC), was also monitored. As in the
   case of mdr1, there was a significant induction in the expression of
   mrp2 in the digestive gland, as the content of okadaic acid increased.
   Thus, P-gp and MRP might constitute a functional defense network against
   xenobiotics, and might be involved in the resistance mechanisms to DSP
   toxins.},

Abstract = {An ecologically and economically disruptive harmful algal bloom (HAB)
   affected much of the northeast Pacific margin in 2015, during a
   prolonged oceanic warm anomaly. Caused by diatoms of the genus
   Pseudo-nitzschia, this HAB produced the highest particulate
   concentrations of the biotoxin domoic acid (DA) ever recorded in
   Monterey Bay, California. Bloom inception followed strong upwelling
   during the spring transition, which introduced nutrients and eliminated
   the warm anomaly locally. Subsequently, moderate and intermittent
   upwelling created favorable conditions for growth and accumulation of
   HAB biomass, which was dominated by a highly toxigenic species, P.
   australis. High cellular DA concentrations were associated with
   available nitrogen for DA synthesis coincident with silicate exhaustion.
   This nutrient influence resulted from two factors: (1) disproportionate
   depletion of silicate in upwelling source waters during the warm
   anomaly, the most severe depletion observed in 24years, and (2) silicate
   uptake by the dense diatom bloom.},

Title = {More surprises in the global greenhouse: Human health impacts from
   recent toxic marine aerosol formations, due to centennial alterations of
   world-wide coastal food webs},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Abstract = {Reductions of zooplankton biomasses and grazing pressures were observed
   during overfishing-induced trophic cascades and concurrent oil spills at
   global scales. Recent phytoplankton increments followed, once Fe-, P-,
   and N-nutrient limitations of commensal diazotrophs and dinoflagellates
   were also eliminated by respective human desertification, deforestation,
   and eutrophication during climate changes. Si-limitation of diatoms
   instead ensued during these last anthropogenic perturbations of
   agricultural effluents and sewage loadings. Consequently, similar to
   15\% of total world-wide annual asthma trigger responses, i.e. amounting
   to similar to 45 million adjacent humans during 2004, resulted from
   brevetoxin and palytoxin poisons in aerosol forms of western boundary
   current origins. They were denoted by greater global harmful algal
   bloom{[}HAB] abundances and breathing attacks among sea-side children
   during prior decadal surveys of asthma prevalence, compiled here in ten
   paired shelf ecosystems of western and eutrophied boundary currents.
   Since 1965, such inferred onshore fluxes of aerosolized DOC poisons of
   HABs may have served as additional wind-borne organic carriers of toxic
   marine MeHg, phthalate, and DDT/DDE vectors, traced by radio-iodine
   isotopes to potentially elicit carcinomas. During these exchanges, as
   much as 40\% of mercury poisonings may instead have been effected by
   inhalation of collateral HAB-carried marine neurotoxic aerosols of MeHg,
   not just from eating marine fish. Health impacts in some areas were
   additional asthma and pneumonia episodes, as well as endocrine
   disruptions among the same adjacent humans, with known large local rates
   of thyroid cancers, physician-diagnosed pulmonary problems, and
   ubiquitous high indices of mercury in hair, pesticides in breast milk,
   and phthalates in urine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reviewing Evidence for Disturbance to Coral Reefs Increasing the Risk of
   Ciguatera},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {The hypothesis that disturbance to coral reefs creates new surfaces that
   increase the risk of ciguatera is premised upon the increased algal
   substrates that develop on these surfaces being colonised by high
   ciguatoxin (CTX)-producing Gambierdiscus species that proliferate and
   enter the ciguatera food chain. Current evidence indicates that new
   algal substrates are indeed rapidly colonised by Gambierdiscus. However,
   the requirement that these Gambierdiscus species include at least one
   that is a significant (high) CTX-producer is more likely a limiting
   step. While ambient environmental conditions impact the capacity of
   Gambierdiscus to bloom, factors that limit the growth of the bloom could
   influence (typically increase) the flux of CTX entering marine food
   chains. Additionally, new algal substrates on damaged reefs can be
   preferentially grazed to funnel ciguatoxins from Gambierdiscus to
   herbivores in disturbed reef areas. In societies consuming second
   trophic level species (herbivores, grazers, and detritivores), such
   funnelling of CTX would increase the risk of ciguatera, although such
   risk would be partially offset over time by growth (toxin-dilution) and
   depuration. Here, we review evidence for six potential mechanisms to
   increase ciguatera risk from disturbance to coral reefs and suggest a
   hypothesis where ecosystem changes could increase the flux of CTX to
   groupers through a shift in predation from predominately feeding on
   planktonic-feeding prey to mostly feeding on benthic-feeding prey,
   increasing the potential for CTX to accumulate. Evidence for this
   hypothesis is stronger for the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it may not
   apply to the Caribbean Sea/Atlantic Ocean.},

Title = {Profiling of Extracellular Toxins Associated with Diarrhetic Shellfish
   Poison in Prorocentrum lima Culture Medium by High-Performance
   Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Mass Spectrometry},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Extracellular toxins released by marine toxigenic algae into the marine
   environment have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this
   study, profiling, characterization and quantification of extracellular
   toxin compounds associated with diarrhetic shellfish poison (DSP) in the
   culture medium of toxin-producing dinoflagellates were performed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass
   spectrometry/tandem mass spectrometry for the first time. Results showed
   that solid-phase extraction can effectively enrich and clean the DSP
   compounds in the culture medium of Prorocentrum lima (P. lima), and the
   proposed method achieved satisfactory recoveries (94.80\%-100.58\%) and
   repeatability (relative standard deviation 9.27\%). Commercial software
   associated with the accurate mass information of known DSP toxins and
   their derivatives was used to screen and identify DSP compounds. Nine
   extracellular DSP compounds were identified, of which seven toxins
   (including OA-D7b, OA-D9b, OA-D10a/b, and so on) were found in the
   culture medium of P. lima for the first time. The results of
   quantitative analysis showed that the contents of extracellular DSP
   compounds in P. lima culture medium were relatively high, and the types
   and contents of intracellular and extracellular toxins apparently varied
   in the different growth stages of P. lima. The concentrations of
   extracellular okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-1 were within 19.9-34.0
   and 15.2-27.9 g/L, respectively. The total concentration of the DSP
   compounds was within the range of 57.70-79.63 g/L. The results showed
   that the proposed method is an effective tool for profiling the
   extracellular DSP compounds in the culture medium of marine toxigenic
   algae.},

Abstract = {Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a problematic potent cyanotoxin, is produced by
   a variety of cyanobacteria. The presence of MC-LR in drinking water is a
   severe threat to human health as well as an environmental concern. The
   control of these algal blooms and their associated toxins is critical
   for ensuring safe drinking water to significant populations. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study about the application
   of Electron Beam Irradiation (EBI) for the control of Microcystis
   aeruginosa algae cultures and simultaneous degradation of MC-LR. The
   effects of EBI dose on MC production and removal efficiency were
   investigated by measuring intercellular and extracellular MC
   concentrations. The dramatic decreases in MC concentration in the cells
   and solution were observed under our experimental conditions. The
   correlation between Chl-a and MC concentrations is eliminated. The
   inhibition of cell growth and degradation of MC-LR by EBI is highly
   efficient during radiolysis.},

Title = {Tissue uptake, distribution and excretion of brevetoxin-3 after oral and

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur nearly annually off the west coast of
   Florida and can impact both humans and wildlife, resulting in morbidity
   and increased mortality of marine animals including sea turtles. The key
   organism in Florida red tides is the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis that
   produces a suite of potent neurotoxins referred to as the brevetoxins
   (PbTx). Despite recent mortality events and rehabilitation efforts,
   still little is known about how the toxin directly impacts sea turtles,
   as they are not amenable to experimentation and what is known about
   toxin levels and distribution comes primarily from post-mortem data. In
   this study, we utilized the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta and the
   diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin as model organisms to
   determine the distribution, clearance, and routes of excretion of the
   most common form of the toxin, brevetoxin-3, in turtles. Turtles were
   administered toxin via esophageal tube to mimic ingestion (33.48 mu g/kg
   PbTx-3, 3x/week for two weeks for a total of 7 doses) or by
   intratracheal instillation (10.53 mu g/kg, 3x/week for four weeks for a
   total of 12 doses) to mimic inhalation. Both oral and intratracheal
   administration of the toxin produced a suite of behavioral responses
   symptomatic of brevetoxicosis. The toxin distributed to all organ
   systems within 1 h of administration but was rapidly cleared out over
   24-48 h, corresponding to a decline in clinical symptoms. Excretion
   appears to be primarily through conjugation to bile salts.
   Histopathological study revealed that the frequency of lesions varied
   within experimental groups with some turtles having no significant
   lesions at all, while similar lesions were found in a low number of
   control turtles suggesting another common factor(s) could be
   responsible. The overall goal of this research is better understand the
   impacts of brevetoxin on turtles in order to develop better treatment
   protocols for sea turtles exposed to HABs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Organic ligands in whale excrement support iron availability and reduce
   copper toxicity to the surface ocean},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Nutrient recycling by marine megafauna is a key ecosystem service that
   has been disturbed by anthropogenic activity. While some hypotheses
   attribute Southern Ocean ecosystem restructuring to disruptions in
   micronutrient cycling after the elimination of two million great whales,
   there is little knowledge of trace metal lability in whale excrement.
   Here we measured high concentrations of dissolved iron and copper in
   five baleen whale fecal samples and characterized micromolar levels of
   organic metal-binding ligands as a proxy for their availability. The
   iron-ligand pool consisted of weakly-binding ligands and
   intermediate-binding ligands which enhanced iron stability and potential
   bioavailability. In comparison, 47 novel strongly-binding metallophores
   dominated copper-binding, curtailing its potential toxicity. These
   results illustrate how marine megafauna transform prey biomass into
   highly-labile micronutrients that they inject directly into the surface
   ocean, a mechanism whaling reduced by over 90\%. Thus, the rapid
   restructuring of pelagic ecosystems through overharvesting may cause
   large biogeochemical feedbacks, altering primary productivity and carbon
   sequestration processes in the ocean.},

Title = {Effect of food supply on the detoxification in the blue mussel,
   Mytilus edulis, contaminated by diarrhetic shellfish toxins},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify a possible effect of food on
   the acceleration of decontamination in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis,
   containing diarrhetic toxins belonging to the okadaic acid (OA)
   structural group. An experimental protocol was designed to describe and
   compare the decontamination kinetics and detoxification rates of
   naturally OA-contaminated mussels that had either received or not
   received food for three weeks. The protocol was applied in two trials
   (in June 2006 and June 2007, called Ker06 and Ker07), conducted one year
   apart on samples of mussels collected in the same area, at the same
   season. Okadaic acid (OA), the main lipophilic toxin produced by the
   toxic alga Dinophysis acuminata, was analysed over the course of the
   decontamination, in hydrolysed (total OA) and non hydrolysed (free OA)
   digestive gland extracts, in order to estimate acyl-esters
   (7-O-acyl-ester derivatives of OA) concentrations. OA analyses were also
   made for toxin presence in biodeposits and in the aqueous phase. Bivalve
   physiological status was evaluated by biomass measurements (dry weight
   of flesh) and two biochemical compounds (total lipid and glycogen
   concentrations). Measured physiological parameters showed that mussels
   did not suffer under experimental conditions. Both trials showed that
   the food accelerated the elimination of free and total OA. This effect
   cannot be attributed to a dilution of the toxin in the tissue, as
   results expressed in toxin burden led to the same conclusion. The
   kinetic models of decontamination differed between the two experiments:
   the model was linear for Ker06, provided that the values corresponding
   to the first two days were discarded, whereas data fitted a decreasing
   exponential curve better in Ker07. Detoxification rates increased as the
   food supply increased. After three weeks of experimentation, the
   detoxification rates for total OA in Ker06 and Ker07 were 52 and 61\%,
   respectively, in unfed mussels and 90 and 89\% in fed mussels (with the
   highest level in Ker07). Comparisons between the free OA and esters
   showed that detoxification rate was higher for free OA than for esters,
   whatever the level of food supply. The results of this study suggest
   that food increase probably accelerates elimination of OA and OA-esters
   but the latter are eliminated at a lower speed.},

Title = {Domoic acid toxicokinetics in Dungeness crabs: New insights into
   mechanisms that regulate bioaccumulation},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {140},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is an excitatory neurotoxic amino acid produced by
   several marine algal species and is the causative agent of amnesic
   shellfish poisoning. Profound differences in the toxicokinetics of DA
   have been identified in a wide variety of shellfish. We characterized
   the toxicokinetics of DA in Dungeness crabs (Metacarcinus magister)
   after oral and intravascular dosing (IV) using a variety of doses
   ranging from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg. After a 1 mg/kg oral dose, DA disappeared
   from the foregut within 2 h and largely accumulated in the
   hepatopancreas, with hemolymph and other tissues having 100-1000 times
   lower concentrations. After IV dosing, hemolymph concentrations of DA
   were unexpectedly high and toxicokinetic analysis indicated the
   steady-state volume of distribution (V-ss) was 123-197 ml/kg, which is
   well below the hemolymph volume of 350 ml/kg for crabs. This indicated
   only limited extravascular distribution of DA was occurring after IV
   injection, which is surprising considering the capacity of the
   hepatopancreas to sequester DA after oral dosing. Additional studies
   measured the partitioning of DA in hepatopancreas cellular and
   subcellular fractions. The subcellular distribution of DA was primarily
   associated with the S8 fraction and could be filtered through a 30,000
   MW cut-off filter, indicating DA was not appreciably bound to
   macromolecules. Interestingly, very little (<0.4\%) of the total
   hepatopancreas DA tissue content was associated with the cellular
   fraction isolated after dissociation and separation from tissue
   fragments. The in vivo and in vitro results led us to hypothesize that
   DA uptake and distribution is regulated by crustacean orthologs of
   ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type transporters. We tested this hypothesis
   by co-exposing crabs to DA and known inhibitors of ABC transporters
   (verapamil, cyclosporine A and MK-571) and through in vitro studies
   using isolated hepatopancreas tissue and mixed cell suspensions prepared
   from hepatopancreas tissue. The in vivo results were inconclusive in
   that the toxicokinetics of DA was not consistently altered by
   co-administration of the inhibitors. Two exceptions were MK-571, which
   significantly increased the total body clearance of DA and
   co-administration of verapamil, which significantly increased the
   hepatopancreas tissue content of DA 24 h after IV injection. Isolated
   pieces of hepatopancreas tissue were able to readily absorb DA from
   incubation media, but mixed cell suspensions did not. The absorption of
   DA or lack thereof was largely unaffected by co-incubation with
   verapamil although cell suspensions appeared to accumulate small
   quantities of DA in the presence of verapamil. Collectively, the results
   of this study suggest DA accumulates in the extracellular spaces of the
   hepatopancreas, such as the tubular lumen. Under natural circumstances,
   crabs feeding on contaminated shellfish would be expected to readily
   absorb DA, which is then stored and slowly eliminated in urine. If the
   DA exposure level exceeds the storage capacity of the tissue (as
   occurred with the 20 mg/kg dose), breakthrough occurs resulting in much
   higher systemic exposure and potential for DA toxicity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This study aims to assess and compare the kinetics
   (accumulation/elimination) of the marine biotoxins okadaic acid (OA) and
   dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1 ), between native (Ruditapes decussates) and
   invasive (Ruditapes philippinarum) clam species, and their genotoxic
   effects and DNA recover capacity after, exposure to toxic
   dinoflagellates Promcentrum lima. Clams were fed with P. lima for 5 days
   and then to non-toxic algae (post-exposure) during other 5 days. Toxin
   concentrations determined in clams by LC-MS/MS were related with DNA
   damage and repair assessment through the comet and base excision repair
   (BER) assays, respectively. Differential accumulation patterns were
   observed between the invasive and native species. The invasive species
   consistently and progressively accumulated the toxins during the first
   24 h of exposure, while the native clams showed drastic variations in
   the toxin accumulation. Nevertheless, at the end of a 5 days of exposure
   period, the native dams presented higher toxin concentrations, nearly
   reaching the legal regulatory limit for human consumption. In addition,
   native clams were vastly affected by OA and DTX1, presenting an
   increment in the DNA damage since the first day, with a correspondent
   increase in the repair activity. On the other hand, invasive clams were
   not affected by the dinoflagellate toxins, exhibiting only some signs of
   the challenge, namely an increase in the DNA repair mechanisms in the
   post-exposure period. Invasive clams R. philippinanim are better adapted
   to cope with harmful algal blooms and OA-group toxins than native
   species. These results may increase farming interest and may lead to new
   introductions of the invasive clams. In sympatry sites, exposure to
   OA-group toxins may unbalance dams species biomass and distribution as
   exposure to toxic dinoflagellates affects the native clams from cellular
   to a population level, representing a significant threat to development
   and maintenance of R. decussates populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Uptake, transfer and elimination kinetics of paralytic shellfish toxins
   in common octopus (Octopus vulgaris)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {205-211},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine phycotoxins derived from harmful algal blooms are known to be
   associated with mass mortalities in the higher trophic levels of marine
   food webs. Bivalve mollusks and planktivorous fish are the most studied
   vectors of marine phycotoxins. However, field surveys recently showed
   that cephalopod mollusks also constitute potential vectors of toxins.
   Thus, here we determine, for the first time, the time course of
   accumulation and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in the
   common octopus (Octopus vulgaris). Concomitantly, the underlying
   kinetics of toxin transfer between tissue compartments was also
   calculated. Naturally contaminated clams were used to orally expose the
   octopus to PSTs during 6 days. Afterwards, octopus specimens were fed
   with non-contaminated shellfish during 10 days of depuration period.
   Toxins reached the highest concentrations in the digestive gland
   surpassing the levels in the kidney by three orders of magnitude. PSTs
   were not detected in any other tissue analyzed. Net accumulation
   efficiencies of 42\% for GTX5, 36\% for dcSTX and 23\% for C1+2 were
   calculated for the digestive gland. These compounds were the most
   abundant toxins in both digestive gland and the contaminated shellfish
   diet. The small differences in relative abundance of each toxin observed
   between the prey and the cephalopod predator indicates low conversion
   rates of these toxins. The depuration period was better described using
   an exponential decay model comprising a single compartment the entire
   viscera. It is worth noting that since octopuses' excretion and
   depuration rates are low, the digestive gland is able to accumulate very
   high toxin concentrations for long periods of time. Therefore, the
   present study clearly shows that O. vulgaris is a high-potential vector
   of PSTs during and even after the occurrence of these toxic algal
   blooms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {During the summer of 2002 there were several episodes of human
   intoxication after consumption of brown crabs (Cancer pagurus) caught
   along the Norwegian south coast. The toxic agent was one of the
   well-known phycotoxins, the diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)
   complex, routinely found in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). This toxin
   has not previously been documented in brown crabs. The route and rate of
   toxin accumulation as well as the rate of toxin depuration in crabs were
   determined in laboratory experiments. The DSP toxins only accumulate in
   digestive organs (hepatopancreas, HP) in the crabs. When fed with blue
   mussels containing more than 1000 mug of okadaic acid equivalents
   kg(-1), the crabs accumulated 3-30\% of the toxin. After 2 weeks, the
   average toxin level in the crabs exceeded the preliminary limit of DSP
   toxins at 400 mug okadaic acid equivalents kg(-1) HP established by the
   Norwegian Food Safety Authority. A 50\% reduction in toxin level was
   observed after 14-18 days when the crabs were fed fish instead of toxic
   mussels.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin, is produced by marine algae and has
   caused toxications worldwide in animals and humans. However, the
   toxicokinetics of DA have not been fully evaluated, and information is
   missing on the disposition of DA following oral exposures at doses that
   are considered safe for human consumption. In this study, toxicokinetics
   of DA were investigated in cynomolgus monkeys following single doses of
   5 mu g/kg DA intravenously, 0.075 mg/kg DA orally, and 0.15 mg/kg DA
   orally. After intravenous dosing, DA had a systemic clearance of 124 +/-
   71 (ml/h)/kg, volume of distribution at steady state of 131 +/- 71 ml/kg
   and elimination half-life of 1.2 +/- 1.1 hours. However, following oral
   dosing, the average terminal half-life of DA was 11.3 +/- 2.4 hours,
   indicating that DA disposition follows flip-flop kinetics with slow,
   rate-limiting absorption. The absorption of DA was low after oral dosing
   with absolute bioavailability of 6\% +/- 4\%. The renal clearance of DA
   was variable {[}21-152 (ml/h)/kg] with 42\% +/- 11\% of the intravenous
   DA dose recovered in urine. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic
   model was developed for DA in monkeys and humans that replicated the
   flip-flop kinetics observed after oral administration and allowed
   simulation of urinary excretion and brain and kidney distribution of DA
   following intravenous and oral dosing. This study is the first to
   characterize DA disposition at exposure levels close to the current
   estimated tolerable daily intake and to mechanistically model DA
   disposition in a model species, providing important information of the
   toxicokinetics of DA for human safety assessment.},

Title = {Cell Volume Decrease as a Link between Azaspiracid-Induced Cytotoxicity

Journal = {TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {113},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a group of marine toxins recently described that
   currently includes 20 members. Not much is known about their mechanism
   of action, although the predominant analog in nature, AZA-1 targets
   several organs in vivo, including the central nervous system, and
   exhibits high neurotoxicity in vitro. AZA distribution is increasing
   globally with mussels being most widely implicated in AZA-related food
   poisoning events, with human poisoning by AZAs emerging as an increasing
   worldwide problem in recent years. We used pharmacological tools to
   inhibit the cytotoxic effect of the toxin in primary cultured neurons.
   Several targets for AZA-induced neurotoxicity were evaluated. AZA-1
   elicited a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization in cerebellar
   granule cells of 2-3 days in vitro; however, it did not modify membrane
   potential in mature neurons. Furthermore, in immature cells, AZA-1
   decreased the membrane depolarization evoked by exposure of the neurons
   to 50mM K+. Preincubation of the neurons with
   4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS),
   4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (SITS),
   5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB), amiloride, or
   ouabain before addition of AZA-1 decreased the AZA-1-induced
   neurotoxicity and the increase in phosphorylated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase
   (JNK) caused by the toxin, indicating that disruption in ion fluxes was
   involved in the neurotoxic effect of AZA-1. Furthermore, short exposures
   of cultured neurons to AZA-1 caused a significant decrease in neuronal
   volume that was reverted by preincubation of the neurons with DIDS or
   amiloride before addition of the toxin. The results presented here
   indicate that the JNK activation induced by AZA-1 is secondary to the
   decrease in cellular volume elicited by the toxin.},

Title = {Persistent low concentrations of diarrhetic shellfish toxins in green
   mussels Perna viridis from the Johor Strait, Singapore:: first
   record of diarrhetic shellfish toxins from South-East Asia},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {257-268},
Abstract = {Liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was
   used to identify and quantify Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP)
   toxins for the first time from tropical shellfish. Persistent, low
   concentrations of okadaic acid, 6 isomers of okadaic acid, and 5 isomers
   of dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) were detected from green mussels Perna
   viridis from 3 sites in the Johor Strait, Singapore, between October
   1995 and December 1997. Isomers of okadaic acid and DTX-1 generally
   occurred in higher concentrations than okadaic acid. The highest
   concentration of any single DSP toxin detected from Singapore shellfish
   was 97 ng g(-1) mussel digestive tissue (wet weight) of an isomer of
   DTX-1 (DTX-1a). The maximum concentration of okadaic acid detected was
   24 ng g(-1) digestive tissue. These concentrations are well below the
   generally recommended limit for consumption of DSP toxins for humans
   (similar to 1 pg toxin g(-1) digestive tissue). Naturally contaminated
   mussels rapidly depurated okadaic acid when held in a laboratory
   aquarium; however, okadaic acid and some isomers of okadaic acid and
   DTX-1 could still be detected (<1 ng g(-1)) after 32 d. Phytoplankton
   samples from the Johor Strait were examined for the origin of the DSP
   toxins found in green mussels. Four species of dinophysoid
   dinoflagellates were found, with Dinophysis caudata the most frequent
   and abundant species; although, cell densities did not exceed 5 cells
   l(-1). Five hundred D, caudata were micropipetted from phytoplankton
   samples and analysed for DSP toxins. Okadaic acid was detected (7 x
   10(-14) g cell(-1)) from D. caudata but no isomers of okadaic acid,
   DTX-1 or isomers of DTX-1. D. caudata were found in the gut contents of
   Singapore green mussels and probably contribute to the contamination of
   these shellfish; however, other as yet unidentified sources of DSP
   toxins may exist in the Johor Strait.},

Abstract = {The influence of nutritional regime and water temperature on depuration
   rates of OA-group toxins in the wedge shell Donax trunculus was examined
   by exposing naturally contaminated specimens to three nutritional
   regimes (microalgae, commercial paste of microalgae, and starvation) for
   14 days at 16 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Total OA was quantified in the
   whole soft tissues of the individuals collected in days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
   12 and 14. Mortality, dry weight, condition index, gross biochemical
   composition and gametogenic stages were surveyed. Low variation of
   glycogen and carbohydrates during the experiments suggest that wedge
   shells were under non-dramatic stress conditions. Wedge shells fed with
   non-toxic diets showed similar depuration rates being 15 and 38\% higher
   than in starvation, at 16 and 20 degrees C, respectively. Depuration
   rates under non-toxic diets at 20 degrees C were 71\% higher than at 16
   degrees C. These results highlight the influence of water temperature on
   the depuration rate of total OA accumulated by D. trunculus, even when
   the increase is of only 4 degrees C, as commonly observed in week time
   scales in the southern Portuguese coastal waters. These results open the
   possibility of a faster release of OA in harvested wedge shells
   translocated to depuration systems when under a slight increase of water
   temperature. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   irradians},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2001},

Pages = {39-52},
Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs can acquire diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins
   via ingestion of toxigenic dinoflagellates. The dynamics and fate of DSP
   toxins were investigated in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians exposed
   to cells of the epibenthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, a known
   producer of DSP toxins, in controlled laboratory microcosms. Toxin
   parameters determined were uptake and detoxification rates, and
   anatomical compartmentalization. Toxins in tissue and algal extracts
   were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). No
   mortalities occurred and feeding inhibition was not observed for
   juvenile and adult bay scallops during the 2 wk exposure to P, lima
   cells. Clearance rates were similar for scallops exposed to equivalent
   biovolume cell concentrations of toxigenic P. lima and the non-toxic
   diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii; however, absorption efficiency of
   organic matter was significantly lower with a diet of P. Lima than T.
   weissflogii, Although DSP toxin concentrations in viscera of bay scallop
   exceeded commonly accepted regulatory levels (0.2 mug g(-1) whole
   tissue) within 24 h of exposure to P. lima, after 2 wk of exposure total
   DSP toxin retained in scallop tissues was <1 \% of the total toxin
   ingested over the same period. Most of the total toxin body burden was
   in the viscera (76 \%); however, in adult scallops a significant portion
   was associated with gonadal tissue (12 \%). Toxin levels were relatively
   low in gill, mantle and adductor tissue (< 12\% of total toxin body
   burden). During the depuration period, rapid release of DSP toxins from
   scallops indicated that toxins were poorly bound to all tissues, with
   the exception of the viscera. Detoxification of viscera consisted of a
   rapid loss of weakly bound toxin components within the initial 3 d of
   depuration, followed by a much slower release of the remaining toxin at
   a rate of 8.4 \% d(-1).},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur when excess nutrients allow
   dinoflagellates to reproduce in large numbers. Marine animals are
   affected by blooms when algal toxins are ingested or inhaled. In the
   Gulf of Mexico, near annual blooms of Karenia brevis release a suite of
   compounds (brevetoxins) that cause sea turtle morbidity and mortality.
   The primary treatment at rehabilitation facilities for
   brevetoxin-exposed sea turtles is supportive care, and it has been
   difficult to design alternative treatment strategies without an
   understanding of the effects of brevetoxins in turtles in vivo. Previous
   studies using the freshwater turtle as a model species showed that
   brevetoxin-3 impacts the nervous and muscular systems, and is detoxified
   and eliminated primarily through the liver, bile, and feces. In this
   study, freshwater turtles (Trachemys scripta) were exposed to brevetoxin
   (PbTx-3) intratracheally at doses causing clear systemic effects, and
   treatment strategies aimed at reducing the postexposure neurological and
   muscular deficits were tested. Brevetoxin-exposed T. scripta displayed
   the same behaviors as animals admitted to rehabilitation centers for
   toxin exposure, ranging from muscle twitching and incoordination to
   paralysis and unresponsiveness. Two treatment regimes were tested:
   cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant; and an intravenous lipid
   emulsion treatment (Intralipid (R)) that provides an expanded
   circulating lipid volume. Cholestyramine was administered orally 1 hr
   and 6 hr post PbTx-3 exposure, but this regime failed to increase toxin
   clearance. Animals treated with Intralipid (100 mg/kg) 30 min after
   PbTx-3 exposure had greatly reduced symptoms of brevetoxicosis within
   the first 2 hr compared with animals that did not receive the treatment,
   and appeared fully recovered within 24 hr compared with toxin-exposed
   control animals that did not receive Intralipid. The results strongly
   suggest that Intralipid treatment for lipophilic toxins such as PbTx-3
   has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in HAB-exposed sea
   turtles.},

Title = {Scaling Up From Regional Case Studies to a Global Harmful Algal Bloom
   Observing System},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce local impacts in nearly all
   freshwater and marine systems. They are a problem that occurs globally
   requiring an integrated and coordinated scientific understanding,
   leading to regional responses and solutions. Given that these natural
   phenomena will never be completely eliminated, an improved scientific
   understanding of HAB dynamics coupled with monitoring and ocean
   observations, facilitates new prediction and prevention strategies.
   Regional efforts are underway worldwide to create state-of-the-art HAB
   monitoring and forecasting tools, vulnerability assessments, and
   observing networks. In the United States, these include Alaska, Pacific
   Northwest, California, Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Great Lakes, and
   the United States Caribbean islands. This paper examines several
   regional programs in the United States, European Union, and Asia and
   concludes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. At the same time,
   successful programs require strong coordination with stakeholders and
   institutional sustainability to maintain and reinforce them with new
   automating technologies, wherever possible, ensuring integration of
   modeling efforts with multiple regional to national programs.
   Recommendations for scaling up to a global observing system for HABs can
   be summarized as follows: (1) advance and improve cost-effective and
   sustainable HAB forecast systems that address the HAB-risk warning
   requirements of key end-users at global and regional levels; (2) design
   programs that leverage and expand regional HAB observing systems to
   evaluate emerging technologies for Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and
   Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) in order to support
   interregional technology comparisons and regional networks of observing
   capabilities; (3) fill the essential need for sustained, preferably
   automated, near real-time information from nearshore and offshore sites
   situated in HAB transport pathways to provide improved, advanced HAB
   warnings; (4) merge ecological knowledge and models with existing Earth
   System Modeling Frameworks to enhance end-to-end capabilities in
   forecasting and scenario-building; (5) provide seasonal to decadal
   forecasts to allow governments to plan, adapt to a changing marine
   environment, and ensure coastal industries are supported and sustained
   in the years ahead; and (6) support implementation of the recent calls
   for action by the United Nations Decade 2010 Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) to develop indicators that are relevant to an effective and
   global HAB early warning system.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Nodularin (NOD) is a harmful cyanotoxin that affects shrimp farming. The
   hepatopancreas and intestine of shrimp are the main target organs of
   cyanotoxins. In this study, we exposed Litopenaeus vannamei to NOD at
   0.1 and 1 mu g/L for 72 h, respectively, and changes in histology,
   oxidative stress, gene transcription, metabolism, and intestinal
   microbiota were investigated. After NOD exposure, the hepatopancreas and
   intestine showed obvious histopathological damage and elevated oxidative
   stress response. Transcription patterns of immune genes related to
   detoxification, prophenoloxidase and coagulation system were altered in
   the hepatopancreas. Furthermore, metabolic patterns, especially amino
   acid metabolism and arachidonic acid related metabolites, were also
   disturbed. The integration of differential genes and metabolites
   revealed that the functions of ``alanine, aspartic acid and glutamate
   metabolism{''} and ``aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis{''} were highly
   affected. Alternatively, NOD exposure induced the variation of the
   diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota, especially the
   abun-dance of potentially beneficial bacteria (Demequina,
   Phyllobacterium and Pseudoalteromonas) and pathogenic bacteria
   (Photobacterium and Vibrio). Several intestinal bacteria were correlated
   with the changes of host the metabolic function and immune factors.
   These results revealed the toxic effects of NOD on shrimp, and
   identified some biomarkers.},

   Thalassiosira weissflogii},
Journal = {TOXICON},

Abstract = {Quantitative structure-activity relationships were determined for the
   diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins, okadaic acid (OA), OA
   diol-ester and dinophysistoxin-4 (DTX-4), using a sensitive bioassay
   procedure with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. OA diol-ester was
   found to be nearly as toxic as OA. This result contradicted the accepted
   idea that only the free acid toxins, such as DTX-1 and OA, are potent
   phosphatase inhibitors. Postassay analyses using liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of cultures incubated with OA
   diol-ester showed that the ester had partially decomposed to OA, which
   explained some but not all of the observed toxicity, The formation of OA
   during the bioassay raised the possibility that cells exposed to
   inactive DSP toxin esters could metabolically activate them. This was
   examined in an additional experiment which showed that the hydrolysis of
   both DTX-4 and OA diol-ester was spontaneous and apparently not mediated
   by the presence of T. weissflogii cells, However, cells of T,
   weissflogii challenged with OA diol-ester rapidly metabolized most of
   the toxin to a more water-soluble product. From interpretation of mass
   spectral data obtained using ion-spray LC-MS, the metabolite was
   identified as an oxygenated diol-ester of OA, implying that it was the
   product of a monooxygenase-detoxification pathway. It is postulated that
   OA diol-ester, as a lipid-soluble, uncharged molecule with a propensity
   to hydrolyse to OA, may facilitate the transfer of OA across cell walls
   and membranes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Title = {BIOTOXIN UPTAKE, RETENTION, AND DEPURATION TRENDS IN PURPLE-HINGED ROCK
   SCALLOPS, CRASSADOMA GIGANTEA (GRAY 1825)},

Abstract = {The purple hinged rock scallop, Crassadoma gigantea (Gray 1825), is a
   species of interest for commercial-scale aquaculture in its native
   range, along the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California,
   Mexico to southeastern Alaska. One serious, unresolved issue, however,
   is the lack of information on uptake, retention, and depuration of algal
   biotoxins in this species. It is known that rock scallops can retain
   high levels of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), including saxitoxin and
   derivatives, within its tissues including the adductor muscle. Paralytic
   shellfish toxins can pose serious public health risks, including
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), which can be lethal in humans.
   Diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DST) produced by algal species within the
   genus Dinophysis spp. is another suite of marine biotoxins monitored by
   public health agencies, known to cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning
   (DSP) in humans. This is the first study to investigate dynamics of
   Dinophysis spp., and DST in the rock scallop. The present study examined
   uptake, retention, and depuration of two common toxic algal species and
   associated biotoxins in Puget Sound, WA: Alexandrium catenella (PST) and
   Dinophysis spp. (DST), through multiyear field exposures and controlled
   laboratory studies. Assessment of PST in rock scallop tissues by
   receptor binding assay from field and laboratory studies revealed very
   high and persistent levels of PST in visceral tissue and also PST in
   adductor muscle tissue beyond the FDA limit (80 mu g STX equivalents 100
   g-1 shellfish tissue) for safe shellfish consumption. An estimate of
   total depuration time of PST in rock scallop viscera was inconclusive,
   indicating potentially long depuration times for this species. Toxicity
   levels varied among individuals of the same cohort, size class,
   collection time, and location for both visceral and adductor muscle
   tissues. Laboratory results showed PST levels beyond the FDA limit
   within adductor muscle tissue during a 6-wk depuration period,
   indicating a shucked, adductor-only product for this species will
   require careful testing and management to ensure rock scallops are safe
   for consumption. More research is needed to decouple the complex
   interactions of Dinophysis spp., DST, water quality, and rock scallop
   physiology to inform shellfish managers and public health agencies
   reliably.},

Title = {Human Health and Ocean Pollution},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background: Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land
   by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the
   world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature
   deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and
   degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but
   insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of
   global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and
   well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning
   to be understood.
   Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean
   pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders,
   international organizations, civil society, and the global public of
   these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and
   prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.
   Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean
   pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future
   trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.
   Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread,
   worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex
   mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum,
   urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical
   chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80\% arises from
   land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff,
   atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near
   the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and
   middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly
   visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric
   tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal
   pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two
   main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global
   spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical
   fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to
   previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and
   contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the
   abyssal depths.
   Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on
   marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate
   change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine
   microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon
   dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral
   reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing
   microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the
   toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals,
   fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks
   down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple
   manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms,
   including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and
   sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and
   anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are
   triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio
   species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and
   sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.
   Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants
   whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in
   utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated
   seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's
   risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to
   methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia.
   Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and
   perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from
   plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility,
   damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce
   potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested,
   these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death.
   HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease.
   Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep
   wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is
   high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in
   frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean
   pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the
   Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale.
   Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from
   multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence
   of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's
   resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of
   atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing,
   but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning
   to be counted.
   Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean
   pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on
   law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution
   sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water
   pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes
   achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily
   polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral
   reefs restored.
   Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts
   economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves
   human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.
   Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean
   pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the
   global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at
   source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding
   human health.
   Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal
   combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury
   pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic
   waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial
   discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers
   have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs.
   National, regional and international marine pollution control programs
   that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been
   shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.
   Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale
   transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that
   creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless
   growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building
   scientific capacity in all countries.
   Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical
   ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and
   well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national
   and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.},

Abstract = {The azaspiracids are a group of marine toxins recently described that
   currently includes 20 analogues. Not much is known about their mechanism
   of action, although effects on some cellular functions have been found
   in vitro. We used the reported effects on cell viability, actin
   cytoskeleton, and caspase activation to study the structure-activity
   relationship of AZA-1 and AZA-2 and the role of the carboxylic acid
   moiety in toxicity. AZA-1, AZA-2, and the synthetic AZA-2-methyl ester
   (AZA-2-ME), where the C1 carboxylic acid moiety of AZA-2 was esterified
   to the corresponding methyl ester moiety, induced a reduction of cell
   viability in neuroblastoma and hepatocyte cell lines with similar
   potency and kinetics. Interestingly, the mast cell line HMC-1 was
   resistant to AZA-induced cytotoxicity. Actin cytoskeleton alterations
   and caspase activation appeared after treatment with AZA-1, AZA-2,
   AZA-2-ME, and biotin-AZA-2 (AZA-2 labeled with biotin at C1) in
   neuroblastoma cells with similar qualitative, quantitative, and kinetics
   characteristics. Irreversibility of AZA effects on the actin
   cytoskeleton and cell morphology after short incubations with the toxin
   were common to AZA-1, AZA-2, and AZA-2-ME; however, 10-fold higher
   concentrations of biotin-AZA-2 were needed for irreversible effects.
   AZA-2-ME was rapidly metabolized in the cell to AZA-2, while
   transformation of biotin-AZA-2 into AZA-2 was less efficient, which
   explains the different potency in short exposure times. The moiety
   present at C1 is related to AZA toxicity in vitro. However, the presence
   of a methyl moiety at C8 is irrelevant to AZA toxicity since AZA-1 and
   AZA-2 were equipotent regardless of the readout effect.},

Abstract = {One of the current obstacles to stem cell therapy is the tumorigenic
   potential of residual undifferentiated stem cells. The present study
   reports rediscovery of a synthetic derivative of okadaic acid, a marine
   polyether toxin, as a reagent that selectively induces the death of
   human pluripotent stem cells. Cell-based screening of 333 cytotoxic
   compounds identified methyl 27-deoxy-27-oxookadaate (molecule 1) as a
   substrate of two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1 (MDR1)
   and ABCG2 (BCRP), whose expression is repressed in human embryonic stem
   cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. The results demonstrate that
   selective elimination of human pluripotent stern cells can be achieved
   by designing cytotoxic small molecules with appropriate ABC-transporter
   selectivity.},

Title = {Trophic interactions, toxicokinetics, and detoxification processes in a

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {In costal ecosystems, copepods coexist with toxin-producing
   phytoplankton. The presence of copepods can amplify the phytoplankton
   toxin production and thereby increase the overall toxicity of a bloom.
   Copepods are not always affected by the toxins and can vector the toxins
   to higher trophic levels. To investigate the interactions between toxin
   producers and their grazers, we determined the kinetics of
   grazer-induced increases in toxin production and the subsequent toxin
   reduction in a domoic acid (DA)-producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia
   seriata. The cellular DA level of the diatom was within the range of in
   situ measurements. Ten days after removal of the copepods, 28\% +/- 8\%
   of the cellular DA still remained in the cells. Simultaneously, we
   monitored the toxicokinetics of DA in two grazers; Calanus finmarchicus
   and Calanus glacialis. After 144 h of grazing on the toxic diet, the
   copepods accumulated and retained high concentrations of DA. Nine hours
   after exposure to the toxic diet was terminated, the copepods had
   depurated 70\% +/- 10\% of the DA. The depuration lasted 4 +/- 2 d and
   was independent of Calanus species and treatment. We explored the
   possible physiological responses in copepods after feeding on a purely
   toxic diet from gene expression profiles of C. finmarchicus. Expression
   of genes regulating several major metabolic and cellular processes was
   reduced in copepods feeding on DA-containing diatoms, and we hypothesize
   that this is because of exposure to DA.},

Title = {Assignment of product ions produced from ciguatoxin-3C provides a deep

Journal = {RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY},

Abstract = {Rationale: Marine polycyclic ethers have drawn attention owing to their
   unique chemical structures and involvement in food poisoning and fish
   killing. To study structural diversity, we performed a structural
   assignment of product ions produced from a representative ladder-shaped
   polycyclic ether, ciguatoxin-3C, and elucidated the mechanism of
   generation.Methods: The product ions used for the structural assignment
   were produced from a precursor ion {[}M + H](+) using liquid
   chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, by employing
   an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source.Results: Three
   charged sites were considered at both terminals of a molecule. Typical
   charge-remote fragmentation was produced at the respective charge sites,
   yielding a hybrid spectrum. C-C bonds bordering two ethers could cleave
   and trigger the fission of two other bonds. Prominent ions indicating
   the serial loss of water molecules resulted from the simultaneous
   deprivation of ethereal oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The resultant double
   bonds formed long chains of conjugated polyenes, which stabilized charge
   via resonance.Conclusions: Three alternative charge sites produce a
   hybrid spectrum. The simultaneous fission of three bonds was explained.
   For the first time, intense ions due to serial dehydration were
   explained by the elimination of ether oxygen atoms and the subsequent
   conjugation of double bonds. All product ions were considered by the
   structural features of polycyclic ether that facilitates the formation
   of conjugated polyenes.},

Title = {Okadaic acid induces morphological changes, apoptosis and cell cycle

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA) is a marine toxin produced by dinoflagellate species
   which is frequently accumulated in molluscs usual in the human diet. The
   exact action mechanism of OA has not been described yet and the results
   of most reported studies are often conflicting. The aim of this work was
   to evaluate the OA effects on morphology, cell cycle and apoptosis
   induction by means of light microscopy and flow cytometry, in three
   different types of human cells (leukocytes, HepG2 cells and SHSY5Y
   cells). Cells were treated with a range of OA concentrations in the
   presence and absence of S9 fraction. OA induced morphological changes in
   all the cell types studied, and cell cycle disruption only in leukocytes
   and neuronal cells. SHSY5Y cells were the most sensitive to OA assault.
   Results obtained in the presence and absence of metabolic activation
   were similar, suggesting that OA acts both directly and indirectly.
   Furthermore, OA was found to increase the subG(1) region in the flow
   cytometry cell cycle analysis, suggesting induction of apoptosis. These
   results were confirmed by the employment of specific methodologies for
   studying apoptosis such as caspase 3 activation and annexin V staining.
   Increases in the apoptosis rate were obtained in all the cells treated
   in the absence of S9 fraction, accompanied by increases in caspase 3
   activation, suggesting that apoptosis induced by OA is a caspase
   3-dependent process. Nevertheless, in the presence of S9 fraction no
   apoptosis was detected, indicating a metabolic detoxifying activity,
   although necrosis was observed in neuroblastoma cells.},

Title = {Tetramine in the Salivary Glands of Marine Carnivorous Snails: Analysis,
   Distribution, and Toxicological Aspects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Focusing on tetramine, tetramethylammonium ion, contained in the
   salivary glands of marine carnivorous snails, this paper gives an
   overview of analytical methods, distribution in marine snails, and
   toxicological aspects. Some Neptunea snails have often caused food
   poisoning in North Atlantic and Northeast Asia regions, especially in
   Japan. The toxin of both N. arthritica and N. antiqua was first proven
   to be tetramine in 1960. Subsequent research on marine snail tetramine
   has progressed with the development of analytical methods. Of the
   various methods developed, the LC/ESI-MS method is most recommended for
   tetramine analysis in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and
   versatility. Accumulated data show that tetramine is ubiquitously
   contained at high concentrations (usually several mg/g) in the salivary
   glands of Neptunea snails. Tetramine is also found in the muscle and
   viscera of Neptunea snails and even in the salivary gland of marine
   snails other than Neptunea species, although mostly at low levels (below
   0.1 mg/g). Interestingly, the major toxin in the salivary glands of
   Fusitriton oregonensis and Hemifusus tuba is distinguishable from
   tetramine. In tetramine poisoning, diverse symptoms attributable to the
   ganglion-blocking action of tetramine, such as visual disturbance,
   headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, and nausea, develop within 30 min
   after ingestion of snails because of rapid absorption of tetramine from
   the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms are generally mild and subside
   in a short time (within 24 at most) because of rapid excretion through
   the kidney. However, it should be kept in mind that tetramine poisoning
   can be severe in patients with kidney dysfunction, as shown by two
   recent case reports. Finally, given the diffusion of tetramine from the
   salivary gland to the muscle during boiling and thawing of snails,
   removal of salivary glands from live snails is essential to avoid
   tetramine poisoning.},

Title = {Enrichment of lipophilic brevetoxins in sea spray aerosol during
   red-tides},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {366},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Red tide is caused by the accumulation of Karenia (K.) brevis, which
   produces brevetoxin (BTx), a neurotoxin. Excreted BTx is incorporated
   into sea spray aerosol (SSA), which is created from the bursting of
   bubbles at the ocean's surface. For the first time, this study measures
   the enrichment factor of BTx in K. brevis algal aerosol. During red-tide
   events in 2021 and 2022, aerosol and water samples were collected from
   Gulf Coast beaches in Southwest Florida with various levels of K. brevis
   growth. The concentrations of BTx in SSA were measured using an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The concentrations of both
   aerosolized BTx and organic matter (OM) were normalized using that of
   sodium ions and were shown to be significantly higher than those
   observed in seawater. Lipophilic BTx is present in SSA at concentrations
   that are 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than seawater, and 1-2 orders of
   magnitude higher than concentrations of OM in SSA. Enrichment of
   aerosolized BTx was also simulated in the algal culture tank with two
   different aerosol generation methods. The estimated activity coefficient
   (order of 1019) of BTx in bulk seawater using the inorganic
   thermodynamic model indicates very poor solubility of BTx in seawater
   and supports its enrichment in ocean surfaces and SSA. Examining the
   enrichment factors of BTx and organic matter in SSA contributes to our
   comprehension of the potential respiratory challenges posed by inhaled
   algal aerosols during red tide occurrences. In addition, enriched BTx in
   the uppermost layer of the ocean during red tide blooms can adversely
   influence animals that inhabit in tide flats with neurological and
   respiratory impacts.},

Abstract = {1. Ciguatera is a disease caused by sodium channel activator toxins and
   results from the consumption of warm water fish contaminated by the
   ciguatoxin class of polyether toxins. 2. Other toxins, including okadaic
   acid and maitotoxin, have no proven role in causing human illness
   associated with ciguatera. 3. Ciguatera often affects only a discrete
   region of a reef, with flare-ups of ciguatera being both temporally and
   spatially unpredictable. 4. The ciguatoxins likely arise through the
   biotransformation and acid-catalysed spiroisomerisation of
   gambiertoxin-4A produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus and it is unlikely
   that other toxic benthic dinoflagellates are involved. 5. Events leading
   to a ciguatera outbreak are initiated by environmental and genetic
   factors that favour the proliferation of gambiertoxins, with an apparent
   role for anthropomorphic effects; however, the precise factors involved
   are yet to be determined. 6. The gambiertoxins and/or ciguatoxins are
   transferred from the benthos to herbivorous species (fish, invertebrates
   etc) and then to carnivorous fish via marine food chains. 7. Factors
   influencing the concentration of ciguatoxins that accumulate in fish
   include the rate of dietary intake, the efficiency of assimilation, the
   degree and nature of any toxin biotransformation, the rate of
   depuration, and the rate of growth of fish.},

Abstract = {The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and northern quahog (= hard
   clam, Mercenaria mercenaria) are two species of economic and ecological
   significance in east coast waters of the United States and the Gulf of
   Mexico. Commercial industries for these species, especially within the
   state of Florida, are significant. The current study was undertaken to
   build upon the already established body of knowledge surrounding effects
   of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on shellfish, to provide an
   understanding of the kinetics of brevetoxins within shellfish tissues,
   and to provide an estimate of brevetoxin retention times in these
   shellfish after a bloom event.
   Individual clams and oysters were exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate,
   K. brevis at a bloom concentration of 5 x 10(5) cells.L-1 for eight days
   and then transferred to filtered water for depuration. Individuals were
   sampled periodically to determine depuration rates. Concentrations of
   brevetoxins (and/or their metabolites measured as PbTx-3 equivalent) in
   tissues were determined using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay
   (ELISA). After five days of exposure, brevetoxin levels in tissues of
   both species reached concentrations well above the regulatory limit of
   800 ng g(-1) (Pb-TX3 equivalent). Averaged concentration of brevetoxins
   in clams was 1000 ng g(-1), while the oysters averaged 1986 ng g(-1).
   After two weeks of depuration, tissue concentrations in both species
   were below regulatory levels with clams averaging similar to 204 ng
   g(-1) and oysters averaging similar to 437 ng g(-1). Toxins (or their
   metabolities) remained detectable in both clams (139 days) and oysters
   (82 days) for the duration of the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Coordination regulation of enhanced performance reveals the tolerance
   mechanism of Chlamys farreri to azaspiracid toxicity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {476},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Azaspiracids (AZAs) are lipid biotoxins produced by the marine
   dinoflagellates Azadinium and Amphidoma spp. that can accumulate in
   shellfish and cause food poisoning in humans. However, the mechanisms
   underlying the tolerance of shellfish to high levels of such toxins
   remain poorly understood. This study investigated the combined effects
   of detoxification metabolism and stress-related responses in scallops
   Chlamys farreri exposed to AZA. Scallops accumulated a maximum of 361.81
   mu g AZA1 eq/kg and 41.6 \% AZA residue remained after 21 days of
   exposure. A range of AZA2 metabolites, including AZA19, AZA11, and
   AZA23, and trace levels of AZA2GST, were detected. Total hemocyte counts
   significantly increased and ROS levels remained consistently high until
   gradually decreasing. Immune system activation mediated mitochondrial
   dysfunction and severe energy deficiency. DEGs increased over time, with
   key genes CYP2J6 and GPX6 contributing to AZA metabolism. These
   transcriptome and metabolic results identify the regulation of energy
   metabolism pathways, including inhibition of the TCA cycle and
   activation of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. AZA also induced
   autophagy through the MAPK-AMPK signaling pathways, and primary
   inhibited PI3K/AKT to decrease mTOR pathway expression. Our results
   provide additional insights into the resistance of C. farreri to AZA,
   characterized by re-establishing redox homeostasis toward a more
   oxidative state.},

Title = {LC-MS/MS Analysis of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) Toxins,

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is a severe gastrointestinal
   illness caused by consumption of shellfish contaminated with DSP toxins
   that are originally produced by toxic dinoflagellates. Based on their
   structures, DSP toxins were initially classified into three groups,
   okadaic acid (OA)/dinophysistoxin (DTX) analogues, pectenotoxins (PTXs),
   and yessotoxins (YTXs). Because PTXs and YTXs have been subsequently
   shown to have no diarrhetic activities, PTXs and YTXs have recently been
   eliminated from the definition of DSP toxins. Mouse bioassay (MBA),
   which is the official testing method of DSP in Japan and many countries,
   also detects PTXs and YTXs, and thus alternative testing methods
   detecting only OA/DTX analogues are required in DSP monitoring.
   Electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS) is a very powerful tool for the detection, identification and
   quantification of DSP and other lipophilic toxins. In the present
   review, application of ESI LC-MS techniques to the analysis of each
   toxin group is described.},

Title = {Experimental Evidence of Ciguatoxin Accumulation and Depuration in
   Carnivorous Lionfish},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ciguatera poisoning is a food intoxication associated with the
   consumption of fish or shellfish contaminated, through trophic transfer,
   with ciguatoxins (CTXs). In this study, we developed an experimental
   model to assess the trophic transfer of CTXs from herbivorous
   parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos, to carnivorous lionfish, Pterois
   volitans. During a 6-week period, juvenile lionfish were fed naturally
   contaminated parrotfish fillets at a daily dose of 0.11 or 0.035 ng
   CTX3C equiv. g(-1), as measured by the radioligand-receptor binding
   assay (r-RBA) or neuroblastoma cell-based assay (CBA-N2a), respectively.
   During an additional 6-week depuration period, the remaining fish were
   fed a CTX-free diet. Using r-RBA, no CTXs were detectable in muscular
   tissues, whereas CTXs were measured in the livers of two out of nine
   fish sampled during exposure, and in four out of eight fish sampled
   during depuration. Timepoint pooled liver samples, as analyzed by
   CBA-N2a, confirmed the accumulation of CTXs in liver tissues, reaching
   0.89 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) after 41 days of exposure, followed by slow
   toxin elimination, with 0.37 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) measured after the
   6-week depuration. These preliminary results, which need to be pursued
   in adult lionfish, strengthen our knowledge on CTX transfer and kinetics
   along the food web.},

Title = {Multi-species okadaic acid contamination and human poisoning during a
   massive bloom of Dinophysis acuminata complex in southern Brazil},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {89},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {On June 2016, a major bloom of Dinophysis acuminata complex was noticed
   over the coast of Parana State (PR), southern Brazil, an area
   unprotected by any official monitoring program. Here we report the
   results of an extensive sampling effort that ultimately led PR
   authorities to issue the first State shellfish-harvesting ban due to
   multi-species okadaic acid (OA) contamination. During its peak, the
   bloom covered an area of 201 km(2) (similar to 2.0-3.5 x 54.0 km),
   attaining unprecedentedly high cell densities along the shallow (< 15 m)
   continental shelf (mean 2.2 x 10(5), maximum 2.1 x 10 6 cells L-1) and
   adjacent sandy beaches (mean 2.8 x 10(6), maximum 5.2 x 10 6 cells L-1).
   Only OA was detected in suspension (max. 188 ng L-1). Toxin levels
   measured in bivalves were several times greater than the regulatory
   limit of 160 ng g(-1), reaching up to 3600 ng g -1 in Crassostrea gasar,
   by far the highest OA concentrations ever reported in oysters worldwide,
   7700 ng g(-1) in brown mussels, Perna perna, and lower levels in clams,
   Anomalocardia brasiliana, and mangrove mussels, Mytella spp. Nine cases
   of human intoxication were officially reported and five people were
   hospitalized with typical symptoms of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning
   linked to the consumption of contaminated bivalves. All bivalves quickly
   converted most of the OA into its esterified form, DTX-3, and eliminated
   the toxins only a few weeks following the bloom, with C. gasar being the
   slowest-detoxifying species. Lower OA levels were accumulated in
   zooplankton, gastropods and several novel toxin vectors, including
   benthic organisms such as sand dollars Mellita quinquiesperforata and
   the ghost-shrimp Callichirus major, which may act as a good indicator of
   the presence of toxins in sandy beaches, and pelagic fish species that
   can serve as potential alternative sources of OA to humans
   (Chaetodipterus faber and Mugil liza). Monitoring toxin contamination in
   seafood other than bivalves is thus recommended to ensure comprehensive
   human health protection during massive Dinophysis blooms. Additionally,
   since OA was also present at low concentrations in the liver of Guiana
   dolphins Sotalia guianensis and penguins Spheniscus magellanicus,
   exposure to biotoxins should be considered in conservation actions
   involving threatened and near-threatened marine organisms in this
   region.},

Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTX) are potent marine neurotoxins, which can bioaccumulate
   in seafood, causing a severe and prevalent human illness known as
   ciguatera poisoning (CP). Despite the worldwide impact of ciguatera,
   effective disease management is hindered by a lack of knowledge
   regarding the movement and biotransformation of CTX congeners in marine
   food webs, particularly in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. In this
   study we investigated the hepatic biotransformation of C-CTX across
   several fish and mammalian species through a series of in vitro
   metabolism assays focused on phase I (CYP P450; functionalization) and
   phase II (UGT; conjugation) reactions. Using liquid chromatography
   high-resolution mass spectrometry to explore potential C-CTX
   metabolites, we observed two glucuronide products of C-CTX-1/-2 and
   provided additional evidence from high-resolution tandem mass
   spectrometry to support their identification. Chemical reduction
   experiments confirmed that the metabolites were comprised of four
   distinct glucuronide products with the sugar attached at two separate
   sites on C-CTX-1/-2 and excluded the C-56 hydroxyl group as the
   conjugation site. Glucuronidation is a novel biotransformation pathway
   not yet reported for CTX or other related polyether phycotoxins, yet its
   occurrence across all fish species tested suggests that it could be a
   prevalent and important detoxification mechanism in marine organisms.
   The absence of glucuronidation observed in this study for both rat and
   human microsomes suggests that alternate biotransformation pathways may
   be dominant in higher vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Scallops (Pecten maximus) were contaminated experimentally by a toxic
   strain of the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense for subsequent
   study of paralytic phycotoxin distribution during depuration
   (detoxification by a nontoxic microalgal diet). The results confirm data
   in the literature concerning the high toxicity of the digestive gland,
   the similarity of its toxin profile to that of the vector alga, and the
   reduction in toxicity to one-third of its initial value after a 20-day
   decontamination period. Adductor muscle was only slightly contaminated
   (less than 50 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1) compared to initial digestive gland
   toxicity of 2,620 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1)), whereas gonad was more
   contaminated (41 to 148 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1)), showing a gradual rise
   in toxicity apparently related to increased conversion of gonyautoxins
   into saxitoxin. The most striking results concerned kidney toxicity
   which was markedly higher than that of the digestive gland. The role of
   the kidneys in the biotransformation of gonyautoxins and the anatomical
   distribution of these compounds to other tissues are considered.},

Abstract = {In order to enhance the knowledge of the putative toxinic risk linked to
   mycotoxin excretion in shellfish farming areas, the influence of
   seawater salinity was studied on 2 marine-derived Aspergillus fumigatus
   strains. This fungal species produces gliotoxin, an
   epipolythiodioxopiperazine immunosuppressive mycotoxin that can be
   accumulated in the meat of cultured blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), and
   could be responsible for disease when ingested. Two marine strains were
   grown in vitro both on a non-saline and a saline culture media and were
   compared with 13 terrestrial strains to observe the effects of seawater
   on fungal growth and gliotoxin excretion in the exudate produced. Daily
   measurement of the colony areas showed that the seawater salinity
   significantly reduced the rate of growth of all the strains. Marine and
   terrestrial strains appeared to be almost similar as regards the
   appearance, growth and gliotoxin excretion, but the marine strains
   exudation seemed to be less influenced by seawater salinity than the
   terrestrial strains. Seawater salinity, however, enhanced exudation and
   gliotoxin excretion by A. fumigatus, and thus seems to be an aggravating
   factor for the toxicity of this species in the marine environment. (c)

Title = {Molecular mechanisms of zooplanktonic toxicity in the okadaic acid-
   producing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Prorocentrum lima is a dinoflagellate that forms hazardous blooms and
   produces okadaic acid (OA), leading to adverse environmental
   consequences associated with the declines of zooplankton pop-ulations.
   However, little is known about the toxic effects and molecular
   mechanisms of P. lima or OA on zooplankton. Here, their toxic effects
   were investigated using the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Acute exposure
   of A. salina to P. lima resulted in lethality at concentrations 10
   0-fold lower than densities observed during blooms. The first
   comprehensive results from global transcriptomic and metabolomic
   analyses in A. salina showed up-regulated mRNA expression of antioxidant
   enzymes and reduced non-enzyme antioxidants, indicating general
   detoxification responses to oxidative stress after exposure to P. lima.
   The significantly up-regulated mRNA expression of proteasome,
   spliceosome, and ribosome, as well as the increased fatty acid oxidation
   and oxidative phosphorylation suggested the proteolysis of damaged
   proteins and induction of energy expenditure. Exposure to OA increased
   catabolism of chitin, which may further disrupt the molting and
   reproduction activities of A. salina. Our data shed new in-sights on the
   molecular responses and toxicity mechanisms of A. salina to P. lima or
   OA. The simple zooplankton model integrated with omic methods provides a
   sensitive assessment approach for studying hazardous algae.

Abstract = {A solid-phase extraction (SPE) method for ultra-sensitive determination
   of four lipophilic marine biotoxins in bivalve samples by coupling
   high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-MS-MS) was developed. Azaspiracid-2 (AZA2), pectenotoxins- 2,
   spirolide (SPX) and gymnodimine were simultaneously determined by
   HPLC-MS-MS in a positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. Separation
   was achieved on a reversed-phase C18 column with an acetonitrile-water
   gradient containing formic acid. During the analysis, solvent effects on
   the analytes were eliminated by using 1 : 1 water-methanol as dissolving
   solvent instead of pure methanol. Matrix effects in post-SPE extract and
   crude extract were seriously evaluated. Increased matrix effects in
   post-SPE extract countervailed the concentration purpose to some extent.
   The limits of detection of the SPE-HPLC-MS-MS method were determined to
   be in the range of 0.013-0.085 mg kg(-1), and the linear range of the
   method was in the range of 0.128-55.2 mu g mL(-1) for the detected
   toxins. The proposed method was validated in terms of linearity
   (matrixmatched standard curves), precision, recovery, repeatability and
   limits of quantification. The recoveries of fortified samples at three
   different concentration levels were satisfactory, and the intra-and
   interday precisions were < 7 and 10\%, respectively. Several bivalve
   samples were analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
   method. Different target toxins were detected in different kind of
   bivalves. Among them, AZA2 and SPX1 were first detected in Chinese
   shellfish. The levels of detected toxins were below the current European
   Union regulatory limits.},

   Gymnodinium catenatum on the marine copepod Tigriopus
   japonicus},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To understand how the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus responds to the
   toxic marine dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, we assessed acute
   toxicity and investigated swimming behavior parameters (e.g., swimming
   speed, swimming path trajectory, and swimming distance) in response to
   G. catenatum exposure. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of
   detoxification-related genes (e.g., phase I cytochrome P450 {[}CYP] and
   phase II glutathione-S transferase {[}GST]) were measured in G.
   catenatum-exposed copepods. No significant change in survival was
   observed in response to G. catenatum, but swimming speed was
   significantly decreased (P < 0.05) at a high concentration of G.
   catenatum (600 cells/mL). Furthermore, the swimming distance was
   significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared to that of the control at
   600 cells/mL G. catenatum, while no significant change in swimming path
   trajectory was observed, suggesting that G. catenatum potentially has
   adverse effects on the swimming behavior of T. japonicus. In addition,
   the transcriptional regulation of T. japonicus CYPs and -GSTs were
   significantly upregulated and downregulated (P < 0.05), respectively, in
   response to G. catenatum. In particular, certain genes (e.g., CYPs
   {[}CYP307E1, CYP3041A1, and CYP3024A2] and GSTs {[}GST-kappa, GST-mu5,
   and GST-omega]) were significantly induced (P < 0.05) by G. catenatum,
   suggesting that these genes likely play a critical role in
   detoxification mechanisms and might be useful as potential molecular
   biomarkers in response to G. catenatum exposure. Overall, these results
   elucidate the potential impacts of the dinoflagellate G. catenatum on
   the swimming behavior and detoxification system of the marine copepod T.

   water temperatures in Hong Kong (China) and Oakland were low. The
   periods with the greatest species richness of harmful species did not
   correspond to periods with the highest abundance of harmful species. The
   latter occurred in early September and mid-August, when Skeletonema
   costatum (14 000 cells l(-1)) dominated the plankton in the ballast
   water from Oakland Harbor. From April 1996 to April 1997, ballast water
   samples were collected from 34 Orient Overseas Container Lines Ltd skips
   which took 16 d to travel from Oakland to Hong Kong. Of the 34 ships, 14
   exchanged their Oakland Harbor ballast water for open ocean water
   (referred to here as reballasting). Open ocean was defined as waters
   with a depth >2000 m. Once reballasting was completed, the contents of
   ballast tank no. 1 were not discharged until the ship reached Hong Kong.
   Six harmful diatoms and 9 harmful dinoflagellate species were observed
   in the ballast water from Oakland Harbor. These included the diatom
   Chaetoceros concavicornis and the PSP (paralytic shellfish poisoning)
   toxin producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Of the 15 harmful
   species found in the Oakland Harbor ballast water, 8 (53 \%) were also
   found in the ballast water of ships that had exchanged coastal for open
   ocean ballast water. The abundance of harmful species in open ocean
   ballast water was 87 \% lower than those in the ballast water from
   Oakland Harbor. The reason that mid-ocean exchange failed to eliminate
   all harmful diatoms and dinoflagellates was probably because the ballast
   tank was never completely emptied before it was reballasted with
   mid-ocean water.},

Title = {Sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process for algal toxin
   mineralization in seawater desalination},
Journal = {DESALINATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {539},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The effects of discharged brine from desalination plants, particularly
   brine containing algal toxins during harmful agal bloom (HAB)
   occurrence, are a major concern for marine life and, as a result, human
   health. Therefore, removing algal toxins from desalination brine is
   critical for safeguarding both human health and the marine environment.
   The present work examined the mineralization of domoic acid (DA), an
   algal toxin, in highly concentrated seawater for the first time using an
   ultraviolet light activated peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS) system.
   Mineralization efficiencies, effects of various anion concentrations,
   and reaction by-products were investigated. The presence of anions such
   as chloride, bromide, and bicarbonate reduces the mineralization
   efficiency of the UV/PMS system, with bromide being the most
   detrimental. Although DA can be effectively degraded in synthetic
   seawater (35,000 ppm), total mineralization is not possible within 180
   min of reaction time, with only 38.4 \%, 44.8 \%, and 41 \% TOC removal
   in pH 3, 5, and 7, respectively, when 1 mM of PMS was used. Analyses of
   treated hypersaline seawater using ultra-high-resolution liquid
   chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   and ion chromatography revealed that DA was completely degraded in
   synthetic seawater and that, in the presence of algal organic matter, no
   toxic by-product was generated during the detoxification process.
   Overall, the UV/PMS system has the potential to be an effective
   treatment strategy for algal toxins in seawater during HAB events in the
   SWRO desalination process.},

Abstract = {Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor
   which binds many structurally different molecules. The receptor is able
   to regulate the expression of a wide array of genes and is involved in
   cancer and different key physiological processes such as the metabolism
   of drugs/xenobiotics and endogenous compounds including lipids and
   carbohydrates, and inflammation. Algae, sponges, sea squirts, and other
   marine organisms are some of the species from which structurally new
   molecules have been isolated that have been subsequently identified in
   recent decades as ligands for PXR. The therapeutic potential of these
   natural compounds is promising in different areas and has recently
   resulted in the registration of trabectedin by the FDA as a novel
   antineoplastic drug. Apart from being potentially novel drugs, these
   compounds can also serve as models for the development of new molecules
   with improved activity. The aim of this review is to succinctly
   summarize the currently known natural molecules isolated from marine
   organisms with a proven ability to interact with PXR.},

Title = {Iron Uptake Mechanisms in Marine Phytoplankton},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Oceanic phytoplankton species have highly efficient mechanisms of iron
   acquisition, as they can take up iron from environments in which it is
   present at subnanomolar concentrations. In eukaryotes, three main models
   were proposed for iron transport into the cells by first studying the
   kinetics of iron uptake in different algal species and then, more
   recently, by using modern biological techniques on the model diatom
   Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In the first model, the rate of uptake is
   dependent on the concentration of unchelated Fe species, and is thus
   limited thermodynamically. Iron is transported by endocytosis after
   carbonate-dependent binding of Fe(III)' (inorganic soluble ferric
   species) to phytotransferrin at the cell surface. In this strategy the
   cells are able to take up iron from very low iron concentration. In an
   alternative model, kinetically limited for iron acquisition, the
   extracellular reduction of all iron species (including Fe') is a
   prerequisite for iron acquisition. This strategy allows the cells to
   take up iron from a great variety of ferric species. In a third model,
   hydroxamate siderophores can be transported by endocytosis (dependent on
   ISIP1) after binding to the FBP1 protein, and iron is released from the
   siderophores by FRE2-dependent reduction. In prokaryotes, one mechanism
   of iron uptake is based on the use of siderophores excreted by the
   cells. Iron-loaded siderophores are transported across the cell outer
   membrane via a TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT), and are then
   transported into the cells by an ABC transporter. Open ocean
   cyanobacteria do not excrete siderophores but can probably use
   siderophores produced by other organisms. In an alternative model,
   inorganic ferric species are transported through the outer membrane by
   TBDT or by porins, and are taken up by the ABC transporter system
   FutABC. Alternatively, ferric iron of the periplasmic space can be
   reduced by the alternative respiratory terminal oxidase (ARTO) and the
   ferrous ions can be transported by divalent metal transporters (FeoB or
   ZIP). After reoxidation, iron can be taken up by the high-affinity
   permease Ftr1.},

Abstract = {The neuro-2a bioassay is considered as one of the most promising
   cell-based in vitro bioassays for the broad screening of seafood
   products for the presence of marine biotoxins. The neuro-2a assay has
   been shown to detect a wide array of toxins like paralytic shellfish
   poisons (PSPs), ciguatoxins, and also lipophilic marine biotoxins
   (LMBs). However, the neuro-2a assay is rarely used for routine testing
   of samples due to matrix effects that, for example, lead to false
   positives when testing for LMBs. As a result there are only limited data
   on validation and evaluation of its performance on real samples. In the
   present study, the standard extraction procedure for LMBs was adjusted
   by introducing an additional clean-up step with n-hexane. Recovery
   losses due to this extra step were less than 10\%. This wash step was a
   crucial addition in order to eliminate false-positive outcomes due to
   matrix effects. Next, the applicability of this assay was assessed by
   testing a broad range of shellfish samples contaminated with various
   LMBs, including diarrhetic shellfish toxins/poisons (DSPs). For
   comparison, the samples were also analysed by LC-MS/MS. Standards of all
   regulated LMBs were tested, including analogues of some of these toxins.
   The neuro-2a cells showed good sensitivity towards all compounds.
   Extracts of 87 samples, both blank and contaminated with various toxins,
   were tested. The neuro-2a outcomes were in line with those of LC-MS/MS
   analysis and support the applicability of this assay for the screening
   of samples for LMBs. However, for use in a daily routine setting, the
   test might be further improved and we discuss several recommended
   modifications which should be considered before a full validation is
   carried out.},

Abstract = {The five mass extinction events that the earth has so far experienced
   have impacted coral reefs as much or more than any other major
   ecosystem. Each has left the Earth without living reefs for at least
   four million years, intervals so great that they are commonly referred
   to as `reef gaps' (geological intervals where there are no remnants of
   what might have been living reefs). The causes attributed to each mass
   extinction are reviewed and summarised. When these causes and the reef
   gaps that follow them are examined in the light of the biology of extant
   corals and their Pleistocene history, most can be discarded. Causes are
   divided into (1) those which are independent of the carbon cycle: direct
   physical destruction from bolides, `nuclear winters' induced by dust
   clouds, sea-level changes, loss of area during sea-level regressions,
   loss of biodiversity, low and high temperatures, salinity, diseases and
   toxins and extraterrestrial events and (2) those linked to the carbon
   cycle: acid rain, hydrogen sulphide, oxygen and anoxia, methane, carbon
   dioxide, changes in ocean chemistry and pH. By process of elimination,
   primary causes of mass extinctions are linked in various ways to the
   carbon cycle in general and ocean chemistry in particular with clear
   association with atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The prospect of
   ocean acidification is potentially the most serious of all predicted
   outcomes of anthropogenic carbon dioxide increase. This study concludes
   that acidification has the potential to trigger a sixth mass extinction
   event and to do so independently of anthropogenic extinctions that are
   currently taking place.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine algae
   that can cause neurologic and cardiac dysfunction by activating
   glutamate receptors. Glutamate receptor overexcitation results in
   continuous cellular activation, oxidative damage, and cell death. DA
   toxicosis causes disorientation and seizures, and antiseizure
   medications are the primary treatment. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA), a
   powerful antioxidant and glutathione precursor widely used in humans and
   dogs, can cross the blood-brain barrier to provide antioxidant
   availability to brain tissue. Hundreds of stranded California sea lions
   (CSL; Zalophus californianus) are diagnosed annually with DA toxicosis
   and thus are an appropriate animal in which to establish ALA dosing
   recommendations for treatment. The objective of this study was to
   determine the population pharmacokinetics of a single 10- or 20-mg/kg
   dose of ALA administered subcutaneously into the interscapular region to
   healthy rehabilitated CSL. Blood was collected at two time points
   between 15 min and 24 h after administration. Serum ALA concentrations
   were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and parameters
   were evaluated using a nonlinear mixed effects model. ALA was rapidly
   absorbed for each dose, peaking within 20 to 30 minutes, and t(1/2) of
   40 and 32 min (10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively), followed by an initial
   steep distribution phase and prolonged elimination phase. Peak
   concentration (C-MAX) was 1,243 ng/ml (10-mg/ml dose) and 5,010 ng/ml
   (20-mg/ml dose). Serum from 13 CSLd with DA toxicosis treated with 10
   mg/kg ALA for 1 to 9 d had measurable levels, and ALA was also

   effects are noted with a C-MAX 4,000 to 5,000 ng/ml in humans; thus in
   CSLs, 20 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily may be sufficient

Title = {Toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and clearance of saxitoxin, a component
   of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP), in cats},

Abstract = {Saxitoxin (STX) was the first known and most studied toxic component of
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). This toxin blocks neuronal
   transmission by binding to the voltage-gated Na+ channel. Although the
   toxin's mechanism of action is well known at the molecular level, there
   are still many unresolved questions about its pharmacokinetics and the
   PSP intoxication syndrome in mammals. Some of these questions are
   addressed in the present paper, which describes an experimental design
   which allowed us to follow the dynamics of STX poisoning in vivo. Adult
   cats were anaesthetized and permanently coupled to artificial
   ventilation, they were then intravenously injected with low (2.7 mu g of
   STX/kg) and high doses (10 mu g of STX/kg) of toxin. Cardiovascular
   parameters such as blood pressure and electrocardiograms were recorded,
   urine and blood samples were collected during the four hours of
   experimental time. In order to quantify mass amount of STX, we used the
   post-column derivatization HPLC method. Urine and blood samples were
   cleansed using a C-18 Sep-Pack cartridge and ultrafree microcentrifuge
   filters. At the end of each experiment, the animals were killed and
   tissue samples from brain, liver, spleen and medulla oblongata were
   extracted to measure the amount of STX. As compared to control period.
   Low doses of STX made no difference in hemodynamics parameters. In
   contrast, high doses drastically reduced blued pressure, produced
   myocardial failure and finally cardiac arrest. Administration of 2.5 mu
   g/kg x min of dobutamine restored hemodynamics parameters and allowed
   the animal to overcome the shock. With high doses, the calculated STX
   renal clearance in cats is 0.81 ml/min x kg(-1). This valued corresponds
   to 20.25\% of the reported inulin renal clearance. Nevertheless with Low
   doses the STX renal clearance is 3.99 ml/min x kg(-1). This data suggest
   that in cats with normal cardiovascular parameters and diuresis, the STX
   excretion mainly involves glomerular filtration. During experimental
   time, no PSP toxins other than STX was detected in the body fluids and
   tissue samples analyzed, indicating that the mammals can not metabolize
   this molecule. STX was found in intensely irrigated organs such as the
   liver and spleen but also in the central nervous system (brain and
   medulla oblongata), showing that STX was capable of crossing the
   blood-brain barrier. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Mussel toxicity was assessed weekly in a 134-day sampling period using

   mussels at low Pbc cell density (approximate to 10(2) cells/L) and the

Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {The occurrence of freshwater harmful algal bloom toxins impacting the
   coastal ocean is an emerging threat, and the potential for invertebrate
   prey items to concentrate toxin and cause harm to human and wildlife
   consumers is not yet fully recognized. We examined toxin uptake and
   release in marine mussels for both particulate and dissolved phases of
   the hepatotoxin microcystin, produced by the freshwater cyanobacterial
   genus Microcystis. We also extended our experimental investigation of
   particulate toxin to include oysters (Crassostrea sp.) grown
   commercially for aquaculture. California mussels (Mytilus californianus)
   and oysters were exposed to Microcystis and microcystin toxin for 24 h
   at varying concentrations, and then were placed in constantly flowing
   seawater and sampled through time simulating riverine flushing events to
   the coastal ocean. Mussels exposed to particulate microcystin purged the
   toxin slowly, with toxin detectable for at least 8 weeks post-exposure
   and maximum toxin of 39.11 ng/g after exposure to 26.65 mu g/L
   microcystins. Dissolved toxin was also taken up by California mussels,
   with maximum concentrations of 20.74 ng/g after exposure to 7.74 mu g/L
   microcystin, but was purged more rapidly. Oysters also took up
   particulate toxin but purged it more quickly than mussels. Additionally,
   naturally occurring marine mussels collected from San Francisco Bay
   tested positive for high levels of microcystin toxin. These results
   suggest that ephemeral discharge of Microcystis or microcystin to
   estuaries and the coastal ocean accumulate in higher trophic levels for
   weeks to months following exposure. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {This study investigates whether feeding on the domoic acid
   (DA)-producing diatom Pseudo-nitzschia seriata affects the faecal pellet
   (FP) production (proxy for grazing) and fecundity of Calanus
   finmarchicus and Calanus glacialis. Female copepods were fed a
   saturating concentration of food (400 mu g C L-1) in two combinations
   (i) natural phytoplankton spiked with 50\% P. seriata and (ii) only the
   non-toxic phytoplankton community. The copepods ingested DA, as
   illustrated by DA accumulation in their FPs, and transferred a share of
   DA to their eggs and body tissue. DA was mainly excreted through FPs in
   both species. Compared with C. finmarchicus, C. glacialis accumulated
   substantially more DA in its body tissue. For both species, egg
   production and hatching success were unaffected by grazing on the toxic
   diatom. This suggests that feeding on DA-containing P. seriata does not
   affect copepod fecundity, despite increasing DA concentrations of P.
   seriata during the experiment.},

Abstract = {The toxic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus sp. has recently been observed in
   temperate areas in the Southern Sea of the Republic of Korea. The
   purpose of this study was to examine the toxicity of Gambierdiscus sp.
   toward the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus. T. japonicus adult
   females and nauplii were exposed to various concentrations of algae or
   culture medium to assess toxicity and analyze gene expression patterns
   in the copepod. Based on the toxicity tests, Gambierdiscus sp. increased
   the mortality of nauplii and the immobility of adult females. The
   survival and mobility of T. japonicus were not affected by culture
   medium lacking Gambierdiscus sp. cells in the toxicity test. However,
   based on the analysis of gene expression in the copepod, exposure of the
   copepod to culture medium affected the expression of stress or
   detoxification-related genes. Further studies to identify toxins in
   Gambierdiscus sp. are required to increase our understanding of
   dinoflagellate toxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of natural toxic
   substances often found in marine bivalves. Accumulation, anatomical
   distribution, biotransformation and depuration of PSTs in different
   tissues of bivalves, however, are still not very well understood. In
   this study, we investigated biokinetics and biotransformation of PSTs in
   six different tissues, namely gill, mantle, gonad, adductor muscle,
   kidney, and digestive gland, in Yesso scallops Patinopecten yessoensis
   exposed to a toxic strain of dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum. High
   daily accumulation rate (DAR) was recorded at the beginning stage of the
   experiment. Most of the PSTs in toxic algae ingested by scallops were
   retained and the toxicity level of PSTs in scallops exceeded the
   regulatory limit within 5 days. At the late stage of the experiment,
   however, DAR decreased obviously due to the removal of PSTs. Fitting
   results of the biokinetics model indicated that the amount of PSTs
   transferred from digestive gland to mantle, adductor muscle, gonad,
   kidney, and gill in a decreasing order, and adductor muscle, kidney, and
   gonad had higher removal rate than gill and mantle. Toxin profile in
   digestive gland was dominated by N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins 1/2 (C1/2),
   closely resembled that of the toxic algae. In contrast, toxin components
   in kidney were dominated by high- potency neosaxitoxin (NEO) and
   saxitoxin (STX), suggesting that the kidney be a major organ for
   transformation of PSTs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Accumulation, transformation and breakdown of DSP toxins from the toxic
   dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta in blue mussels, Mytilus

Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxins (DTX) and pectenotoxins (PTX)
   produced by the dinoflagellates Dinophysis spp. can accumulate in
   shellfish and cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning upon human
   consumption. Shellfish toxicity is a result of algal abundance and
   toxicity as well as accumulation and depuration kinetics in mussels. We
   mass-cultured Dinophysis acuta containing OA, DTX-1b and PTX-2 and fed
   it to the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis under controlled laboratory
   conditions for a week to study toxin accumulation and transformation.
   Contents of OA and DTX-1b in mussels increased linearly with incubation
   time, and the net toxin accumulation was 66\% and 71\% for OA and
   DTX-1b, respectively. Large proportions (approximate to 50\%) of both
   these toxins were transformed to fatty acid esters. Most PTX-2 was
   transformed to PTX-2 seco-acid and net accumulation was initially high,
   but decreased progressively throughout the experiment, likely due to
   esterification and loss of detestability. We also quantified depuration
   during the subsequent four days and found half-life times of 5-6 days
   for OA and DTX-1b. Measurements of dissolved toxins revealed that
   depuration was achieved through excreting rather than metabolizing
   toxins. This is the first study to construct a full mass balance of DSP
   toxins during both accumulation and deputation, and we demonstrate rapid
   toxin accumulation in mussels at realistic in situ levels of Dinophysis.
   Applying the observed accumulation and depuration kinetics, we model
   mussel toxicity, and demonstrate that a concentration of only 75
   Dinophysis cells I-1 is enough to make 60 mm long mussels exceed the
   regulatory threshold for OA equivalents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A strain of Aspergillus fumigatus has been isolated from sediments of a
   mussel bed. When cultured in hyper saline conditions (with sea-water),
   it produces a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive toxin, gliotoxin, which is
   excreted in an exudate. In order to know if this toxin could represent a
   risk for shellfish consumers, an experiment of bioaccumulation of
   gliotoxin in mussel has been carried out. After 6 days of contamination,
   toxin was accumulated in the meat of the mussels, at a level up to 2.9
   mug/mg of extract weight. with a mode of contamination different to the
   classical digestive process described for a majority of marine toxins,
   but similar to the contamination mode of domoic acid. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {A mollusk VDR/PXR/CAR-like (NR1J) nuclear receptor provides insight into
   ancient detoxification mechanisms},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {61-69},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The origin and diversification of the metazoan endocrine systems
   represents a fundamental research issue in biology. Nuclear receptors
   are critical components of these systems. A particular group named
   VDR/PXR/CAR (NR1I/J) is central in the mediation of detoxification
   responses. While orthologues have been thoroughly characterized in
   vertebrates, a sparse representation is currently available for
   invertebrates. Here, we provide the first isolation and characterization
   of a lophotrochozoan protostome VDR/PXR/CAR nuclear receptor (NR1J), in
   the estuarine bivalve the peppery furrow shell (Scrobicularia piano).
   Using a reporter gene assay, we evaluated the xenobiotic receptor
   plasticity comparing the human PXR with the S. plana NR1J beta. Our
   results show that the molluscan receptor responds to a natural toxin
   (okadaic acid) in a similar fashion to that reported for other
   invertebrates. In contrast, the pesticide esfenvalerate displayed a
   unique response, since it down regulated transactivation at higher
   concentrations, while for triclosan no response was observed.
   Additionally, we uncovered lineage specific gene duplications and gene
   loss in the gene group encoding NRs in protostomes with likely impacts
   on the complexity of detoxification mechanisms across different phyla.
   Our findings pave the way for the development of multi-specific sensor
   tools to screen xenobiotic compounds acting via the NR1I/J group. (C)

Title = {Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT): a new monitoring tool

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {44},
Number = {8},
Pages = {901-918},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {A simple and sensitive in situ method for monitoring the occurrence of
   toxic algal blooms and shellfish contamination events has been
   developed. The technique involves the passive adsorption of biotoxins
   onto porous synthetic resin filled sachets (SPATT bags) and their
   subsequent extraction and analysis. The success of the method is founded
   on the observation that during algal blooms significant amounts of
   toxin, including the low polarity lipophilic compounds such as the
   pectenotoxins and the okadaic acid complex toxins, are dissolved in the
   seawater. The results of field trials during Dinophysis acuminata and
   Protoceratium reticulatum blooms are presented. These data prove the
   concept and demonstrate that the technique provides a means of
   forecasting shellfish contamination events and predicting the net
   accumulation of polyether toxins by mussels. As an early warning method
   it has many advantages over current monitoring techniques such as
   shellfish-flesh testing and phytoplankton monitoring. In contrast to the
   circumstantial evidence provided by genetic probe technologies and
   conventional phytoplankton monitoring methods, it directly targets the
   toxic compounds of interest. The extracts that are obtained for analysis
   lack many of the extraneous lipophilic materials in crude shellfish
   extracts so that many of the matrix problems associated with chemical
   and biological analysis of these extracts are eliminated. Analyses can
   confidently target parent compounds only, because analytical and
   toxicological uncertainties associated with the multiplicity of toxin
   analogues produced by in vivo biotransformation in shellfish tissues are
   reduced. Time integrated sampling provides a good simulation of biotoxin
   accumulation in filter feeders and the high sensitivity provides lengthy
   early warning and conservative estimates of contamination potential. The
   technique may reduce monitoring costs and provide improved spatial and
   temporal sampling opportunities. When coupled with appropriate
   analytical techniques (e.g. LC-MS/MS multi-toxin screens, ELISA assays,
   receptor binding assays), the technique has the potential to offer a
   universal early warning method for marine and freshwater micro-algae
   toxins. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the occurrence of diarrhetic shellfish toxins
   (DSTs) and their producing phytoplankton species in southern Brazil, as
   well as the potential for toxin accumulation in co-occurring mussels
   (Perna perna) and octopuses (Octopus vulgaris). During the spring in
   2012 and 2013, cells of Dinophysis acuminata complex were always
   present, sometimes at relatively high abundances (max. 1143 cells L-1),
   likely the main source of okadaic acid (OA) in the plankton (max. 34 ng
   L-1). Dinophysis caudata occurred at lower cell densities in 2013 when
   the lipophilic toxins pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and PTX-2 seco acid were
   detected in plankton and mussel samples. Here, we report for the first
   time the accumulation of DSTs in octopuses, probably linked to the
   consumption of contaminated bivalves. Perna perna mussels were
   consistently contaminated with different DSTs (max. 42 mu g kg(-1)), and
   all octopuses analyzed (n = 5) accumulated OA in different
   organs/tissues: digestive glands (DGs) > arms > gills > kidneys >
   stomach + intestine. Additionally, similar concentrations of
   7-O-palmytoyl OA and 7-O-palmytoly dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) were
   frequently detected in the hepatopancreas of P. perna and DGs of O.
   vulgaris. Therefore, octopuses can be considered a potential vector of
   DSTs to both humans and top predators such as marine mammals.},

Abstract = {In the current study, we compared protein profiles in gills of Perna
   viridis after exposure to Prorocentrum lima, a dinoflagellate producing
   DSP toxins, and identified the differential abundances of protein spots
   using 2D-electrophoresis. After exposure to P. lima, the level of
   okadaic acid (a main component of DSP toxins) in gills of P. viridis
   significantly increased at 6 h, but mussels were all apparently healthy
   without death. Among the 28 identified protein spots by MALDI
   TOF/TOF-MS, 12 proteins were up-regulated and 16 were down-regulated in
   the P. lima-exposed mussels. These identified proteins were involved in
   various biological activities, such as metabolism, cytoskeleton, signal
   transduction, response to oxidative stress and detoxification. Taken
   together, our results indicated that the presence of P. lima caused DSP
   toxins accumulation in mussel gill, and might consequently induce
   cytoskeletonal disorganization, oxidative stress, a dysfunction in
   metabolism and ubiquitination/proteasome activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Route of metabolization and detoxication of paralytic shellfish toxins
   in humans},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) are a collection of over 26
   structurally related imidazoline guanidinium derivatives produced by
   marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Glucuronidation of
   drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is the major phase 11
   conjugation reaction in mammalian liver.
   In this study, using human liver microsomes, the in vitro paralytic
   shellfish toxins oxidation and sequential glucuronidation are achieved.
   Neosaxitoxin (neoSTX), Gonyautoxin 3/2 epimers (GTX3/GTX2) and Saxitoxin
   (STX) are used as starting enzymatic substrates. The enzymatic reaction
   final product metabolites are identified by using HPLC-FLD and
   HPLC/ESI-IT/MS. Four metabolites from GTX3/GTX2 epimers precursors,
   three of neoSTX and two of STX are clearly identified after incubating
   with UDPGA/NADPH and fresh liver microsomes. The glucuronic-Paralytic
   Shellfish Toxins were completely hydrolysed by treatment with
   P-glucuronidase. All toxin analogs were identified comparing their HPLC
   retention time with those of analytical standard reference samples and
   further confirmed by HPLC/ESI-IT/MS. Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST)
   were widely metabolized by human microsomes and less than 15\% of the
   original PST, incubated as substrate, stayed behind at the end of the
   incubation.
   The apparent V-max and Km formation values for the respective
   glucuronides of neoSTX, GTX3/GTX2 epimers and STX were determined. The
   V-max formation values for Glucuronic-GTX3 and Glucuronic-GTX2 were
   lower than Glucuronic-neoSTX and Glucuronic-STX (6.8 +/- 1.9 x 10(-3);
   8.3 +/- 2.8 x 10(-3) and 9.7 +/- 2.8 x 10(-3) pmol/min/mg protein
   respectively). Km of the glucuronidation reaction for GTX3/GTX2 epimers
   was less than that of glucuronidation of neoSTX and STX (20.2 +/- 0.12;
   27.06 +/- 0.23 and 32.02 +/- 0.64 mu M respectively). In conclusion,
   these data show for the first time, direct evidence for the sequential
   oxidation and glucuronidation of PST in vitro, both being the initial
   detoxication reactions for the excretion of these toxins in humans. The
   PST oxidation and glucuronidation pathway showed here, is the hepatic
   conversion of its properly glucuronic-PST synthesized, and the
   sequential route of PST detoxication in human. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Dinophysis spp. blooms and related shellfish toxicity events of
   diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) have been the most reported
   toxicity event through the Croatian National monitoring program. With
   the aim to characterize the DSP toxin profile in shellfish farmed in
   Croatia, for the first time a complete analysis of the toxin profile of
   Croatian mussels has been carried out using the LC-MS/MS technique. The
   obtained results showed okadaic acid (OA) as the main toxin
   contaminating Croatian mussels at that time. The maximum concentration
   of OA in shellfish tissue was recorded 12 days after the Dinophysis
   fortii bloom, thus suggesting that rapid growth of the toxin level in
   the shellfish occurred in the first week after the bloom while it was
   slower in the second week. Furthermore, the presence of only OA at
   concentrations which could endanger human health suggests D. fortii as
   the main organism responsible for the toxic event that occurred in Lim
   Bay. The presence of gymnodimine and spirolides in Croatian mussel has
   been detected for the first time, while the presence of yessotoxin and
   pectenotoxin-2 is confirmed.},

Abstract = {Azaspiracid (AZA) producing microalgae have been reported
   internationally and could potentially impact a variety of seafood.
   Scallops (Chlamys farreri) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from
   China were fed with the AZA2 producer, Azadinium poporum, to study
   uptake, metabolism and oxidative stress in the shellfish. LC-MS/MS
   showed significant accumulation and differential metabolism of AZA2 in
   the scallops and mussels. In mussels AZA2 was metabolized to AZA19, with
   subsequent decarboxylation to AZA6. In scallops no AZA19 or AZA6 was
   observed, however, a novel AZA metabolite was formed that is isobaric
   with AZA19 ({[}M+H](1), m/z 886), but elutes at a different retention
   time. In addition it was noted that the scallop metabolite was stable
   during heating, while AZA19 has been shown to decarboxylate.
   Concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activities of
   antioxidant enzymes were monitored. ROS levels increased slightly in the
   meat of scallops and mussels due to starvation in the acclimation and
   depuration periods, but reduced in the feeding periods with non-toxic
   Isocluysis galbana or toxic A. poporum. No obvious variations were found
   in activities for a range of antioxidant enzymes. These results provide
   new insights on the potential for accumulation and metabolism of AZAs in
   bivalve species relevant to this area of China, which is of importance
   considering the recent finding of AZA producing microalgae in the
   region. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium synthesize potent neurotoxins
   known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins. The grazing
   responses of two abundant copepod species from the Gulf of Maine,
   Acartia tonsa and Eurytemora herdmani, were compared using cultured
   isolates of Alexandrium spp,, which differed in toxicity per cell and
   toxin composition and a non-toxic dinoflagellate Lingulodinium
   polyedrum. Additional experiments were performed to determine if
   copepods were incapacitated over time by ingested toxins, or if they
   were capable of avoiding toxic cells by selecting alternative food.
   Toxin analyses were performed by high performance liquid chromatography
   with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) on both dinoflagellate prey and
   copepod consumers, to determine the rate and levels of PSP toxins
   accumulated in copepods. Toxin content (ng saxitoxin equivalents
   {[}STXeq] per individual) and relative composition (\% molar) were used
   to establish whether or not toxin biotransformation and detoxification
   kinetics reflect the ability of these zooplankton to act as vectors of
   PSP toxins in marine food webs,
   Significant differences in grazing rate, behavior, and toxin
   accumulation were found between the two copepod species tested,
   Eurytemora herdmani demonstrated marked selective capabilities,
   unrelated to the toxicity of prey items offered, Neither species showed
   strong evidence of incapacitation or adverse effects from ingested
   toxins. These results suggested that copepods have highly sensitive and
   specific chemoreceptive and selective abilities, and that the effect of
   zooplankton grazing on toxic dinoflagellate blooms will depend on the
   species composition of the grazing community. Although the toxin
   retention efficiencies of copepods tested were low overall, high levels
   of PSP toxin were accumulated in copepod grazers, supporting the
   hypothesis that zooplankton may serve as PSP toxin vectors to higher
   trophic levels.},

   non-brevetoxin-producing strain of the dinoflagellate Karenia
   brevis},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Effects of the toxic Gulf of Mexico dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on its
   copepod grazers are equivocal, in that this dinoflagellate is ingested
   by various copepods, but may be toxic to, and/or nutritionally
   inadequate for grazers. Recent studies have shown that when the
   Mediterranean copepod Calanus helgolandicus fed on K. brevis, egg
   production rates and egg viability declined steadily over time, reaching
   almost zero levels after 5 days of feeding (Turner et al., 2012). The K.
   brevis strain used in that study was chemically analyzed and shown not
   to contain any brevetoxins, but may have contained other harmful
   metabolites. Here we present gene expression analyses by reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in C helgolandicus after
   different exposure times (3, 5 and 8 days) to the same
   non-brevetoxin-containing K. brevis strain examined previously. The
   analyzed genes have a primary role in generic stress responses, defense
   systems (e.g. aldehyde, free fatty acid and free radical detoxification)
   and apoptosis regulation in other organisms. After 3 days of feeding on
   K. brevis, gene expression levels in copepods did not show significant
   changes. However, after 5 days of exposure, expression of
   stress-response genes was significantly reduced. After prolonged
   exposure for 8 days, expression of genes for 5 of 6 aldehyde
   dehydrogenases was strongly reduced, but expression of other genes was
   not coherently reduced, or increased. Microscopic observations revealed
   that after only a single day of feeding on K. brevis, freshly-spawned
   eggs were morphologically similar to those produced by copepods feeding
   on control diets, but after 3 days of feeding on K brevis, eggs
   exhibited altered membrane cell morphology and apoptotic features such
   as granulation and degeneration of the cytoplasm matrix, compared to the
   unaltered eggs produced by copepods feeding on control diets. The
   changes in gene expression levels in copepods feeding on K brevis were
   similar to those noted previously for copepods feeding upon diatoms that
   contained oxylipins, which interfered with copepod reproductive success.
   Changes in gene expression in copepods feeding upon toxic algal diets
   may offer important early warning signals of copepod stress responses to
   these diets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Transfer of microcystin from freshwater lakes to Puget Sound, WA and

Abstract = {Many eutrophic inland freshwater lakes in the Puget Sound Washington
   region produce toxic cyanobacteria blooms annually. While such blooms in
   lakes tend to be viewed as a localized phenomenon, there is significant
   potential for downstream export of toxins to freshwater streams, and
   marine and brackish water environments. However, monitoring for
   cyanotoxins typically associated with freshwaters, such as the
   hepatotoxin, microcystin (MC) in marine receiving waters is rare. In
   2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both
   toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in
   marine shellfish, specifically mussels. Shellfish beds are extensive
   throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of
   our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellfish
   consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We confirm, for
   the first time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with
   subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated
   maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 mu g/L, up to 0.34 mu
   g/L in marine waters and 6.5 mu g/kg in mussels. Confirmatory analyses
   by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identified MC-LA as the major
   toxin. Although we found relatively low MC levels in mussels, our study
   implies that potential concern for human food safety is justified and
   warrants further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Karenia brevis, the harmful alga associated with red tide, produces
   brevetoxins (PbTxs). Exposure to these toxins can have a negative impact
   on marine wildlife and serious human health consequences. The
   elimination of PbTxs is critical to protect the marine environment and
   human health. TiO2 photocatalysis under 350 nm and solar irradiation
   leads to significant degradation of PbTxs via first order kinetics.
   ELISA results demonstrate TiO2 photocatalysis leads to a significant
   decrease in the bioactivity of PbTxs as a function of treatment time.
   Experiments conducted in the presence of synthetic seawater, humic
   material and a hydroxyl scavenger showed decreased degradation. PbTxs
   are highly hydrophobic and partition to organic microlayer on the ocean
   surface. Acetonitrile was employed to probe the influence of an organic
   media on the TiO2 photocatalysis of PbTxs. Our results indicate TiO2
   photocatalysis may be applicable for the degradation of PbTxs. Published

Abstract = {Subaquatic life is in a state of constant mechanical and chemical
   warfare in which the best adapted will survive. In these complex
   interactions, some animals can present structures that will inflict
   trauma, such as teeth, spines, and stings, which can be venomous or not.
   Studies on toxins of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria are expanding,
   and disease outbreaks associated with these toxins are increasing
   globally. These poisonings can occur in an individual (as the paralysis
   for seafood) and in small or large groups (such as the red tides).
   Various marine animals used as food may be contaminated, which broadens
   the spectrum of these poisonings and increases the need for additional
   studies on the activity of these toxins and their mechanisms of action.
   Studies on therapeutic measures and approaches to reduce or eliminate
   the risk in the environment are also needed.
   Injuries caused by sea urchins are common around the world. Some species
   cause severe envenomations, but the majority of these injuries are
   traumatic and not serious. Sea cucumbers can be toxic, and the
   crown-of-thorns starfish is venomous. Additionally, sea worms present
   toxins and bristles that cause skin inflammation and are also
   responsible for painful bites. They are common on the coasts, and the
   clinical manifestations caused by marine worms present similarity with
   injuries caused by marine sponges. Leeches do not cause envenomations
   and rarely are associated with marked manifestation in humans.},

Abstract = {Fish are routinely exposed to harmful algal blooms that produce noxious
   compounds and impact the marine food web. This study investigates the
   role of phase I and II detoxification enzymes on metabolism of the novel
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), the hydroxybenzoate analogues
   recently discovered in Gymnodinium catenatum strains, in the liver of
   white seabream, assessing ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. Additionally, the genotoxic
   potential of hydroxybenzoate PSTs was examined through the erythrocytic
   nuclear abnormality (ENA) assay. Fish were injected with hydroxybenzoate
   PSTs into the coelomic cavity and sacrificed 2 and 6 days later for
   biochemical and cytogenetic analyses. While the activity of EROD was
   unresponsive to toxins, a significant GST activity decrease was observed
   at 2 days after injection indicating an impairment of this line of the
   detoxification system. The genotoxic potential of PSTs was demonstrated
   by the induction of clastogenic/aneugenic effects at 2 days, as measured
   by the ENA assay. Overall, this study contributes to better understand
   the impact of toxins produced by G. catenatum blooms in fish, revealing
   effects that, even transitory, point out a risk associated to
   hydroxybenzoate analogues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal foodborne
   illness, is often diagnosed anecdotally based on symptoms and dietary
   history. The neurotoxins responsible for PSP, collectively referred to
   as the saxitoxins or paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are natural
   toxins, produced by certain dinoflagellates, that may accumulate in
   seafood, particularly filter-feeding bivalves. Illnesses are rare
   because of effective monitoring programs, yet occasional poisonings
   occur. Rarely are contaminated food and human clinical samples (e.g.,
   urine and serum) available for testing. There are currently few methods,
   none of which are validated, for determining PSTs in clinical matrices.
   This study evaluated AOAC (Association of Analytical Communities)
   Official Method of Analysis (OMA) 2005.06. {[}AOAC Official Method

   extension to human urine and serum samples. Initial assessment of
   control urine and serum matrices resulted in a sample cleanup
   modification when working with urine to remove hippuric acid, a natural
   urinary compound of environmental/dietary origin, which co-eluted with
   saxitoxin. Commercially available urine and serum matrices were then
   quantitatively spiked with PSTs that were available as certified
   reference materials (STX, dcSTX, BI, GTX2/3, C1/2, NEO, and GTX1/4) to
   assess method performance characteristics. The method was subsequently
   applied successfully to a PSP case study that occurred in July 2007 in
   Maine. Not only were PSTs identified in the patient urine and serum
   samples, the measured time series also led to the first report of human
   PST-specific urinary elimination rates. The LC-FD data generated from
   this case study compared remarkably well to results obtained using AOAC
   OMA 2011.27 {[}AOAC Official Method 2011.27 Paralytic Shellfish Toxins

   Analysis of AOAC International < http://www.eoma.aoac.org >], further
   demonstrating successful extension of the LC-FD method to these clinical
   matrices. Moreover, data generated from this poisoning event reiterated
   that urine is a preferable clinical matrix, compared to serum, for
   diagnostic purposes due to higher accumulation and longer residence
   times in urine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   excretion. DTX-4 and a selection of DTX-4 diol esters were identified
   using selected ion monitoring, although not all strains produced these
   compounds. Cell size and number of marginal and valve pores of each
   strain were observed using scanning electron microscopy. OA and DTX-1
   concentrations, pigment content and changes in nitrate and phosphate
   concentrations in the culture media were followed during growth of one
   strain of P. lima in batch culture. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)
   toxins have been previously detected in shellfish cultivated in the
   Fleet lagoon, but in the absence of any Dinophysis sp. cells. The
   identification of toxic P. lima strains from the Fleet suggests that
   this dinoflagellate is the most probable source of occasional DSP
   detected in the lagoon. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Seafood poisoning outbreaks are often caused by biotoxins generated by
   harmful algal blooms. Shellfish toxins, mainly derived from
   phytoplankton, cause diarrhea and poisoning in humans who consume
   contaminated seafood. Many studies suggest that diarrheal shellfish
   toxins cause functional changes in various cells. In order to protect
   shellfish products, it is becoming increasingly important to remove
   these contaminants from the ocean. Public attention plays a crucial role
   in reducing the risk of acute intoxication caused by contaminated
   seafood. Monitoring algal toxins is the best way to ensure that seafood
   is safe and clean. In order to attain these objectives, a variety of
   technologies were developed and constructed for the purpose of detecting
   and decontaminating algal toxins in aquatic environments. A review of
   the current literature regarding the detection and detoxification of
   diarrheal shellfish toxins is presented in this article.},

Abstract = {Contamination of shellfish with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)
   toxins readily occurs during algal blooms. Such phenomena raise
   important public health concerns and thus comprise a constant challenge
   to shellfish farmers, the seafood industry and health services,
   considering the increasing occurrence of toxic episodes around the
   world. To avoid the detrimental effects of such episodes, research has
   focused on the use of various detoxification methodologies that should
   be rapid, efficient, easy to apply, and will not alter the quality and
   sensory properties of shellfish. In the present study, both ozonation
   (15 mg kg(-1) for 6 h) and gamma-irradiation (6 kGy) were utilised in
   order to reduce the toxin content of contaminated shucked mussels,
   collected during the DSP episodes of 2007 and 2009 in Greece. DSP
   toxicity was monitored using the mouse bioassay (MBA) whilst the
   determination of toxin content of the okadaic acid (OA) group (both free
   and esterified forms) was carried out by LC/MS/MS analysis. Toxin
   reduction using gamma-irradiation was in the range of 12-36\%, 8-53\%
   and 10-41\% for free OA, OA esters and total OA, respectively. The
   appearance and texture of irradiated mussels deteriorated, pointing to a
   low potential for commercial use of this method. Ozonation of mussels
   resulted in toxin reduction in the range of 6-100\%, 25-83\% and 21-66\%
   for free OA, OA esters and total OA, respectively. Reduction of OA
   content was substantially higher in homogenised mussel tissue compared
   with that of whole shucked mussels. In addition, differences detected
   with regard to quality parameters (TBA, sensory attributes) between
   ozonated and control mussels were not considerable. Even though varying
   percentage reductions in OA and its derivatives were achieved using
   ozonation under specific experimental conditions tested, it is
   postulated that upon optimisation ozonation may have the potential for
   post-harvest commercial DSP detoxification of shucked mussels.},

Abstract = {To investigate the role of detoxification-related liver genes in amnesic
   shellfish poisoning toxin metabolism, red sea bream Pagrus major were
   exposed to domoic acid (DA, 2 mu g g(-1) wet weight) for 24 h. Hepatic
   mRNA expression levels of AHF, ARNT, CYP1 and GSTs were determined by
   semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The cytosolic factors aryl hydrocarbon
   receptor (AHR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)
   mRNA levels of DA exposure group were substantially enhanced by 113.3\%
   and 90.9\%, respectively. Consistent with this result, the phase I
   xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme (XME) cytochrome P-450 1A (CYP1A) was
   significantly induced. In contrast, the transcriptions of three major
   phase If XME glutathione S-transferases as well as heat shock protein 70
   were not significantly affected by DA exposure. These results suggest a
   possible role of CYP1A after DA exposure in the toxin metabolism of
   marine fish, possibly through the AHR/ARNT signaling pathway. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Analytical procedure for environmental and seafood safety monitoring of
   total mercury content, based on the external calibration methodology and
   cold vapor generation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   determination, was validated according to the requirements of
   international guidelines and standards. Marine samples with varying
   levels of mercury: marine biota, marine sediment and costal sea waters
   were used in this study. A full validation approach in line with the
   ISO/IEC 17025 and Eurachem guidelines was followed. With this in mind,
   blanks, selectivity, working range (1.2 ng kg(-1) to 240 ng kg(-1)),
   linearity (0.9991), recovery (97 \% to 103 \%), repeatability (< 2.5
   \%), intermediate precision (< 3.5 \%), limit of detection (0.72 ng
   kg(-1)) and limit of quantification (1.10 ng kg(-1)) were systematically
   assessed. The uncertainty of measurement results was estimated according
   to the recommendations of the Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in
   Measurement. The relative expanded uncertainty was in the range between
   14.2 \% and 15.8 \% (k = 2) for marine biota and sediment samples,
   respectively, and rise up to 32.8 \% (k = 2) on the total mercury mass
   fraction in costal seawater at the level of 5 ng kg(-1). The major
   contribution to the combined uncertainty was found to come from the
   uncertainty associated with the correction for recovery and procedural
   blanks. The performance of validated procedure was demonstrated by its
   application to the low-level Hg content seawater samples, received in
   the frame of Proficiency Testing Scheme, conducted by the Quality
   Assurance of Information in Marine Environment Monitoring in Europe. The
   result for total mercury content in marine sediment IAEA-475 was used as
   the contribution of the IAEA in the characterization campaign of the
   IAEA-475 candidate certified reference material. The demonstrated SI
   traceability of obtained results is a prerequisite for their further
   comparisons with monitoring data obtained in different place and time.},

Abstract = {Perna viridis is a recently introduced species to US coastal waters and
   have vigorously spread throughout the southeastern seaboard since their
   invasion. Little information regarding their response to local
   environmental factors has been reported including responses to the local
   HAB species, Karenia brevis. This study monitored the tissue toxin
   concentration of brevetoxins in P. viridis from existing populations
   throughout two consecutive natural K. brevis blooms. The results showed
   P. viridis to rapidly accumulate PbTx upon exposure to the bloom, far
   exceeding the peak tissue concentrations of oysters, Crassostrea
   virginica, sampled during the same period, 57,653 +/- 15,937 and 33,462
   +/- 10,391 ng g(-1) PbTx-3 equivalent, respectively. Further, P. viridis
   retained high PbTx concentrations in their tissues post bloom remaining
   above the regulatory limit for human consumption for 4-5 months,
   significantly longer than the depuration time of 2-8 weeks for native
   oyster and clam species. In the second year, the bloom persisted at high
   cell concentrations resulting in prolonged exposure and higher PbTx
   tissue concentrations indicating increased bioaccumulation in green
   mussels. While this species is not currently harvested for human
   consumption, the threat for post bloom trophic transfer could pose
   negative impacts on other important fisheries and higher food web
   implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bivalves are a high-value product whose production has markedly
   increased, reaching 9863 tonnes in Portugal in 2021. Bivalves'
   habitats-lagoons, estuaries and coastal waters-are exposed to biological
   and anthropogenic contaminants, which can bioaccumulate in these
   organisms and pose a significant public health risk. The need to obtain
   a safe product for human consumption led to the implementation of
   standardised hygiene regulations for harvesting and marketing bivalve
   molluscs, resulting in routine monitoring of bivalve production areas
   for microbial quality, metal contaminants, and marine biotoxins. While
   excessive levels of biotoxins and metal contamination lead to temporary
   harvesting bans, high faecal contamination leads to area
   reclassification and impose post-harvest treatments. In this study, the
   seasonal and temporal variability of these parameters were analysed
   using historical data generated by the monitoring programme during the
   last decade. Moreover, the impact of the monitoring program on bivalve
   harvesting from 2011 to 2020 was assessed. This program presented a
   considerable improvement over time, with an increase in the sampling
   effort and the overall program representativeness. Finally,
   contamination risk, revising control measures, and defining
   recommendations for risk mitigation measures are given in the light of
   ten years' monitoring.},

Title = {Clearance rates and toxin accumulation by North Atlantic bivalves during
   harmful algal blooms caused by the dinoflagellate, Dinophysis
   acuminata, in estuaries},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is the intoxication syndrome
   derived from the consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins
   produced by algae such as Dinophysis acuminata, yet no study has
   examined the rate at which bivalves feed on this toxigenic species.
   During 2021 and 2022, the clearance rates (CR) of three commercially
   significant bivalve species native to the western North Atlantic
   (Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mytilus edulis) were
   quantified during exposure to D. acuminata blooms of varying densities
   (10(2) - 10(5) cells L-1) at three sites across New York (NY), USA. The
   same bivalve species were deployed at NY sites experiencing Dinophysis
   blooms to track accumulation and depuration rates of diarrhetic
   shellfish toxins (DSTs) and pectenotoxins (PTXs), toxins that are
   harmful to humans or shellfish, respectively. A native, non-commercial
   mussel species (Geukensis demissa) was also sampled in situ to quantify
   toxin accumulation. CR of D. acuminata were greater than
   chlorophyll-a-based-rates for all bivalves and clearance rates of D.
   acuminata by C. virginica (1.69 +/- 1.34 L h(-1) g(-1)) were
   significantly greater than those of M. edulis (0.46 +/- 0.32 L h(-1)
   g(-1)) and M. mercenaria (0.41 +/- 0.24 L h(-1) g(-1); p < 0.05). During
   a bloom event in 2021, C. virginica and M. mercenaria accumulated low
   levels of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), whereas during a more sustained bloom
   in 2022, C. virginica, M. edulis, and G. demissa accumulated
   combinations of DSTs (okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1)),
   PTX2, and pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (PTX2sa) with M. edulis DST loads
   (265 ng OA + DTX1 g(-1) shellfish tissue) exceeding the FDA closure
   guideline (160 ng toxin g(-1)) for three weeks. DST concentrations in M.
   edulis were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than C. virginica and M.
   mercenaria, whereas PTX2 concentrations in C. virginica were
   significantly higher than in all other bivalves (p < 0.05). PTX2sa loads
   in M. edulis and C. virginica were similar to each other and were
   significantly greater than PTX2 loads (p < 0.05). Toxin accumulation
   efficiencies (TAEs) were higher for M. edulis than C. virginica, and
   TAEs for DSTs were higher than for PTX2 and PTX2sa in both species. The
   combination of rapid CR of D. acuminata observed in all bivalves, even
   at >10(5) cells L-1, and the ability of bivalves such as M. edulis to
   rapidly accumulate high levels of DSTs demonstrate these HABs may
   represent a significant DSP threat in North America.},

Title = {Characterisation and toxicological activity of three different
   Pseudo-nitzschia species from the northern Adriatic Sea
   (Croatia)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia are cosmopolitans spread in seas
   and oceans worldwide, with more than 50 described species, dozens of
   which have been confirmed to produce domoic acid (DA). Here, we
   characterized and investigated the toxicological activity of secondary
   metabolites excreted into the growth media of different Pseudo-nitzschia
   species sampled at various locations in the northern Adriatic Sea
   (Croatia) using human blood cells under in vitro conditions. The results
   revealed that three investigated species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia
   were capable of producing DA indicating their toxic potential. Moreover,
   toxicological data suggested all three Pseudo-nitzschia species can
   excrete toxic secondary metabolites into the surrounding media in
   addition to the intracellular pools of DA, raising concerns regarding
   their toxicity and environmental impact. In addition, all three
   Pseudo-nitzchia species triggered oxidative stress, one of the
   mechanisms of action likely responsible for the DNA damage observed in
   human blood cells. In line with the above stated, our results are of
   great interest to environmental toxicologists, the public and policy
   makers, especially in light of today's climate change, which favours
   harmful algal blooms and the growth of DA producers with a presumed
   negative impact on the public health of coastal residents.},

Abstract = {We have used protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors and rat cerebellar
   glial cells in primary culture to investigate the role of PP activity in
   the ability of glial cells to detoxify exogenously applied hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2). The marine toxin okadaic acid (OKA), a potent PP1 and
   PP2A inhibitor, caused a concentration-dependent degeneration of
   astrocytes and increased the formation of hydroperoxide radicals
   significantly. Subtoxic exposures to OKA significantly potentiated
   toxicity by exogenous H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 that reduced by
   50\% the survival of astrocytes after 3 h was estimated at 720 +/- 40 mu
   M in the absence and 85 +/- 30 mu M in the presence of the toxin. The PP
   inhibitors calyculin A and endothall also potentiated H2O2 toxicity in
   cerebellar astrocytes. OKA caused a time-dependent inhibition of both
   glial catalase and glutathione peroxidase, reducing by similar to 50\%
   the activity of these enzymes after 3 h, whereas other enzymatic
   activities remained unaffected. Also, OKA reduced the cellular content
   of total glutathione and elevated oxidized glutathione to about 25\% of
   total glutathione. OKA-treated astrocytes cleared H2O2 from the
   incubation medium approximately two times more slowly than control
   cultures. Our results suggest a prominent role for PP activity in the
   antioxidant mechanisms protecting astrocytes against damage by H2O2. (C)

Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTXs) are produced by dinoflagellates usually present in
   tropical and subtropical waters. These toxins are bioaccumulated and
   transformed in fish causing ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) in humans.
   Few trials have been performed to understand how CTXs are incorporated
   into fish. This study developed an experimental model of goldfish
   (Carassius auratus) fed flesh contaminated with Caribbean ciguatoxin
   (C-CTX1). Fourteen goldfish were fed 0.014 ng CTX1B (Eq. g(-1) of body
   weight) daily, and control goldfish received non-toxic flesh. CTX
   presence was determined by a cell-based assay on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36,
   43, and 84. Toxicity was detected in muscle from the second sampling and
   then seemed to stabilize at similar to 0.03 ng CTX1B Eq. g(-1). After
   two weeks, all experimental goldfish developed lethargy and loss of
   brightness, but only two of them displayed erratic swimming and jerking
   movements near the sixth sampling. One of these fish had its toxic diet
   replaced by commercial food for 60 more days; the fish showed recovery
   signs within the first weeks and no CTX activity was detected. These
   results indicate that C-CTX1 could accumulate in goldfish muscle tissue
   and produce toxic symptoms, but also remarked on the detoxification and
   recovery capacity of this species.},

Title = {Tissue Distribution of Amino Acid- and Lipid-Brevetoxins after

Journal = {CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY},

Abstract = {Brevetoxins produced during algal blooms of the dinoflagellate Karenia
   are metabolized by shellfish into reduction, oxidation, and conjugation
   products. Brevetoxin metabolites comprising amino acid- and lipid
   conjugates account for a large proportion of the toxicity associated
   with the consumption of toxic shellfish. However, the disposition of
   these brevetoxin metabolites has not been established. Using intravenous
   exposure to C57BL/6 mice, we investigated the disposition in the body of
   three radiolabeled brevetoxin metabolites. Amino acid brevetoxin
   conjugates represented by S-desoxy-BTX-B2 (cysteine-BTX-B) and lipid
   brevetoxin conjugates represented by N-palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2 were
   compared to dihydro-BTX-B. Tissue concentration profiles were unique to
   each of the brevetoxin metabolites tested, with dihydro-BTX-B being
   widely distributed to all tissues, S-desoxy-BTX-B2 concentrated in
   kidney, and N-palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2 having the highest
   concentrations in spleen, liver, and lung. Elimination patterns were
   also unique: dihydro-BTX-B had a greater fecal versus urinary
   elimination, whereas urine was a more important elimination route for
   S-desoxy-BTX-B2, and N-palmitoyl-S-desoxy-BTX-B2 persisted in tissues
   and was eliminated equally in both urine and feces. The structures
   particular to each brevetoxin metabolite resulting from the reduction,
   amino acid conjugation, or fatty acid addition of BTX-B were likely
   responsible for these tissue-specific distributions and unique
   elimination patterns. These observed differences provide further insight
   into the contribution each brevetoxin metabolite class has to the
   observed potencies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of
   biotransformation of paralytic shellfish toxins during the
   detoxification process in contaminated oysters. Mathematical models
   based upon the detoxification patterns of digestive gland and other
   tissues were developed. It was demonstrated that biotransformations do
   not seem to play an important role in digestive gland or other tissue
   detoxification kinetics with our data set. Moreover, different toxin
   transfers from digestive gland toward other tissues were investigated.
   No significant transfer was highlighted in our data set. These first
   conclusions were drawn after comparing the results obtained from 13
   biotransformations and identifiable transfer scenarios. Finally, to
   determine a more robust model, all 12 states corresponding to toxic
   compounds and tissues were aggregated into a single state model. The
   best adjustment was obtained with a simple one-compartment model based
   on total flesh toxicity with elimination rate expressed by a function
   depending on initial concentrations of GTX3 and GTX2 (i.e. the two major
   toxic compounds found in contaminated oysters). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Toxin profiles were determined in phytoplankton cell concentrates and
   Greenshell Mussels (Perna canaliculus) exposed to a dinoflagellate bloom
   dominated by Dinophysis acuta and Protoceratium reticulatum, This was
   achieved by using a method for the simultaneous identification and
   quantification of a variety of micro-algal toxins by liquid
   chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray
   ionisation (+/-) and monitoring of daughter ions in multiple reaction
   modes. Plankton concentrates and shellfish contained high levels of
   yessotoxins (YTXs) and pectenotoxins (PTXs) and low levels of okadaic
   acid (OA). A high proportion (> 87\%) of the OA in both plankton and
   shellfish was released by alkaline hydrolysis. An isomer of pectenotoxin
   1 (PTX1i) was nearly as abundant as pectenotoxin 2 (PTX2) in the
   plankton and shellfish, and the latter contained high levels of their
   respective seco acids. DTX1 DTX2, and PTX6 were not detected. MS-MS
   experiments revealed that the shellfish contained several other
   oxygenated metabolites of YTX in addition to 45-hydroxy yessotoxin
   (45OH-YTX). Gymnodimine (GYM) was present in the shellfish but not
   plankton and it was probably the residue from a previous GYM
   contamination event. Unlike the other toxins, GYM was concentrated in
   tissues outside the digestive gland and levels did not decrease over 5
   months. The depuration rates of YTX and PTXs from mussels were modelled.

Abstract = {Some phytoplankton species can produce biotoxins. As molluscan shellfish
   filter-feed on these toxic species, they bioaccumulate the phycotoxins,
   which can be transferred to higher trophic levels, resulting in several
   types of poisoning syndromes. The main shellfish-mediated,
   phycotoxin-associated, human poisoning syndromes are paralytic, amnesic,
   neurotoxic, diarrheic and azaspirazid shellfish poisonings; a few other
   phytoplankton species can also cause harmful effects in humans. This
   chapter lists the major phycotoxins described, their origins,
   occurrences, and impact on human health as well as management procedures
   developed to address them. The trophic dynamics of the phycotoxins are
   also discussed, as is their bioaccumulation, biotransformation, and

Abstract = {Harmful algal bloom events caused by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis
   occurred along the central west Florida, USA, coast from February 2005
   through December 2005 and from August 2006 through December 2006. During
   these events, from 4 February 2005 through 28 November 2006, live,
   debilitated seabirds admitted for rehabilitation showed clinical signs
   that included disorientation, inability to stand, ataxia, and seizures.
   Testing of blood, biologic fluids, and tissues for brevetoxin by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay found toxin present in 69\% (n = 95)
   of rehabilitating seabirds. Twelve of the 19 species of birds had
   evidence of brevetoxin exposure. Commonly affected species included
   Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), Brown Pelicans
   (Pelecanus occidentalis), Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias), and Common
   Loons (Gavia immer). Serial blood and fecal samples taken from several
   live seabirds during rehabilitation showed that brevetoxin was cleared
   within 5-10 days after being admitted to the rehabilitation facility,
   depending on the species tested. Among seabirds that died or were
   euthanized, the highest brevetoxin concentrations were found in bile,
   stomach contents, and liver. Most dead birds had no significant
   pathologic findings at necropsy, thereby supporting brevetoxin-related
   mortality.},

Abstract = {Comparatively little is known about paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)
   accumulation by marine grazers, yet recurrent blooms of Alexandrium
   catenella have caused repeated closures of wild fisheries and require
   ongoing monitoring. To determine if the commercially harvested
   periwinkle Lunella undulata is at risk of PST uptake, a laboratory
   experiment was conducted exposing the herbivorous/detritovorous marine
   snails to either live or senescent Alexandrium catenella microalgae.
   After 21 days of exposure, the highest PST concentrations were observed
   in the viscera of animals in the senescent and live algal treatments
   (0.55+0.08 and 0.82+0.12 mg STX.2HCl eq./kg, respectively). No
   quantifiable PST was observed in the foot of animals from either
   exposure treatment. The PST profile in the viscera closely matched that
   of the microalgal source, suggesting PST uptake through direct grazing
   of L. undulata on vegetative A. catenella cells. Grazing activity
   remained unchanged throughout the exposure period across all treatments.
   However, periwinkles exposed to A. catenella were significantly slower
   to retract their foot in response to touch than those animals in the
   control treatment (first observed on days 7 and 11 in the dead and live
   algae treatments, respectively). This effect became more pronounced over
   time and coincided with higher PST concentrations. While righting speed
   did not differ between animals exposed to live microalgae and the
   control, those exposed to senescent algae were generally slower to right
   (observed from day 4 onwards). The implications of these findings for
   biotoxin management in periwinkles and related marine grazers are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The analytical procedure for reference measurements of Hg in marine
   environmental samples based on cold vapour generation (CVG) inductively
   coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS) and isotope
   dilution calibration strategy (ID) is described in the present study.
   The procedure was applied on different matrices and varying mass
   fractions for mercury in oyster, marine sediment and costal seawater
   samples. The use of CVG for sample introduction resulted in sensitivity
   enhancement, reduction of blank levels, minimization of matrix
   interferences and the elimination of memory effects. The entire
   measurement process was described by mathematical equations, and all
   factors influencing the final results were systematically investigated.
   The expanded uncertainty on results was estimated following the
   ISO/Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement guidelines,
   and all major contributions were identified. Modelling of the entire
   measurement process and the use of primary method of measurements ID
   ICP-MS related obtained values for total mercury in different types of
   marine matrices to the international system of units SI. Obtained
   results for mercury mass fractions in biota and marine sediments were
   used as the International Atomic Energy Agency's contribution in the
   certification campaigns for marine reference materials and were in
   excellent agreement with the assigned reference values.},

Journal = {TOXICON},

Number = {1},
Pages = {91-100},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bacteria isolated from the digestive tracts of blue mussels (Mytilus
   edulis) contaminated with paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were
   screened for the ability to reduce the toxicity of a PST mixture in
   vitro. Bacteria were isolated on marine agar and grown in marine broth
   supplemented with a mussel extract and an algal extract containing PSTs
   (saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, gonyautoxins 2 and 3, decarbamoyl-gonyautoxins
   2 and 3 and C1/C2 toxins). Toxin levels were measured before and after 5
   d of incubation, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   reduction of overall toxicity verified by mouse bioassays. Of the 73
   bacterial cultures screened, seven isolates were designated
   ``competent{''} PST degraders, individually reducing the overall
   toxicity of the PSTs by at least 90\% within 3 d. Most isolates degraded
   100\% of the saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin within 1-3 d. In all cases, the
   overall kinetics of degradation of the toxicities was first order, as
   were the individual degradation kinetics of most of the individual
   toxins. This is the first report of nearly complete elimination of PSTs
   through bacterial action and may perhaps result in the development of a
   practical means to eliminate or reduce the risk of PSP intoxication
   associated with shellfish consumption. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Plastic contamination is a major issue for marine ecosystems, with
   macro-litter posing a growing threat globally. This study assesses
   macro-marine litter on Vung Tau beaches, Southern Vietnam, providing

   and 83.3 \% as ``Moderate,{''} while the Plastic Abundance Index (PAI)
   revealed 91.7 \% of sites had ``Moderate{''} plastic levels. Human
   activities, such as tourism and insufficient waste management, were key
   contributors. Addressing this issue requires raising awareness,
   promoting behavioural change and tourist perceptions, and enhancing
   waste management efforts. Prioritizing marine protection programs is
   crucial for effectively eliminating marine litter and plastic waste.},

Title = {Clearance rates and diarrhetic shellfish toxin accumulation by North
   Atlantic bivalves fed on North American strains of Dinophysis
   acuminata},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {213},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Filter feeding bivalves exposed to the harmful algal bloom (HAB) genus,
   Dinophysis, become intoxicated by the uptake of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins (DSTs) produced by these phytoplankton. Here, three species of
   bivalve (Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mytilus
   edulis) native to the western North Atlantic were exposed to two North
   American strains of toxigenic Dinophysis acuminata to assess the impacts
   of cell density, cell density as a fraction of the total plankton
   community, and differing Dinophysis prey (i.e. strains of the ciliate,
   Mesodinium rubrum) on bivalve clearance rates. All bivalves cleared D.
   acuminata faster when the dinoflagellate was offered at moderate
   densities (10,000 cells L-1) as compared to high densities (100,000
   cells L-1). C. virginica cleared a more toxic Massachusetts strain of D.
   acuminata significantly faster than a less toxic New York strain (p <
   0.05). When presented with Dinophysis in mixed culture with the non-HAB
   species, Rhodomonas salina, in varying proportions, C. virginica
   clearance rates slowed significantly as the relative and absolute
   abundance of D. acuminata increased (p < 0.05), whereas M. edulis
   displayed a preference for the algae that was more abundant. While C.
   virginica and M. edulis cleared R. salina significantly faster than M.
   mercenaria (p < 0.05), there were no differences in the clearance rates
   of D. acuminata among bivalves. In an additional experiment where M.
   edulis was exposed to a constant, density (similar to 15,000 cells L-1)
   of D. acuminata for 36 h and then fed a non-toxic food source for 24 h
   to quantify toxin accumulation and depuration, mussels rapidly
   accumulated DSTs and pectenotoxins (PTXs) during exposure to Dinophysis
   but depurated PTXs at a rate 3-14 times faster than DSTs (p = 0.07).
   Collectively, this study demonstrates that the accumulation of DSTs in
   bivalves varies as a function of D. acuminata density, species, and
   strain, and that feeding characteristics of, and toxin dynamics within,
   M. edulis make it more vulnerable to DST accumulation than C. virginica
   and a likely DST vector in bloomprone regions.},

Title = {Diversity and regional distribution of harmful algal events along the
   Atlantic margin of Europe},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {SI},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The IOC-ICES-PICES Harmful Algal Event Database (HAEDAT) was used to
   describe the diversity and spatiotemporal distribution of harmful algal
   events along the Atlantic margin of Europe from 1987 -2018. The majority
   of events recorded are caused by Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DSTs).
   These events are recorded annually over a wide geographic area from
   southern Spain to northern Scotland and Iceland, and are responsible for
   annual closures of many shellfish harvesting areas. The dominant
   causative dinoflagellates, members of the morphospecies `Dinophysis
   acuminata complex' and D. acuta, are common in the waters of the
   majority of countries affected. There are regional differences in the
   causative species associated with PST events; the coasts of Spain and
   Portugal with the dinoflagellates Alexandrium minutum and Gymnodinium
   catenatum, north west France/south west England/south Ireland with A.
   minutum, and Scotland/Faroe Islands/Iceland with A. catenella. This can
   influence the duration and spatial scale of PST events as well as the
   toxicity of shellfish. The diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis is the most
   widespread Domoic Acid (DA) producer, with records coming from Spain,
   Portugal, France, Ireland and the UK. Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (ASTs)
   have caused prolonged closures for the scallop fishing industry due to
   the slow depuration rate of DA. Amendments to EU shellfish hygiene
   regulations introduced between 2002 and 2005 facilitated end-product
   testing and sale of adductor muscle. This reduced the impact of ASTs on
   the scallop fishing industry and thus the number of recorded HAEDAT
   events. Azaspiracids (AZAs) are the most recent toxin group responsible
   for events to be characterised in the ICES area. Events associated with
   AZAs have a discrete distribution with the majority recorded along the
   west coast of Ireland. Ciguatera Poisoning (CP) has been an emerging
   issue in the Canary Islands and Madeira since 2004. The majority of
   aquaculture and wild fish mortality events are associated with blooms of
   the dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi and raphidophyte Heterosigma
   akashiwo. Such fish killing events occur infrequently yet can cause
   significant mortalities. Interannual variability was observed in the
   annual number of HAEDAT areas with events associated with individual
   shellfish toxin groups. HABs represent a continued risk for the
   aquaculture industry along the Atlantic margin of Europe and should be
   accounted for when considering expansion of the industry or operational
   shifts to offshore areas.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {In the Gulf of Maine, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus co-occurs with
   the neurotoxin-producing dinoflagellate, Alexandrium fundyense. The
   copepod is resistant to this toxic alga, but little is known about other
   effects. Gene expression profiles were used to investigate the
   physiological response of females feeding for two and five days on a
   control diet or a diet containing either a low or a high dose of A.
   fundyense. The physiological responses to the two experimental diets
   were similar, but changed between the time points. At 5-days the
   response was characterized by down-regulated genes involved in energy
   metabolism. Detoxification was not a major component of the response.
   Instead, genes involved in digestion were consistently regulated,
   suggesting that food assimilation may have been affected. Thus,
   predicted increases in the frequency of blooms of A. fundyense could
   affect C. finmarchicus populations by changing the individuals' energy
   budget and reducing their ability to build lipid reserves.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {99},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Several species of crabs are resistant to paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs) and/or pufferfish toxin, tetrodotoxin, regardless of toxification
   by the toxins. The shore crab Thalamita crenata, which inhabits Leizhou
   Peninsula, China, is tolerant to PST toxicity, and the hemolymph has
   neutralizing effects against the lethal activity of PST. In the present
   study, we investigated the PST neutralizing factors in the hemolymph
   from T. crenata and successfully separated PST-binding proteins by
   PST-ligand affinity chromatography. The neutralization factors, obtained
   in the fraction with a molecular weight over 10 kDa by ultrafiltration,
   were susceptible to proteases such as alcalase, animal complex
   proteases, pancreatin, and papain. The PST-binding protein had high
   dose-dependent neutralization effects on PST toxicity. The PST-binding
   activity of the protein was stable at 25 degrees C and then decreased
   with an increase in temperature; heating at 65 degrees C for 60 min
   eliminated the initial activity by two-thirds. The PST-binding activity
   was strongly inhibited in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, but not Na+ and
   K+. The PST-binding capability of the protein differed among PST
   components in descending order of neosaxitoxin, gonyautoxins 1 and 4,
   saxitoxin, and gonyautoxins 2 and 3, suggesting a structure activity
   relationship in PST binding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Temperature effects on kinetics of paralytic shellfish toxin elimination
   in Atlantic surfclams, Spisula solidissima},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {308-317},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Surfclams, Spisula solidissima, pose a particular health risk for human
   consumption as they are characterized by accumulation of extremely high
   levels of toxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP),
   slow toxin elimination and an extremely high post-ingestive capacity for
   toxin bioconversion. Surfclam populations experience a wide range of
   temperatures along the NW Atlantic continental shelf, and are undergoing
   range contraction that has been attributed to global warming. In this
   study the influence of temperature (5, 12 and 21 degrees C) on
   detoxification kinetics of individual PSP toxins in two tissue
   compartments of juvenile surfclams (similar to 35 mm shell length) was
   determined under controlled laboratory conditions, over prolonged (2.4
   months) depuration. Clams were toxified with a representative regional
   Gulf of Maine isolate of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense of
   known toxin profile, allowing tracking of changes in toxin composition
   and calculated toxicity in surfclam tissues. The visceral mass
   detoxified at all temperatures, although toxin loss rate increased with
   increasing temperature. In contrast, total toxin content and calculated
   toxicities in other tissues remained constant or even increased during
   depuration, suggesting a physiological or biochemical toxin-retention
   mechanism in this tissue pool and temperature-independent
   detoxification. In vivo toxin compositional changes in surfclam tissues
   found in this study provide evidence of specific toxin conversion
   pathways, involving both reductive and decarbamoylation pathways. We
   conclude that such toxin biotransformations, especially in non-visceral
   tissues, may introduce a discrepancy in describing kinetics of total
   toxicity (in saxitoxin equivalents {[}STXeq]) of S. solidissima over
   prolonged detoxification. Nevertheless, use of total toxicity values
   generated by routine regulatory monitoring based upon mouse bioassays or
   calculated from chemical analytical determination of molar toxin
   concentrations is adequate for first-order modeling of toxin kinetics in
   this species. Furthermore, the differential detoxification response of
   viscera and other tissues in relation to temperature emphasizes the need
   for two-compartment modeling to describe the fate of PSP toxins in this
   species. Finally, key parameters were identified that may prove useful
   in hindcasting the timing of toxic blooms or new toxin input in deep
   offshore waters where routine monitoring of toxic phytoplankton is
   impractical. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Brevetoxin uptake and elimination were examined in Eastern oyster
   (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to recurring blooms of the marine alga
   Karenia brevis in Sarasota Bay, FL, over a three-year period.
   Brevetoxins were monitored by in vitro assays (ELISA, cytotoxicity
   assay, and receptor binding assay) and LC-MS, with in vivo toxicity of
   shellfish extracts assessed by the traditional mouse bioassay.
   Measurements by all methods reflected well the progression and magnitude
   of the blooms. Highest levels recorded by mouse bioassay at bloom peak
   were 157 MU/100 g. Oysters were toxic by Mouse bioassay at levels 20
   MU/100 g for up to two weeks after bloom dissipation, whereas
   brevetoxins were measurable by in vitro assays and LC-MS for several
   months afterwards. For the structure-based methods, summed values for
   the principal brevetoxin metabolites of PbTx-2 (cysteine and cysteine
   sulfoxide conjugates), as determined by LC-MS, were highly correlated
   (r(2) = 0.90) with composite toxin measurements by ELISA. ELISA and
   LC-MS values also correlated well (r(2) = 0.74 and 0.73, respectively)
   with those of mouse bioassay. Pharmacology-based cytotoxicity and
   receptor binding assays did not correlate as well (r(2) = 0.65), and
   were weakly correlated with mouse bioassay (r(2) = 0.48 and 0.50,
   respectively). ELISA and LC-MS methods offer rapid screening and
   confirmation, respectively, of brevetoxin contamination in the oyster,
   and are excellent alternatives to mouse bioassay for assessing oyster
   toxicity following K. brevis blooms. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Microcystin contamination of shellfish along the freshwater-to-marine
   continuum within US mid-Atlantic and Northeast estuaries},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {145},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems that are an important habitat for
   bivalves. The freshwater bodies that discharge into estuaries can
   introduce cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins that may accumulate within food
   webs. Microcystin is a hepatotoxin that causes adverse health effects in
   humans and can be harmful to terrestrial and aquatic organisms.
   Microcystin has been detected in marine bivalves and the rate of
   microcystin accumulation and depuration differs between bivalve species.
   No study has explored the presence or dynamics of microcystins in
   bivalves in the Northeast US, where they represent a major fishery. This
   study quantified levels of microcystins in wild and cultured bivalves as
   a time series from 2017 to 2021 in three of the largest US East Coast
   estuaries (Chesapeake Bay, the Hudson River Estuary, and Long Island
   Sound) that have hosted microcystin-producing cyanobacterial harmful
   algal blooms (CHABs) within their watersheds. During this study,
   microcystins were rarely detected in bivalves across Chesapeake Bay but
   were commonly quantified in multiple bivalve species in the Hudson River
   estuary and within two harbors of Long Island Sound, Stony Brook Harbor
   and Conscience Bay. Microcystins were detected in clams (Mercenaria
   mercenaria and Corbicula fluminea), Eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica), and mussels (Mytilus edulis and Geukensia demissa). Eastern
   oysters (C. virginica) had significantly higher levels of microcystin
   than other bivalve species (p < 0.05) and often contained microcystin
   even when other bivalves sampled concurrently did not, suggesting
   oysters may be a vector for hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning in
   estuaries. Microcystins were detected in oysters even in fall months
   after water column cyanobacterial biomass and microcystins had decreased
   to low levels, suggesting toxin depuration slows during colder months.
   Collectively, this study demonstrates that microcystin accumulation in
   estuarine bivalves, particularly Eastern oysters (C. virginica), occurs
   within several of the larger US East Coast estuaries and could represent
   a public health risk.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms cause important economical losses due to the
   accumulation of toxins in shellfish. Natural detoxification occurs but
   this mechanism is very slow in most cases. The achievement of a method
   for the rapid detoxification of commercial bivalves would be very
   interesting for the shellfish harvesting sector in order to diminish
   economical losses due to harvesting areas closure. In this work, four
   different methods easily applicable in the food industry (freezing,
   evisceration, ozonization and thermal processing) were studied to gain
   the detoxification of four species of bivalves (mussels, scallops, clams
   and cockles) contaminated with the three main types of toxins (ASP, DSP,
   PSP). Results show that for ASP a significant decrease of the toxin
   levels below the legal limit (20 mu g/g) is achieved by using
   hepatopancreas ablation or combination of simple steps (evisceration
   and/or thermal processing/and or freezing). In our hands, PSP toxin
   levels are sharply decreased under the limit of detection (35 mu g STX
   eq/100g) after a thermal processing, inducing percentages of
   detoxification higher than 50\%. The effect of freezing on the levels of
   PSP is very dependent on the matrix studied. DSP toxins are not
   significantly reduced with none of these methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Warm temperature acclimation impacts metabolism of paralytic shellfish

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3402-3413},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species of Alexandrium produce potent neurotoxins termed paralytic
   shellfish toxins and are expanding their ranges worldwide, concurrent
   with increases in sea surface temperature. The metabolism of molluscs is
   temperature dependent, and increases in ocean temperature may influence
   both the abundance and distribution of Alexandrium and the dynamics of
   toxin uptake and depuration in shellfish. Here, we conducted a
   large-scale study of the effect of temperature on the uptake and
   depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins in three commercial oysters
   (Saccostrea glomerata and diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas, n =
   252 per species/ploidy level). Oysters were acclimated to two constant
   temperatures, reflecting current and predicted climate scenarios (22 and
   27 degrees C), and fed a diet including the paralytic shellfish
   toxin-producing species Alexandrium minutum. While the oysters fed on A.
   minutum in similar quantities, concentrations of the toxin analogue
   GTX1,4 were significantly lower in warm-acclimated S. glomerata and
   diploid C. gigas after 12 days. Following exposure to A. minutum,
   toxicity of triploid C. gigas was not affected by temperature.
   Generally, detoxification rates were reduced in warm-acclimated oysters.
   The routine metabolism of the oysters was not affected by the toxins,
   but a significant effect was found at a cellular level in diploid C.
   gigas. The increasing incidences of Alexandrium blooms worldwide are a
   challenge for shellfish food safety regulation. Our findings indicate
   that rising ocean temperatures may reduce paralytic shellfish toxin
   accumulation in two of the three oyster types; however, they may persist
   for longer periods in oyster tissue.},

Title = {New insights into the occurrence of paralytic shellfish toxins in the
   oceanic pufferfish Lagocephalus lagocephalus (Linnaeus, 1758)
   from Madeira Island, Portugal},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pufferfish are some of the most poisonous marine organisms due to their
   capability to accumulate potent neurotoxins such as tetrodotoxins (TTXs)
   and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). Several species are consumed,
   mainly in Asiatic countries, for the quality of their flesh, which may
   cause severe human poisoning every year due to errors in preparation.
   Lagocephalus lagocephalus the oceanic pufferfish, is a cosmopolitan
   species present in European Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Although
   considered toxic, only a few studies have previously addressed the
   occurrence of toxic compounds in this species. In the present study, 29
   individuals of L. lagocephalus caught in Madeira Island (NE Atlantic)
   were dissected and analysed by HPLC-FLD for PSTs detection. Saxitoxin
   (STX) and decarbamoyl STX (dcSTX) were detected in liver, intestine and
   gonads but not in the muscle. Neosaxitoxin (NEO) could also be detected
   in a liver sample. The total STX equivalent (eq) concentrations in liver
   ranged from < LOQ to 973.4 mu g STX eq kg-1. The presence of toxins in
   the intestines and gonads points to the fish capability to acquire
   toxins through feeding or by association with endosymbiotic,
   toxin-producing microbes as well as the ability to accumulate them in
   specific organs. Although pufferfish trade in Europe is forbidden by
   European Union regulations, the increasing occurrence of this species in
   new areas and the expected raise of blooms of PSTs-producer organisms
   claims for a better knowledge on oceanic pufferfish toxicity and
   biology. This will be needed to provide accurate information to
   stakeholders and population to prevent illegal trade of these species
   and poisoning incidents. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An enantioselective route to the marine toxin (+)-acetoxycrenulide is
   described. The early stages of the synthesis feature the conversion of
   (R)-citronellol into a butenolide whose sole stereogenic center is
   provided by the terpenic alcohol. Three contiguous chiral carbon atoms
   are subsequently set in the requisite absolute configuration by
   conjugate addition of an enantiopure allylphosphonamide reagent. The
   resulting product is transformed during several steps into a primary
   selenoxide whose thermal activation in dimethylacetamide at 220 degrees
   C promotes sequential 1,2-elimination and Claisen rearrangement. The
   cyclooctenone core of the target is formed in this step. The final
   stages of the synthesis involve a series of fully stereoselective
   reactions including Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation and controlled
   Dibal-H reduction. The naturally occurring dextrorotatory enantiomer of
   acetoxycrenulide was ultimately acquired.},

Abstract = {Water pollution represents a threat of increasing importance to human
   health. Bivalve mollusks are filter-feeding organisms that can
   accumulate chemical and microbiological contaminants in their tissues
   from very low concentrations in the water or sediments. Consumption of
   contaminated shellfish is one of the main causes of seafood poisoning.
   Thus, marine bivalves are normally depurated in sterilized seawater for
   48 h to allow the removal of bacteria. However, this depuration time
   might be insufficient to eliminate chemical contaminants from their
   tissues. We have developed a novel technology that accelerates up to
   fourfold the excretion rate of xenobiotics in bivalves by treatment with
   the antioxidant and glutathione (GSH) pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
   during the depuration period. NAC improved dose-dependently the
   detoxification of the organophosphate (OP) pesticide fenitrothion in the
   mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, diminishing its levels up to nearly a
   hundred fold compared to conventional depuration, by enhancing the
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and inducing the GSH anabolism
   (GSH synthesis and reduction by glutathione reductase). Notably, this
   induction in GSH anabolism and GST activity was also observed in
   uncontaminated bivalves treated with NAC. As the GSH pathway is involved
   in the detoxification of many pollutants and biotoxins from harmful
   algal blooms, we validated this proof of principle in king scallops
   (Pecten maximus) that naturally accumulated the amnesic shellfish
   poisoning (ASP) toxin domoic acid. We illustrate here a method that
   enhances the elimination of organic contaminants in shellfish, opening
   new avenues of depuration of marine organisms. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {For the first time the potential of Noctiluca scintillans, a non-toxic
   mixotrophic dinoflagellate, in bioconverting and/or excreting saxitoxin
   has been illustrated, thus contributing to the limited knowledge on the
   aspects of toxin pathways in the food chain/web and predator-prey
   preferences. Noctiluca growth rate increased with higher Pyrodinium
   concentration but the ratio of Noctiluca to Pyrodinium should at least
   be 1:250 cells per mL. Noctiluca fed with Pyrodinium alone was found to
   decrease in number suggesting that the nutrients from this prey were
   insufficient. This was confirmed by the improved cell density of
   Noctiluca upon addition of 0.01\% casitone to the Pyrodinium-fed
   Noctiluca. The alternative prey (Gymnodinium sanguineum) slowed down the
   grazing impact of Noctiluca on Pyrodinium. Noctiluca depleted
   Gymnodinium earlier than Pyrodinium showing preference over a prey with
   less saxitoxin. After the feeding experiments, total saxitoxin levels
   decreased to 72\% in the Noctiluca-Pyrodinium setup whereas no saxitoxin
   was detected in the Noctiluca culture fed with Pyrodinium and G.
   sanguineum. It is possible that Gymnodinium can provide some nutrients
   needed to make Noctiluca more efficient in bioconverting saxitoxin. (C)

Title = {Transformation and Depuration o f Paralytic Shellfish Toxins in the
   Geoduck Clam Panopea globosa From the Northern Gulf of California},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {In January 2015, a harmful algae bloom (HAB) of the dinoflagellate
   Gymnodinium catenatum occurred in the Northern Gulf of California (NGC).
   This species produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), a group of
   potent neurotoxins. The harvesting and commercialization of geoduck
   Panopea globose are important economic activities in this region and
   were prohibited for several months due to the accumulation of PSTs in
   clam tissues. We analyzed PSTs concentrations in P globose collected on
   a weekly basis during 2015 near San Felipe, Baja California. The aim of
   the study was to evaluate the transformation and depuration
   characteristics of PSTs in different geoduck tissues. The PST content
   was evaluated in the visceral mass and in the siphon by high-performance
   liquid chromatography with post-column oxidation (HPLCPCOX).
   Additionally, 10 selected samples were analyzed by hydrophilic
   interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
   (HILIC-MS/MS). Toxicity in all siphon samples was lower than the
   regulatory limit (RL) for PSTs of 800 mu g STX eq kg(-1) . In contrast,
   the maximum toxicity of 16,740 mu g STX eq kg(-1) detected in the
   visceral mass exceeded 21 times the RL and it took 210 days to reach
   values below 800 mu g STX eq kg(-1) . Therefore, P globose can be
   considered a slow detoxifier bivalve with a depuration rate of 4.3\%
   day(-1) (calculated by an exponential decay model; R-2 = 0.80). The
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins Cl and 2 were the most abundant analogs in the
   siphon and viscera samples collected close to the HAB occurrence. The
   concentration of these analogs decreased and GTX5 and more toxic analogs
   such as dcGTX2 and dcSTX were detected. M-type analogs were detected by
   HIUC-MS/MS and represented up to 75\% of total PSTs in some samples.
   M-type analogs contributed to 48\% of toxicity estimated in the sample.
   We report for the first time the depuration rate, PSTs profile, and its
   change over time in P globlosa. This information is essential to
   characterize the metabolism of toxins in this economically important
   bivalve but also to develop management plans for fisheries if the
   organism is going to be recurrently exposed to PSTs producing blooms, as
   seems the case for the NGC.},

Abstract = {The presence of Norovirus (NoV) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in
   non-depurated and depurated oysters raised in the north-west Italian
   coast was investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total and
   inorganic arsenic (As) and the presence of marine biotoxins (DSP, ASP,
   PSP) by LC-MS were also investigated. NoV was detected through all the
   sampling period in non depurated and depurated oysters with highest
   levels during wintertime (>10(4) genome copies per gram, gc/g) and
   minimum values in summer below the LOQ (<130/140 gc/g). HEV has never
   been found as well as biotoxins. Total As concentration was found in
   oysters in the range 0.45-3.0 mg/kg, while inorganic As was found in all
   samples in concentrations below the LOQ (<0.020 mg/kg). The study
   highlights how the 24 h depuration process didn't reduce significantly
   NoV levels and therefore the high concentration of NoV in oysters could
   represent a risk for consumers especially during winter and spring
   months.},

Abstract = {Marine chemical ecology comprises the study of the production and
   interaction of bioactive molecules affecting organism behavior and
   function. Here we focus on bioactive compounds and interactions
   associated with phytoplankton, particularly bloom-forming diatoms,
   prymnesiophytes and dinoflagellates. Planktonic bioactive metabolites
   are structurally and functionally diverse and some may have multiple
   simultaneous functions including roles in chemical defense
   (antipredator, allelopathic and antibacterial compounds), and/or
   cell-to-cell signaling (e. g., polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) of
   diatoms). Among inducible chemical defenses in response to grazing,
   there is high species-specific variability in the effects on grazers,
   ranging from severe physical incapacitation and/or death to no apparent
   physiological response, depending on predator susceptibility and
   detoxification capability. Most bioactive compounds are present in very
   low concentrations, in both the producing organism and the surrounding
   aqueous medium. Furthermore, bioactivity may be subject to synergistic
   interactions with other natural and anthropogenic environmental
   toxicants. Most, if not all phycotoxins are classic secondary
   metabolites, but many other bioactive metabolites are simple molecules
   derived from primary metabolism (e. g., PUAs in diatoms,
   dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in prymnesiophytes). Producing cells
   do not seem to suffer physiological impact due to their synthesis.
   Functional genome sequence data and gene expression analysis will
   provide insights into regulatory and metabolic pathways in producer
   organisms, as well as identification of mechanisms of action in target
   organisms. Understanding chemical ecological responses to environmental
   triggers and chemically-mediated species interactions will help define
   crucial chemical and molecular processes that help maintain biodiversity
   and ecosystem functionality.},

Title = {Activation of a tunicate (Ciona intestinalis) xenobiotic receptor
   orthologue by both natural toxins and synthetic toxicants},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-372},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Vertebrate xenobiotic receptors are ligand-activated nuclear receptors
   (NRs) that bind exogenous biologically active chemicals before
   activating the transcription of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism
   and excretion. Typically, xenobiotic receptors have ligand binding
   domains (LBDs) that can accommodate a structurally diverse array of
   molecules and in addition display high levels of inter-taxa sequence
   diversity suggestive of positive selection. Pursuing the idea that
   xenobiotic receptors may adaptively evolve to bind toxic chemicals
   commonly present in an organism's environment/diet, we examined ligand
   binding by a xenobiotic receptor orthologue of a marine filter-feeding
   organism. The solitary tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Phylum Chordata)
   genome encodes an orthologue of the vertebrate pregnane X receptor (PXR)
   and vitamin D receptor (VDR), here denoted CiVDR/PXR alpha. In a
   luciferase reporter assay the CiVDR/PXR alpha was activated, at
   nanomolar concentrations, by two of four natural marine microalgal
   biotoxins tested (okadaic acid, EC50 = 18.2 +/- 0.9 nM and
   pectenotoxin-2, EC50 = 37.0 +/- 3.5 nM) along with 1 of 11 synthetic
   toxicants (esfenvalerate: EC50 = 0.59 +/- 0.7 mu M). Two related C
   intestinalis NRs, orthologous to vertebrate farnesoid X receptor and
   liver X receptors, respectively, along with the PXR of a freshwater fish
   (zebrafish, Danio rerio), were not activated by any of the 15 chemicals
   tested. In contrast, human PXR was activated by okadaic acid at similar
   concentrations to CiVDR/PXR alpha (EC50 = 7.2 +/- 1.1 nM) but not by
   pectenotoxin-2. A common features pharmacophore developed for the
   CiVDR/PXR alpha ligand consisted of an off-center hydrogen bond acceptor
   flanked by two hydrophobic regions. The results of this study are
   consistent with the original hypothesis that natural toxins, present in
   the diet of filter-feeding marine invertebrates, may have acted as
   selective agents in the molecular evolution of tunicate xenobiotic
   receptors. Bioassays based on tunicate xenobiotic receptor activation
   may find application in marine environmental monitoring and
   bioprospecting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ocean acidification exacerbates the effects of paralytic shellfish
   toxins on the fitness of the edible mussel Mytilus chilensis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {653},
Pages = {455-464},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {High latitudes are considered particularly vulnerable to ocean
   acidification, since they are naturally low in carbonate ions. The
   edible mussel Mytilus chilensis is a common calcifier inhabiting marine
   ecosystems of the southern Chile, where culturing of this species is
   concentrated and where algal blooms produced by the toxic dinoflagellate
   A. catenella are becoming more frequent. Juvenile Mytilus chilensis were
   exposed to experimental conditions simulating two environmental
   phenomena: pCO(2) increase and the presence of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PST) produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella.
   Individuals were exposed to two levels of pCO(2): 380 mu atm (control
   condition) and 1000 mu atm (future conditions) over a period of 39 days
   (acclimation), followed by another period of 40 days exposure to a
   combination of pCO(2) and PST. Both factors significantly affected most
   of the physiological variables measured (feeding, metabolismand scope
   for growth). However, these effects greatly varied over time, which can
   be explained by the high individual variability described formussels
   exposed to different environmental conditions. Absorption efficiency was
   not affected by the independent effect of the toxic diet; however, the
   diet and pCO(2) interaction affected it significantly. The inhibition of
   the physiological processes related with energy acquisition by diets
   containing PST, may negatively impact mussel fitness, which could have
   important consequences for both wild and cultured mussel populations,
   and thus, for socioeconomic development in southern Chile. (c) 2018

Title = {Predictive toxinology: An initial foray using calculated molecular
   descriptors to describe toxicity using saxitoxins as a model},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {50},
Number = {7},
Pages = {901-913},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Molecular descriptors and their mathematical combination have been used
   for predictive toxicology and risk assessments of environmental
   pollutants and pharmaceutical leads. However, this approach has not yet
   been used for natural toxins and may contribute to health and
   environmental risk assessments of newly discovered toxins without having
   to undertake whole animal toxicology. To explore this approach, over
   3000 descriptors were calculated for each of the 30 saxitoxins for which
   mouse toxicities have been reported. This dataset was reduced to only 87
   descriptors by firstly eliminating descriptors that were the same for
   all toxins or could not be calculated for all 30 toxins, and then
   removing those descriptors that did not have a statistically significant
   linear relationship with toxicity values. From the remaining 87
   descriptors, a subset of seven descriptors was identified upon which
   various mathematical approaches were assessed for their ability to fit
   the dataset both with and without leave-one-out cross-validation.
   K-nearest neighbours and support vector machine regression along with
   various combinations of these seven descriptors fit the toxicity data
   almost perfectly and also achieved high predictability as measured by
   leave-one-out cross-validation. Of these seven descriptors, five
   incorporated weighting by estimates of atomic polarizability and
   electronic states. Predicted toxicities of several saxitoxins of unknown
   toxicity bore similarities to the pattern of known potencies of these
   toxins on various isoforms of the voltage-gated sodium channel. Some of
   these predicted toxicity values however would not be expected if there
   was a direct relationship between mammalian sodium channel affinity of
   the saxitoxins and whole animal toxicity. Crown Copyright (c) 2007

Title = {Two novel multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP/ABCC) from the
   Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis):
   characterization and expression patterns in detoxifying tissues},
Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP) belong to the ABCC branch
   of the ABC transporters. The MRP together with P-gp (P-glycoprotein;
   MDR1; ABCB1) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein; ABCG2) confer
   multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) in marine vertebrates. In aquatic
   invertebrates, little is known about the presence and role of these ABC
   transporters. The ABC transporters play an important role in the
   absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs, xenobiotics, and
   endogenous compounds and are predominantly expressed in excretory
   organs. In the present study, we identified and characterized two
   MRP/ABCC transporters (mrp1 and mrp2) from the Mediterranean mussel
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819). The two cDNAs finally
   obtained were 4648 bp for mrp1 and 5065 bp for mrp2 with open reading
   frames of 1500 and 1524 residues, respectively. Analysis of the amino
   acid sequences revealed the structural organization of ABC transporters
   with the typical and highly conserved motifs. The expression levels of
   these genes revealed that the highest expression of mrp1 and mrp2 genes
   was found in the digestive gland followed by gills, and the lowest
   expression of the three tissues was detected in the mantle. The
   expression of these genes was also studied in mussels naturally
   contaminated with okadaic acid (from a bloom of Dinophysis acuminata
   Claparede and Lachmann, 1859). The overexpression of mrp2 in the
   digestive gland suggests that this gene is involved in the process of
   detoxification of okadaic acid in M. galloprovincilais. These expression
   patterns agree with the suggested role of these genes in the protection
   against endogenous or exogenous compounds in aquatic organisms.},

   dioxin is the first step in a cascade pathway producing major changes in
   gene expression, we reasoned that PbTx-6 might produce similar
   genomic-wide changes in expression. Mice were injected i.p. with
   sub-lethal doses of PbTx's (either 1.5 or 3 mg/g body weight of PbTx-6;
   or 0.15 mg/g body weight of PbTx-2, a toxin not avidly bound by the
   AhR), and liver and brain tissues were sampled at 8, 24 and 72 h and RNA
   was isolated. Changes in gene-specific RNA levels were assessed using
   commercially available mouse cDNA arrays (Incyte) containing > 9600
   array elements, including many elements from AhR-mediated genes.
   Histopathology of the two organs was also assessed. We observed minor
   histopathological effects and a total of only 29 significant ( >
   2.0-fold) changes in gene expression, most of which occurred in the
   liver, and most of which could be attributable to an `acute phase'
   inflammatory response. These results argue against the hypothesis that
   PbTx-6 acts via a classic AhR-mediated mechanism to evoke gene
   expression changes. However, given the avidity with which PbTx-6 binds
   to the AhR, these findings have important implications for how PbTx's
   may act in concert with other toxicants that are sensed by the AhR. (C)

Abstract = {The haemolytic properties of phytoplankton toxins have been already
   demonstrated in many red tides. Although the detection of red blood cell
   (RBC) lysis is straightforward, it is not always easy to choose the most
   suitable type of RBC and incubation time. We have investigated these two
   points in order to obtain reproducible and quantifiable results, by
   applying the test to known haemolytic molecules. The dose-response curve
   is sigmoidal. The spiking technique allows a lowering of the detectable
   haemolytic threshold. Saponin and Kanagawa's haemolysin were used.
   Without previous concentration, the detection limit was at 4000 HU
   1(-1). A chloroform-methanol extraction allowed the detection limit to
   be lowered to 0.1 HU 1(-1). This method has been applied to the
   detection of a marine dinoflagellate whose exotoxin is haemolytic. It
   may be used for in situ detection of any haemolytic substance.},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs represent an important food source within the
   Philippines, but the health of seafood consumers is compromised through
   the accumulation of harmful algal toxins in edible shellfish tissues. In
   order to assess the dynamics of toxin risk in shellfish, this study
   investigated the uptake, depuration, assimilation, and analogue changes
   of paralytic shellfish toxins in Perna viridis. Tank experiments were
   conducted where mussels were fed with the toxic dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium minutum. Water and shellfish were sampled over a six day
   period to determine toxin concentrations in the shellfish meat and
   water, as well as algal cell densities. The maximum summed toxin
   concentration determined was 367 mu g STX eq./100 g shellfish tissue,
   more than six times higher than the regulatory action limit in the
   Philippines. Several uptake and depuration cycles were observed during
   the study, with the first observed within the first 24 h coinciding with
   high algal cell densities. Toxin burdens were assessed within different
   parts of the shellfish tissue, with the highest levels quantified in the
   mantle during the first 18 h period but shifting towards the gut
   thereafter. A comparison of toxin profile data evidenced the conversion
   of GTX1,4 in the source algae to the less potent GTX2,3 in the shellfish
   tissue. Overall, the study illustrated the temporal variability in Perna
   viridis toxin concentrations during a modelled algal bloom event, and
   the accumulation of toxin from the water even after toxic algae were
   removed.},

Abstract = {Most marine biotoxins are produced by microalgae. The neurotoxin
   tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been reported in many seafood species worldwide
   but its source is unknown, making accumulation and depuration studies in
   shellfish difficult. Tetrodotoxin is a water-soluble toxin and cannot be
   directly ingested by shellfish. In the present study, a method was
   developed which involved binding TTX to solid particles of humic acid
   and encapsulating them in agar-gelatin capsules. A controlled quantity
   of TTX-containing microcapsules (size range 20-280 mu m) was fed to
   Paphies australis, a bivalve known to accumulate TTX in the wild. The
   TTX-containing microcapsules were fed to P. australis every second day
   for 13 days. Ten P. australis (including five controls fed non-toxic
   microalgae) were harvested after 7 days and ten after 13 days. Paphies
   australis accumulated TTX, reaching concentrations of up to 103 mu g
   kg(-1) by day 13, exceeding the European Food Safety Authority
   recommended concentration of 44 mu g kg(-1) in shellfish. This novel
   method will allow future studies to explore the effects, accumulation
   and depuration rates of TTX in different animals and document how it is
   transferred through food webs.},

Title = {Species-specific mercury speciation in billfishes and its implications
   for food safety monitoring and dietary advice},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {195},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Humans are exposed to toxic methylmercury mainly by consuming marine
   fish, in particular top predator species like billfishes or tunas. In
   seafood risk assessments, mercury is assumed to be mostly present as
   organic methylmercury in predatory fishes; yet high percentages of
   inorganic mercury were recently reported in marlins, suggesting markedly
   different methylmercury metabolism across species. We quantified total
   mercury and methylmercury concentrations in muscle of four billfish
   species from the Indian and the Pacific oceans to address this knowledge
   gap. We found low percentages of methylmercury in blue and black marlins
   (15 +/- 7 \%) compared to swordfish and striped marlin (89 +/- 13 \%),
   with no significant differences among ocean regions. This illustrates
   that billfishes exhibit species-specific methylmercury bioaccumulation
   patterns, likely related to unique selenium-dependent in vivo
   methylmercury demethylation capacities in muscle. Blue and black marlins
   therefore appeared generally safer for human consumption than swordfish
   and striped marlin regarding MeHg toxicological effects. Yet, no matter
   the species, the frequency of recommended weekly billfish meals
   decreased with increasing fish size, given that mercury naturally
   accumulates over time. When assessing potential risks of billfish
   consumption, we therefore recommend measuring methylmercury, rather than
   total mercury, and relying on a large number of samples to cover a broad
   range of fish sizes. This study calls for additional characterization of
   mercury speciation and bioavailability in billfishes to better
   understand the mechanisms driving speciesspecific differences of
   methylmercury detoxification, and to refine dietary advices associated
   to marine top predators consumption.},

Title = {Metabolic transformation of paralytic shellfish toxins in the mussel
   Mytilus galloprovincialis under different exposure modes},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Gymnodinium catenatum is a widely distributed toxic marine
   dinoflagellate that produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). It is
   prone to causing algal blooms and poses a serious threat to the
   shellfish industry and human health. Previous studies have shown that
   when algal blooms occur, shellfish can accumulate PSTs in their bodies
   due to filtration. In this study, mussels ( Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   were fed with G. catenatum at different fixed or varied cell density
   over time, with the latter designed to mimic the changes in algal cell
   density over time in the wild. The PST concentration in the mussels was
   positively correlated with the number of algal cells, and PSTs rapidly
   accumulated in the mussels under both feeding modes. Compared with
   constant feeding in the low feeding group, variable cell density feeding
   over time was more conducive to the accumulation of PSTs in M.
   galloprovincialis. An obvious toxin transformation process was also
   detected in the mussels, which transformed the less toxic gonyautoxins-5
   and-6 and N-sulfocarbamoyl gonyautoxin-3 ingested from G. catenatum into
   the more toxic decarbamoyl gonyautoxin-2, decarbamoyl saxitoxin, and
   decarbamoyl neosaxitoxin. The ratio of epimer pairs, alpha:beta, tended
   to stabilize when the toxin concentration was highest, and it increased
   rapidly after mussels stopped consuming toxigenic algae. These results
   suggested that the formation of alpha-stable toxoids mainly occurred
   during the process of toxin depuration. Toxins were also transformed
   from low to high toxicity, and alpha-stable toxoids were formed mainly
   in the hepatopancreas. These results provided basic data for better
   understanding of the laws governing metabolic transformation of PSTs in
   bivalves during algal blooms.},

Abstract = {Small molecules that bind to voltage-gateds odium channels (VGSCs) are
   promising leads in the treatment of numerous neurodegenerative diseases
   and pain. Nature is a highly skilled medicinal chemist in this regard,
   designing potent VGSC ligands capable of binding to and blocking the
   channel, thereby offering compounds of potential therapeutic interest.
   Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), produced by cyanobacteria and marine
   dinoflagellates, are examples of these naturally occurring small
   molecule VGSC blockers that can potentially be leveraged to solve human
   health concerns. Unfortunately, the remarkable potency of these natural
   products results in equally exceptional toxicity, presenting a
   significant challenge for the therapeutic application of these
   compounds. Identifying less potent analogs and convenient methods for
   accessing them therefore provides an attractive approach to developing
   molecules with enhanced therapeutic potential. Fortunately, Nature has
   evolved tools to modulate the toxicity of PSTs through selective
   hydroxylation, sulfation, and desulfation of the core scaffold. Here, we
   demonstrate the function of enzymes encoded in cyanobacterial PST
   biosynthetic gene clusters that have evolved specifically for the
   sulfation of highly functionalized PSTs, the substrate scope of these
   enzymes, and elucidate the biosynthetic route from saxitoxin to
   monosulfated gonyautoxins and disulfated C-toxins. Finally, the binding
   affinities of the nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated products of
   these enzymatic reactions have been evaluated for VGSC binding affinity
   using mouse whole brain membrane preparations to provide an assessment
   of relative toxicity. These data demonstrate the unique detoxification
   effect of sulfotransferases in PST biosynthesis, providing a potential
   mechanism for the development of more attractive PST-derived therapeutic
   analogs.},

Abstract = {A seafood poisoning event occurred in Qinhuangdao, China, in April 2016.
   Subsequently, the causative mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were
   harvested and analyzed to reveal a high concentration {[}similar to 10
   758 mu g of saxitoxin (STX) equiv kg(-1)] of paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs), including gonyautoxin (GTX)1/4 and GTX2/3, as well as new
   metabolites 11-hydroxy-STX (M2), 11,11-dihydroxy-STX (M4), open-ring
   11,11-dihydroxy-STX (M6), 11-hydroxy-neosaxitoxin (NEO) (M8), and
   11,11dihydroxy-NEO (M10). To understand the origin and biotransformation
   pathways of these new metabolites, uncontaminated mussels (M.
   galloprovincialis) were fed with either of two Alexandrium tamarense
   strains (ATHK and TIO108) under laboratory conditions. Similar PST
   metabolites were also detected in mussels from both feeding experiments.
   Results supposed that 11hydroxy-C2 toxin (Ml) and 11,11-dihydroxy-C2
   (M3) are transformed from C2, while 11-hydroxy-C4 toxin (M7) and
   11,11dihydroxy-C4 (M9) are converted from C4. In addition, the
   metabolites M2, M4, and M6 appear to be products of GTX2/3, and the
   metabolites M8 and M10 are likely derived from GTX1/4.},

Abstract = {HABs pose a threat to coastal ecosystems, the economic sector and human
   health, and are expanding globally. However, their influence on
   copepods, a major connector between primary producers and upper trophic
   levels, remains essentially unknown. Microalgal toxins can eventually
   control copepod survival and reproduction by deterring grazing and hence
   reducing food availability. We present several 24-h experiments in which
   the globally distributed marine copepod, Acartia tonsa, was exposed to
   different concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium
   minutum, grown under three N:P ratios (4:1, 16:1 and 80:1), with the
   simultaneous presence of non-toxic food (the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum
   micans). The different N:P ratios did not affect the toxicity of A.
   minutum, probably due to the low toxicity of the tested strain.
   Production of eggs and pellets as well as ingested carbon appeared to be
   affected by food toxicity. Toxicity levels in A. minutum also had an
   effect on hatching success and on the toxin excreted in pellets.
   Overall, A. minutum toxicity affected the reproduction, toxin excretion
   and, to an extent, the feeding behavior of A. tonsa. This work indicates
   that even short-term exposure to toxic A. minutum can impact the vital
   functions of A. tonsa and might ultimately pose serious threats to
   copepod recruitment and survival. Still, further investigation is
   required for identifying and understanding, in particular, the long-term
   effects of harmful microalgae on marine copepods.},

Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Warmer seawater temperatures are expected to increase harmful algal
   blooms (HABs) occurrence, intensity, and distribution. Yet, the
   potential interactions between abiotic stressors and HABs are still
   poorly understood from ecological and seafood safety perspectives. The
   present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the
   bioaccumulation/depuration mechanisms and ecotoxicological responses of
   juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) exposed to paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST) under different temperatures (18, 21, 24 degrees
   C). PST were detected in fish at the peak of the exposure period (day
   five, 0.22 mu g g(-1) N-sulfocarbamoylGonyautoxin-1-2 (C1 and C2), 0.08
   mu g g(-1) Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and 0.18 mu g g(-1)
   Gonyautoxin-5 (B1)), being rapidly eliminated (within the first 24 h of
   depuration), regardless of exposure temperature. Increased temperatures
   led to significantly higher PST contamination (275 mu g STX eq. kg(-1)).
   During the trial, fish antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide
   dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione S-transferase, GST) in both
   muscle and viscera were affected by temperature, whereas a significant
   induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70), Ubiquitin (Ub) activity
   (viscera), and lipid peroxidation (LPO; muscle) was observed under the
   combination of warming and PST exposure. The differential
   bioaccumulation and biomarker responses observed highlight the need to
   further understand the interactive effects between PST and abiotic
   stressors, to better estimate climate change impacts on HABs events, and
   to develop mitigation strategies to overcome the potential risks
   associated with seafood consumption.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) producing microalgal blooms have a
   significant economic impact on the Southern Rock Lobster (Jasus
   edwardsii) fishery in Tasmania, Australia. The regulatory level of 0.8
   mg of saxitoxin (STX) eq/kg in place for bivalve shellfish fisheries is
   applied to lobster hepatopancreas during blooms of toxic algae,
   resulting in harvest closures and ongoing risk management implications
   for the fishery. This cooking study was undertaken to inform a human
   health risk assessment, in conjunction with studies on the uptake and
   elimination of PST in J. edwardsii. Live lobsters in tanks were
   contaminated through consumption of PST-containing mussels harvested
   during an Alexandrium tamarense Group 1 bloom event. This resulted in a
   mean lobster hepatopancreas level of 2.83 +/- 6 0.84 mg of STX center
   dot 2HCl eq/kg. Other edible tissues contained negligible concentrations
   of toxin. PST concentrations in all tissues did not significantly change
   after boiling or steaming, although the amount of hepatopancreas
   available for consumption did decrease significantly with both cooking
   methods, because the tissue became more dispersed, resulting in an
   overall reduction in the toxin exposure per hepatopancreas consumed. The
   toxin profile was dominated by STX; gonyautoxin 2, 3;
   N-sulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxin 2, 3 (C1,2); and gonyautoxin 5. No
   significant changes to the toxin profile were observed after either of
   the cooking methods. Pate, bisque, and souffle prepared from the
   hepatopancreas of toxic lobsters contained negligible levels of PST in
   each serving; on average, a serving of pate contained 0.01 mg of STX
   center dot 2HCl eq, whereas a serving of bisque or souffl ` e
   contained,0.01 mg of STX center dot 2HCl eq. The findings of this study
   will inform a risk assessment of PST in J. edwardsii to determine risk
   management options for this fishery in Australia.},

   may play a role in the ecology of the producing species. The
   concentration of 1 such external metabolite,
   1-(2,6,6-trimethyl-4-hydroxycyclohexenyl)-1,3-butanedione, produced by
   the marine dinoflagellate P. minimum, was determined quantitatively
   during exponential growth and during senescence in phosphate-starved
   batch cultures. The pattern of production is similar to the production
   of many bacterial toxins. There was little production of the
   .beta.-diketone during the exponential growth period, and highest
   production occurred within 1 wk after cessation of cell division. About
   50\% of the total .beta.-diketone produced was excreted on a single day,
   6 days after phosphate became limiting to growth. Cell lysis or
   photodestruction of carotenoids do not appear to be the source of this
   compound.},

Abstract = {Natural selection is one of the most fundamental processes in biology.
   However, there is still a controversy over the importance of selection
   in microevolution of molecular traits. Despite the general lack of data
   most authors hold the view that selection on molecular characters may be
   important, but at lower rates than selection on most phenotypic traits.
   Here we present evidence that natural selection may contribute
   substantially to molecular variation on a scale of meters only. In
   populations of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis living on exposed
   rocky shores, steep microclines in allele frequencies between splash and
   surf zone groups are present in the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase
   (allozyme locus Aat; EC. 2.6.1.1). We followed one population over 7
   years, including a period of strong natural perturbation. The surf zone
   part of the population dominated by the allele Aat(100) was suddenly
   eliminated by a bloom of a toxin-producing microflagellate. Downshore
   migration of splash zone snails with predominantly Aat(120) alleles
   resulted in a drastic increase in surf zone frequency of Aat(120), from
   0.4 to 0.8 over 2 years. Over the nest four to sis generations, however,
   the frequency of Aat(120) returned to the original value. We estimated
   the coefficient of selection of Aat(120) in the surf zone to be about
   0.4. Earlier studies show similar or even sharper Aat dines in other
   countries, Thus, we conclude that microclinal selection is an important
   evolutionary force in this system.},

Title = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning due to ingestion of contaminated mussels:
   A 2018 case report in Caparica (Portugal)},
Journal = {TOXICON-X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Portugal, the potent paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) have appeared
   irregularly since the onset of a national monitoring program for marine
   biotoxins in 1986. In years where high contamination levels were
   attained in bivalves, sporadic cases of human poisonings have been
   recorded, as in 1994 and 2007. The reappearance of high contamination
   levels led to the appearance of new cases during the autumn of 2018.
   This study details toxin ingestion, symptomatology and toxin elimination
   and metabolization in the fluids of two patients, who ingested mussels
   from the Portuguese southwest coast and required hospitalization due to
   the severity of symptoms. Toxin elimination was confirmed by ELISA in
   plasma and urine samples. In mussel samples, the toxin profile obtained
   by HPLC-FLD displayed a wide diversity of toxins, typical of Gymnodinum
   catenatum ingestion. However, in the urine samples, the toxin profile
   was reduced to B1 and dcSTX. Abundant compounds in mussels having an
   Osulphate at C11, such as C1+2 and dcGTX2+3, were absent in urine. In
   plasma, PSTs were not detected by HPLC-FLD. Calculated toxin ingestion,
   resulting from consumption of an estimated 200-g portion, was in the
   range of 104-120 mu g STX eq./kg b. w.},

Title = {Response of fatty acids and lipid metabolism enzymes during
   accumulation, depuration and esterification of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {206},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Bivalve mollusks accumulate diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) from
   toxigenic microalgae, thus posing a threat to human health by acting as
   a vector of toxins to consumers. In bivalves, free forms of DSTs can be
   esterified with fatty acids at the C-7 site to form acyl esters (DTX3),
   presumably a detoxification mechanism for bivalves. However, the effects
   of esterification of DSTs on fatty acid metabolism in mollusks remain
   poorly understood. In this study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   were fed the DST-producing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima for 10 days
   followed by an additional 10-days depuration in filtered seawater to
   track the variation in quantity and composition of DST acyl esters and
   fatty acids. A variety of esters of okadaic acid (OA) and
   dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) were mainly formed in the digestive gland (DG),
   although trace amounts of esters also appeared in muscle tissue. A large
   relative amount of OA (60\%-84\%) and DTX1 (80\%-92\%) was esterified to
   DTX3 in the visceral mass (referred to as digestive gland, DG), and the
   major ester acyl chains were C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C20:1 and
   C20:2. The DG and muscle tissues showed pronounced differences in fatty
   acid content and composition during both feeding and depuration periods.
   In the DG, fatty acid content gradually decreased in parallel with
   increasing accumulation and esterification of DSTs. The decline in fatty
   acids was accelerated during depuration without food. This reduction in
   the content of important polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), would lead
   to a reduction in the nutritional value of mussels. Enzymes involved in
   lipid metabolism, including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty
   acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL),
   were actively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids in the DG,
   whereas their activities were weak in muscle tissue during the feeding
   period. This study helps to improve the understanding of interactions
   between the esterification of DSTs and fatty acid dynamics in bivalve
   mollusks.},

Title = {Physiological and Metabolic Responses of Marine Mussels Exposed to Toxic
   Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum

Journal = {TOXINS},

Abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a major contaminant in inland aquatic
   ecosystems. Furthermore, toxic blooms are carried downstream by rivers
   and waterways to estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Concerning marine and
   estuarine animal species, very little is known about how these species
   are affected by the exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria and
   cyanotoxins. So far, most of the knowledge has been gathered from
   freshwater bivalve molluscs. This work aimed to infer the sensitivity of
   the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to single as well as mixed
   toxic cyanobacterial cultures and the underlying molecular responses
   mediated by toxic cyanobacteria. For this purpose, a mussel exposure
   experiment was outlined with two toxic cyanobacteria species,
   Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum ovalisporum at 1 x 10(5)
   cells/mL, resembling a natural cyanobacteria bloom. The estimated amount
   of toxins produced by M. aeruginosa and C. ovalisporum were respectively
   0.023 pg/cell of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and 7.854 pg/cell of
   cylindrospermopsin (CYN). After 15 days of exposure to single and mixed
   cyanobacteria, a depuration phase followed, during which mussels were
   fed only non-toxic microalga Parachlorella kessleri. The results showed
   that the marine mussel is able to filter toxic cyanobacteria at a rate
   equal or higher than the non-toxic microalga P. kessleri. Filtration
   rates observed after 15 days of feeding toxic microalgae were 1773.04
   mL/ind.h (for M. aeruginosa), 2151.83 mL/ind.h (for C. ovalisporum),
   1673.29 mL/ind.h (for the mixture of the 2 cyanobacteria) and 2539.25
   mL/ind.h (for the non-toxic P. kessleri). Filtering toxic microalgae in
   combination resulted in the accumulation of 14.17 ng/g dw MC-LR and
   92.08 ng/g dw CYN. Other physiological and biochemical endpoints (dry
   weight, byssus production, total protein and glycogen) measured in this
   work did not change significantly in the groups exposed to toxic
   cyanobacteria with regard to control group, suggesting that mussels were
   not affected with the toxic microalgae. Nevertheless, proteomics
   revealed changes in metabolism of mussels related to diet, specially
   evident in those fed on combined cyanobacteria. Changes in metabolic
   pathways related with protein folding and stabilization, cytoskeleton
   structure, and gene transcription/translation were observed after
   exposure and feeding toxic cyanobacteria. These changes occur in vital
   metabolic processes and may contribute to protect mussels from toxic
   effects of the toxins MC-LR and CYN.},

   Island, Alaska, during 1994, medical records of ill persons were
   reviewed and interviews were conducted, Urine and serum specimens were
   analyzed at three independent laboratories using four different
   saxitoxin binding assays, High-performance liquid chromatography was
   used to determine the presence of specific toxin congeners, Among 11 ill
   persons, three required mechanical ventilation and one died, Mean peak
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were 172 (range
   128-247) and 102 (range 78-165) mmHg, respectively, and blood pressure
   measurements corresponded with ingested toxin dose, All four different
   laboratory methodologies detected toxin in serum at 2.8-47 nM during
   acute illness and toxin in urine at 65-372 nM after acute symptom
   resolution. The composition of specific paralytic shellfish poisons
   differed between mussels and human biological specimens, suggesting that
   human metabolism of toxins had occurred. The results of this study
   indicate that saxitoxin analogues may cause severe hypertension. In
   addition, we demonstrate that saxitoxins can be detected in human
   biological specimens, that nanomolar serum toxin levels may cause
   serious illness and that human metabolism of toxin may occur. Clearance
   of paralytic shellfish poisons from serum was evident within 24 hr and
   urine was identified as a major route of toxin excretion in humans. (C)

Title = {Transcriptional and physiological responses to inorganic nutrition in a
   tropical Pacific strain of Alexandrium minutum: Implications for
   nutrient uptakes and assimilation},
Journal = {GENE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {711},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {The marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum is known to produce
   saxitoxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in human worldwide
   through consumption of the contaminated shellfish mollusks. Despite
   numerous studies on the growth physiology and saxitoxin production of
   this species, the knowledge on the molecular basis of nutrient uptakes
   in relation to toxin production in this species is limited. In this
   study, relative expressions of the high-affinity transporter genes of
   nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate (AmNrt2, AmAmt1 and AmPiPT1) and the
   assimilation genes, nitrate reductase (AmNas), glutamine synthase
   (AmGSIII) and carbamoyl phosphate synthase (AmCPSII) from A. minutum
   were studied in batch clonal culture condition with two nitrogen sources
   (nitrate: NO3- or ammonium: NH4+) under different N:P ratios (high-P:
   N:P of 14 and 16, and low-P: N:P of 155). The expression of AmAmt1 was
   suppressed in excess NH4+-grown condition but was not observed in AmNrt2
   and AmNas. Expressions of AmAmt1, AmNrt2, AmNas, AmGSIII, AmCPSII, and
   AmPiPT1 were high in P-deficient condition, showing that A. minutum is
   likely to take up nutrients for growth under P-stress condition.
   Conversely, relative expression of AmCPSII was incongruent with cell
   growth, but was well correlated with toxin quota, suggesting that the
   gene might involve in arginine metabolism and related toxin production
   pathway. The expression of AmGSIII is found coincided with higher toxin
   production and is believed to involve in mechanism to detoxify the cells
   from excess ammonium stress. The gene regulation observed in this study
   has provided better insights into the ecophysiology of A. minutum in
   relation to its adaptive strategies in unfavorable environments.},

Abstract = {Contamination of economic bivalves with paralytic shellfish toxins (PST)
   occurs frequently in many parts of the world, which potentially
   threatens consumer health and the marine aquaculture economy. It is the
   objective of this study to develop a suitable technology for
   accelerating detoxification of PST from shellfish using activated carbon
   (AC). The adsorption efficiency of PST by eight different AC materials
   and by different particle sizes of wood-based AC (WAC) were tested and
   compared. Then WAC particles (37-48 mu m) were fed to mussels Mytilus
   galloprovincialis and scallops Chlamys farreri previously contaminated
   with PST through feeding with dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense ATHK.
   Results showed that the maximum adsorption ratio (65\%) of PST was
   obtained by WAC. No significant differences in adsorption ratios were
   found between different particle sizes of WAC. The toxicity of mussels
   decreased by 41\% and 68\% after detoxification with WAC for 1 d and 3
   d, respectively. Meanwhile, the detoxification ratio of mussels was
   approximately 3 times higher than that of scallops. This study suggests
   that the WAC could be used to accelerate the detoxification of PST by
   shellfish.},

Abstract = {Quantitative determination by high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) was performed for gymnodimine-A (GYM-A), a phycotoxin responsible
   for the contamination of Tunisian clams. This study demonstrates a rapid
   and reproducible HPLC-ultraviolet (UV) method for extraction, detection
   and quantification of GYM-A in toxic clams. The extraction of GYM-A from
   the digestive gland of clams in acetone, subsequent clean-up with
   diethyl ether and extraction with dichloromethane is the more valid
   protocol. Chromatography analyses were performed using a gradient of
   acetonitrile-water (10:90 to 90:10), containing trifluoroacetic acid
   (0.1\%) for 20 min at 1 mL/min rate with a C18 column. Recovery rates
   exceeded 96\%, and limits of detection and quantification were 5 ng/mL
   and 8 ng/g digestive gland, respectively. Repeatability and
   reproducibility were tested for various samples containing different
   levels of GYM-A. A significant correlation was observed between toxicity
   level of samples and the determined amount of GYM-A. Also, the
   persistence of GYM-A in contaminated clams from Boughrara lagoon was
   demonstrated. The kinetics discharge study of GYM-A in controlled
   medium, during 1 month, showed that the process of depuration was
   biphasic with an exponential discharge of 75\% of the total amount of
   sequestered GYM-A during the first 12 days followed by a slow discharge
   (> 10\%) for the subsequent days up to the seventeenth day. This is the
   first time that a quantitative study of GYM-A in clams from Tunisian
   coasts is performed through the development of a new method for
   detection and quantify of this phycotoxin. We found HPLC-UV a reliable
   and suitable alternative to the mouse bioassay.},

Title = {The Competitive Edge: T6SS-Mediated Interference Competition by
   Vibrionaceae Across Marine Ecological Niches},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Interference competition, wherein bacteria actively antagonize and
   damage their microbial neighbors, is a key ecological strategy governing
   microbial community structure and composition. To gain a competitive
   edge, bacteria can deploy a diverse array of antimicrobial
   weapons-ranging from diffusible toxins to contact-mediated systems in
   order to eliminate their bacterial rivals. Among Gram-negative bacteria,
   the type VI secretion system (T6SS) has emerged as a potent and
   sophisticated contact-dependent mechanism that enables the delivery of
   toxic cargo into neighboring cells, thereby promoting the colonization
   and dominance of a bacterial taxon within an ecological niche. In this
   review, we examine the ecological significance of T6SS-mediated
   interference competition by members of the Vibrionaceae family across a
   range of marine habitats that include free-living microbial communities
   and host-associated niches such as coral and squid symbioses.
   Additionally, we explore the ecological impact of T6SS-mediated
   competition in modulating biofilm community structure and promoting
   horizontal gene transfer within those complex microbial populations.
   Together, these insights underscore the ecological versatility of the
   T6SS and emphasize its role in driving antagonistic bacterial
   interactions and shaping microbial community dynamics within marine
   ecosystems.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {There is growing evidence that climate change will increase the
   prevalence of toxic algae and harmful bacteria, which can accumulate in
   marine bivalves. However, we know little about any possible interactions
   between exposure to these microorganisms and the effects of climate
   change on bivalve health, or about how this may affect the bivalve
   toxin-pathogen load. In mesocosm experiments, mussels, Perna viridis,
   were subjected to simulated climate change (warming and/or hyposalinity)
   and exposed to harmful bacteria and/or toxin-producing dinoflagellates.
   We found significant interactions between climate change and these
   microbes on metabolic and/or immunobiological function and
   toxin-pathogen load in mussels. Surprisingly, however, these effects
   were virtually eliminated when mussels were exposed to both harmful
   microorganisms simultaneously. This study is the first to examine the
   effects of climate change on determining mussel toxin-pathogen load in
   an ecologically relevant, multitrophic context. The results may have
   considerable implications for seafood safety.},

Title = {Nanozyme and bifunctional nanobody-based colorimetric-SERS dual-mode
   Immunosensor for microcystin-LR detection},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a potent cyanotoxin in freshwater, poses a risk
   of severe liver damage and other health issues, making its detection
   vital. However, the detection capabilities of conventional antibodies
   are constrained, which limited their use in immunoassays. In this work,
   we designed a new bifunctional nanobody, named A2.3SBP (comprised of
   nanobody and streptavidin binding peptide), capable of binding with
   MC-LR and streptavidin. Based on A2.3-SBP and Fe3O4@Au-Pt nanozyme, we
   introduced an enzyme-free immunosensor that operated in microplate with
   colorimetric and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection
   modes. The dual-mode assay showed color changes and SERS intensity
   directly correlating to MC-LR concentrations with a range from 1.0 to
   500 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 0.26 and 0.032 ng/mL,
   respectively. This strategy eliminated the need for complex enzymatic
   reactions and realized dual-signal detection of MC-LR in 96 water
   samples (0.03 mu g/kg) within 30 min, suggesting its potential in
   drinking water detection.},

Abstract = {Galicia is an area with a strong mussel aquaculture industry in addition
   to other important bivalve mollusc fisheries. Between 2014 and 2017,
   18,862 samples were analyzed for EU regulated marine lipophilic toxins.
   Okadaic acid (OA) was the most prevalent toxin and the only single toxin
   that produced harvesting closures. Toxin concentrations in raft mussels
   were generally higher than those recorded in other bivalves, justifying
   the use of this species as an indicator. The Rias of Pontevedra and
   Muros were the ones most affected by OA and DTX2 and the Ria of Ares by
   YTXs. In general, the outer areas of the Rias were more affected by OA
   and DTX2 than the inner ones. The OA level reached a maximum in spring,
   while DTX2 was almost entirely restricted to the fall-winter season.
   YTXs peaked in August-September. The toxins of the OA group were nearly
   completely esterified in all the bivalves studied except mussels and
   queen scallops. Risk of intoxication with the current monitoring system
   is low. In less than 2\% of cases did the first detection of OA in an
   area exceed the regulatory limit. In no case, could any effect on humans
   be expected. The apparent intoxication and depuration rates were similar
   and directly related, suggesting that the rates are regulated mainly by
   oceanographic characteristics.},

Title = {Polyphasic Approach and Potential Cyanotoxin Production by

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The development of anthropic activities during recent years has led to
   an increase in nutrient fluxes in the R \& iacute;o Grande de Comit \&
   aacute;n and Montebello Lakes National Park, Mexico. In turn, this has
   modified the dynamics of the biotic community, specifically favoring the
   presence of cyanobacteria tolerant to contamination. The continual and
   massive presence of Planktothrix species (spp.) in the system suggests a
   potential detrimental impact for economic issues and human health. In
   this study, we identify the morphological and molecular characteristics
   of Planktothrix populations from seven tropical (1,380-1,740 masl,
   23.0-25.5 degrees C) and calcareous lakes and two ponds from a water
   treatment plant. We also assess the ecological drivers that could be
   related to the presence of cyanotoxins in the system. The ecological
   preferences, morphology, 16S rRNA structure, and 16S-23S rRNA internal
   transcribed spacer found evidence for three species: P. agardhii
   distributed in neutral to slightly basic water (pH = 7.7-8.7), and P.
   spiroides and Planktothrix sp. in alkaline waters (pH = 9.1). The
   presence of the mcyE gene and its validation by liquid chromatography
   confirmed the presence of two microcystin variants (MC-RR and MC-LR) in
   at least three populations of P. agardhii. These microcystins put the
   health of the ecosystem and its inhabitants at risk, a condition that
   should be addressed and resolved with a water management and
   detoxification strategy in the basin.},

Abstract = {Mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and oysters Crassostrea gigas were
   suspended from a mooring off Lambert's Bay, South Africa, to study the
   kinetics of lipophilic phycotoxin accumulation and detoxification. The
   shellfish were subsequently harvested daily over approximately three
   weeks and analysed for lipophilic phycotoxins by liquid chromatography
   coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction
   monitoring mode. A mass transition typical for the cyclic imine toxin
   gymnodimine was detected in low but consistent levels in all oyster
   samples throughout the sampling period, whereas this peak was detected
   with lesser intensity in only some mussel samples and was frequently
   below the limit of quantitation (0.02 mu g g(-1) fresh weight).
   Comparison of retention times and collision-induced mass spectra of a
   certified standard of gymnodimine and an oyster extract provided
   unambiguous confirmation of the identity of gymnodimine in the shellfish
   extracts. The absence of known producers of gymnodimine in the plankton,
   and the non-detection of gymnodimine in filtered water samples collected
   during the period of study, lead to the conclusion that the shellfish
   were contaminated at their site of initial collection in Saldanha Bay
   prior to deployment off Lambert's Bay. This finding is the first
   confirmed evidence of gymnodimine in the southern Benguela upwelling
   system.},

Title = {Potential multidrug resistance gene POHL:: An ecologically

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {198-204},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sponges are sessile filter feeders found in all aquatic habitats from
   the tropics to the arctic. Against potential environmental hazards, they
   are provided with efficient defense systems, e.g., protecting chaperones
   and/or the P-170/multidrug resistance pump system. Here we report on a
   further multidrug resistance pathway that is related to the pad one
   homologue (POH1) mechanism recently identified in humans. It is
   suggested that proteolysis is involved in the inactivation of
   xenobiotics by the POH1 system. Two cDNAs were cloned, one from the
   demosponge Geodia cydonium and a second from the hexactinellid sponge
   Aphrocallistes vastus. The cDNA from G. cydonium, termed GCPOHL, encodes
   a deduced polypeptide with a size of 34,591 Da and that from A. vastus,
   AVPOHL, a protein of a calculated M-r of 34,282. The two sponge cDNAs
   are highly similar to each other as well as to the known sequences from
   fungi (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and other
   Metazoa (from Schistosoma mansoni to humans). Under controlled
   laboratory conditions, the expression of the potential multidrug
   resistance gene POHL is, in G. cydonium, strongly upregulated in
   response to the toxins staurosporin (20 muM) or taxol (50 muM); the
   first detectable transcripts appear after 1 d and reach a maximum after
   3 to 5 d of incubation. The relevance of the expression pattern of the
   G. cydonium gene POHL for the assessment of pollution in the field was
   determined at differently polluted sites in the area around Rovinj
   (Croatia; Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea). The load of the selected
   sites was assessed by measuring the potency of XAD-7 concentrates of
   water samples taken from those places to induce the level of
   benzo{[}a]pyrene monooxygenase (BaPMO) in fish and to impair the
   multidrug resistance (MDR)/P-170 extrusion pump in clams. These field
   experiments revealed that the levels of inducible BaPMO activity in fish
   and of the MDR potential by the water concentrates are highly correlated
   with the level of expression of the potential multidrug resistance gene
   POHL in G. cydonium. This report demonstrates that the detoxification
   POH pathway, here mediated by the G. cydonium GCPOHL gene, is an
   additional marker for the assessment of the environmental load in a
   given marine area.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Due to the possibility that bacteria could be involved in the clearance
   of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) from bivalve molluscs,
   investigations into which, if any, bacteria were able to grow at the
   expense of PST focused on several common shellfish species. These
   species were blue mussels, oysters, razor fish, cockles, and queen and
   king scallops, Bacteria associated with these shellfish were isolated on
   marine agar 2216 and characterized by their carbon utilization profiles
   (BIOLOG), Selected isolates from groups demonstrating 90\% similarity
   were screened for their ability to metabolize a range of PST
   (gonyautoxins 1 and 4 {[}GTX 1/4], GTX 2/3, GTX 5, saxitoxin, and
   neosaxitoxin) using a novel screening method and confirming its results
   by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results suggest that
   molluscan bacteria have different capacities to utilize and transform
   PST analogues, For example, isolates M12 and R65 were able to
   reductively transform GTX 1/4 with concomitant production of GTX 2/3,
   while isolate Q5 apparently degraded GTX 1/4 without the appearance of
   other GTXs, Other observed possible mechanisms of PST transformations
   include decarbamoylation by isolate M12 and sulfation of GTXs by
   isolates Q5, R65, M12, and C3, These findings raise questions as to the
   possible role of bacteria resident in the shellfish food transport
   system. Some researchers have suggested that the microflora play a role
   in supplying nutritional requirements of the host, This study
   demonstrates that bacteria may also be involved in PST transformation
   and elimination in molluscan species.},

Abstract = {In April 1999, monitoring on two West Coast abalone farms provided
   evidence of the presence of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxins
   in the cultured abalone Haliotis midae. Subsequent analysis of wild
   animals collected from the West Coast also revealed the accumulation of
   PSP toxins in these gastropods. The toxicity of individual animals as
   measured by the AOAC mouse bioassay showed considerable variation,
   ranging from below the assay detection limit to a maximum of 1609 mug
   STXeq 100g(-1). Initial observations found PSP toxins in abalone to be
   coincident with blooms of Alexandrium catenella indicating that this
   dinoflagellate was the probable cause of abalone toxicity. Subsequent
   detection by receptor binding assay, of toxicity in abalone on the South
   Coast, an area considered free of A. catenella blooms, casts some doubt
   as to the source of the toxins. The toxin composition in the abalone as
   determined by HPLC was dominated by STX, and differed significantly from
   the toxin profile of A. catenella and the co-occurring mussel, Mytilus
   galloprovincialis. Either these findings indicated a high capacity for
   biotransformation of PSP toxins by abalone or that A. catenella was not
   the source of the toxin. Investigation of the anatomical distribution of
   toxins revealed that they were not evenly distributed throughout the
   abalone tissues, but appeared to concentrate in outer layer tissue. The
   muscular foot made a disproportionately low contribution to the total
   toxin content of the mollusc, whereas the epipodial fringe, although
   comprising a small proportion of the abalone total weight, contributed
   substantially to the total toxin content. The epipodial fringe is
   typically included with the muscular foot as that part of the animal
   marketed for human consumption. The negative impacts of PSP
   contamination on abalone spawning and larval survival are presented and
   the Findings of this study are compared to observations of PSP toxins in
   the abalone Haliotis tuberculata on the Galician coast. The inability of
   abalone to detoxify or depurate accumulated PSP toxins below the
   regulatory level threatens the future of the established abalone fishery
   and the newly developed aquaculture operations on the West Coast of
   South Africa.},

Abstract = {The effects of harmful algae on bivalve physiology are complex and
   involve both physiological and behavioural responses. Studying those
   responses is essential to better describe and predict their impact on
   shellfish aqua culture and health risk for humans. In this study we
   recorded for two months the physiological response of the blue mussel
   Mytilus edulis from Eastern Canada to a one-week exposure to a paralytic
   shellfish poisoning producing dinoflagellate strain of Alexandrium
   catenella, isolated from the St Lawrence estuary, Canada. Mussels in a
   `control' treatment were fed continuously with a non-toxic diet, while
   mussels in a `starvation' treatment were fed the same non-toxic diet the
   first week and subsequently starved for seven weeks. Mussels in a
   `toxic' treatment received A. catenella for one week before being
   starved until the end of the experiment. Over a two month experiment we
   monitored shell and tissue growth, filtration capacity, respiration
   rate, byssal attachment strength, valve opening behaviour, and toxin
   content in tissues. Mussels fed normally on the toxic dinoflagellate and
   accumulated an average of 51.6 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1) after one week of
   exposure. After seven weeks of depuration, about half of the specimen
   showed levels around 18 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1). The condition index of
   exposed mussels ('toxic' treatment) decreased rapidly from the start as
   compared to mussels that received a one-week non-toxic diet
   ('starvation' treatment). Oxygen consumption rates increased in the
   `toxic' treatment before leveling out with that of mussels from the
   `starvation' treatment. Valve opening amplitude was lower in the `toxic'
   treatment during and following the exposure. Average valve closure
   duration was higher right after the exposure, during the peak of mussel
   tissue intoxication. No significant change in byssal thread strength was
   observed through time in each treatment but less force was required to
   detach mussels from the `toxic' and `starvation' treatments. The number
   of byssus threads produced by mussels exposed to the toxic
   dinoflagellate was also lower than in the control group. These results
   represent advancements in our understanding of the impacts of harmful
   algae on bivalves and contribute to the development of mitigation
   measures necessary to both the safety of consumers and the
   sustainability of aquaculture operations.},

Title = {Critical Review and Conceptual and Quantitative Models for the Transfer
   and Depuration of Ciguatoxins in Fishes},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We review and develop conceptual models for the bio-transfer of
   ciguatoxins in food chains for Platypus Bay and the Great Barrier Reef
   on the east coast of Australia. Platypus Bay is unique in repeatedly
   producing ciguateric fishes in Australia, with ciguatoxins produced by
   benthic dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus spp.) growing epiphytically on
   free-living, benthic macroalgae. The Gambierdiscus are consumed by
   invertebrates living within the macroalgae, which are preyed upon by
   small carnivorous fishes, which are then preyed upon by Spanish mackerel
   (Scomberomorus commerson). We hypothesise that Gambierdiscus and/or
   Fukuyoa species growing on turf algae are the main source of ciguatoxins
   entering marine food chains to cause ciguatera on the Great Barrier
   Reef. The abundance of surgeonfish that feed on turf algae may act as a
   feedback mechanism controlling the flow of ciguatoxins through this
   marine food chain. If this hypothesis is broadly applicable, then a
   reduction in herbivory from overharvesting of herbivores could lead to
   increases in ciguatera by concentrating ciguatoxins through the
   remaining, smaller population of herbivores. Modelling the dilution of
   ciguatoxins by somatic growth in Spanish mackerel and coral trout
   (Plectropomus leopardus) revealed that growth could not significantly
   reduce the toxicity of fish flesh, except in young fast-growing fishes
   or legal-sized fishes contaminated with low levels of ciguatoxins. If
   Spanish mackerel along the east coast of Australia can depurate
   ciguatoxins, it is most likely with a half-life of <= 1-year. Our review
   and conceptual models can aid management and research of ciguatera in
   Australia, and globally.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {479},
Pages = {120-124},

Abstract = {Accumulation of marine toxins in the organisms is one of the most
   important problems of the bivalve aquaculture. Mitigation methods are
   difficult to implement especially in species, as the mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, which have a relatively low commercial value. For
   this species, one possible way of decreasing the toxin accumulation is
   to restrict the availability of toxic cells to the mussels by means of
   the reduction of the water flow around the perimeter of the culture
   ropes. We have checked the effectivity to decrease the accumulation of
   DSP toxins (okadaic acid) in mussels of two ways of obtaining that
   reduction: surrounding the ropes with a fishing net (1 cm mesh); and
   grouping the ropes (groups of four). During a four week period - with
   relatively high concentrations of particulate matter - those two ways
   were tested and shown to effectively reduce both, toxin concentration
   and toxin burden of cultured mussels exposed to toxic populations of
   Dinophysis acuminata. The observed reductions were important, 41\% and
   37\% for grouping and surrounding with a net, respectively. Both methods
   can be used for mussel rafts and long lines and it is very likely they
   could be also effective with other kinds of toxicity and with other
   environmental conditions.
   Statement of relevance: It would allow a substantial reduction of toxin
   accumulation.},

Abstract = {In October 2009, during a Karenia brevis red tide along the Texas coast,
   millions of dead fish washed ashore along the 113-km length of Padre
   Island National Seashore (PATS). Between November 2009 and January 2010,
   at least 12 coyotes (Canis latrans) and three domestic dogs (Canis
   familiaris) died or were euthanized at PATS or local veterinary clinics
   because of illness suspected to be related to the red tide. Another red
   tide event occurred during autumn 2011 and, although fewer dead fish
   were observed relative to the 2009 event, coyotes again were affected.
   Staff at PATS submitted carcasses of four coyotes and one domestic dog
   from November 2009 to February 2010 and six coyotes from October to
   November 2011 for necropsy and ancillary testing. High levels of
   brevetoxins (PbTxs) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   in seven of the coyotes and the dog, with concentrations up to 634 ng
   PbTx-3 eq/g in stomach contents, 545 ng PbTx-3 eq/g in liver, 195 ng
   PbTx-3 eq/g in kidney, and 106 ng PbTx-3 eq/mL in urine samples. Based
   on red tide presence, clinical signs, and postmortem findings,
   brevetoxicosis caused by presumptive ingestion of toxic dead fish was
   the likely cause of canid deaths at PATS. These findings represent the
   first confirmed report of terrestrial mammalian wildlife mortalities
   related to a K brevis bloom. The implications for red tide impacts on
   terrestrial wildlife populations are a potentially significant but
   relatively undocumented phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Diatoms are eukaryotic unicellular plants that constitute one of the
   major components of marine phytoplankton, comprising up to 40\% of
   annual productivity at sea and representing 25\% of global
   carbon-fixation. Diatoms have traditionally been considered a
   preferential food for zooplankton grazers such as copepods, but, in the
   last two decades, this beneficial role has been challenged after the
   discovery that many species of diatoms produce toxic metabolites,
   collectively termed oxylipins, that induce reproductive failure in
   zooplankton grazers. Diatoms are the dominant natural diet of Calanus
   sinicus, a cold-temperate calanoid copepod that supports secondary
   production of important fisheries in the shelf ecosystems of the
   Northwest Pacific Ocean, Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan and South China Sea.
   In this study, the effect of the oxylipin-producing diatom Skeletonema
   marinoi on C. sinicus has been evaluated by analyzing expression level
   changes of genes involved in defense and detoxification systems. Results
   show that C sinicus is more resistant to a diet of this diatom species
   in terms of gene expression patterns, compared to the congeneric species
   Calanus helgolandicus which is an important constituent of the temperate
   waters of the Atlantic Ocean and northern Mediterranean Sea. These
   findings contribute to the better understanding of genetic and/or
   phenotypic flexibility of copepod species and their capabilities to cope
   with stress by identifying molecular markers (such as stress and
   detoxification genes) as biosensors for environmental perturbations
   (e.g. toxins and contaminants) affecting marine copepods. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {Fluorescence polarization (FP) is a powerful tool for studying molecular
   interactions by monitoring changes in the apparent size of fluorescent
   molecules. In this paper, a previously described fluorescence
   polarization assay was used to detect 13,19-didesmethyl C spirolide. The
   assay is based on the competition of cyclic imine marine biotoxins with
   alpha-bungarotoxin for binding to nicotinic acetylcholine
   receptor-enriched membranes of Torpedo marmorata. The 13,19-didesmethyl
   C spirolide was detected in buffer and mussel matrix. The sensitivity of
   the assay for the 13,19-didesmethyl C spirolide and the 13-desmethyl C
   spirolide was similar. After an acetone/chloroform extraction of spiked
   mussel meat, the average recovery rate of 13,19-didesmethyl C spirolide
   was 77.7 +/- 1.9\%. The quantification range for this toxin in mussel
   was 40-200 mu g/kg of shellfish meat. This assay can be used to detect
   the spirolides 13,19-didesmethyl C spirolide and 13-desmethyl C
   spirolide, in shellfish as a screening assay. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Several investigators have documented that the marine phytoplankter
   Phaeocystis pouchetii produce and excrete some compound that has adverse
   effects on its surroundings, but the chemical composition and structure
   of the active agent has so far been unknown. In the present study we
   used mass spectrometry to investigate the structural properties of the
   putative toxin. Colonial cells of P. pouchetii were collected along the
   coast of northern Norway and cultivated in the lab for a limited period
   of time prior to harvesting by filtration. Harvested cells and culture
   filtrate were extracted separately with organic solvents, and a yeast
   cell bioassay was used to track the toxic fractions during extraction
   and purification with HPLC. We found the organic extract from the
   culture filtrate to be toxic, and after purification with RP-HPLC the
   cytotoxic activity was recovered as one fraction. When the toxic
   fractions were pooled and analysed by GC-MS we were able to identify
   2-trans-4-trans-decadienal by comparing retention time and fragmentation
   pattern to a commercial standard. This is the first report of a
   polyunsaturated aldehyde produced by a marine alga belonging to the
   class Haptophyceae, and this implies that production and release of
   these reactive compounds are not limited to diatoms. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {Evidence of selection for resistance to paralytic shellfish toxins

Year = {2010},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {This study identifies early, postmetamorphic soft-shell clams, Mya
   arenaria, as the life-history stage most susceptible to effects of
   blooms of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxin-producing
   Alexandrium spp. Laboratory experiments used progeny from predominantly
   susceptible (naive) or resistant (annually exposed) NW Atlantic
   populations. Growth and survival of toxified veliger larvae did not
   differ from those fed nontoxic algae. In contrast, postlarvae (4-12-mm
   shell length) from both populations exposed to a highly toxic
   Alexandrium tamarense isolate (similar to 100 cells mL(-1), 64-69 pg
   saxitoxin equivalents {[}STXeq] cell(-1)) suffered burrowing
   incapacitation, toxin accumulation, and mortalities within 1 week of
   toxin exposure. These effects were greater and occurred sooner in the
   naive population. Short-term toxification in the laboratory caused a
   significant shift in the genotypic composition of this population,
   determined with a molecular marker for sodium-channel resistance. Clams
   with the sensitive genotype were selectively eliminated relative to
   resistant or heterozygote clams. Ingestion of toxic cells (too large for
   larval capture) is thus required to elicit toxic effects. Exposure to
   mixed, toxic, and nontoxic algal suspensions demonstrated that adverse
   effects to fitness (survival and growth) were dose-dependent, occurring
   only at >= 50 cells mL(-1) of the isolate used (PR18b). Paralysis and
   thus increased predatory risk occurred even at 10 cells mL(-1).
   Postlarvae < 12 mm, which can co-occur with red tides throughout the
   Atlantic range of M. arenaria, were more susceptible to PSP than large
   (> 30 mm) juveniles. Natural selection for resistance in Atlantic
   populations will thus vary latitudinally with the timing, duration, and
   intensity of toxic blooms.},

Title = {Systemic protection through enhanced immunity and antioxidant defenses
   in immune-primed Mytilus coruscus: Insights from cell/ tissue-specific
   analyses},
Journal = {FISH \& SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {159},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Marine mussels are constantly exposed to pathogens and have to evolve
   robust immune systems to recognize, tolerate and clear infections.
   Recent studies have highlighted the phenomenon of `immune priming' and
   its role in enhanced immunity in invertebrate. Yet, there is still a
   lack of experimental evidence on mussels of economic value. This study
   investigated the potential protective effects of immune priming in
   hemocytes and key tissues of marine mussels (Mytilus coruscus) which
   were repeatedly challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, focusing on
   systemic responses in survival, immune functions and antioxidant
   responses. The results indicated that, hemocytes, as the immune cells in
   mussels, initiated the immune function against Vibrio through pathogen
   recognition. Subsequently, toxin efflux and immune defenses were
   precisely regulated by promoting the inflammatory response and cell
   apoptosis to eliminate Vibrio and infected host cells. In parallel,
   antioxidant defense was coordinated to mitigate the potential oxidative
   stress generated during immune process. Further analysis revealed
   tissue-specific immune responses, with gill and digestive gland showing
   differential responses compared to hemocytes. Immune tolerance in gills
   was observed, while digestive glands exhibited sustained immune and
   antioxidant responses, supporting the idea that these tissues play
   distinct roles in maintaining homeostasis and combating pathogens. As
   the result, mussels in the immune-primed group exhibited slower
   mortality and maintained higher hemocyte viability compared to the
   non-primed ones, suggesting that immune priming in mussels can provide
   systemic protection by enhancing both cellular immunity and antioxidant
   defense. The results offer valuable insights into improving disease
   resistance in mussels' aquaculture systems.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Spirolides are a group of cyclic imine marine toxins recently described.
   Although no human intoxication has been related to their presence in
   shellfish yet, the possible toxicological consequences to human health
   are actually unknown. The elucidation of the spirolide mechanism/s of
   action would help to estimate the threat to human consumers. Previous
   toxicological studies in mice suggested the involvement of acetylcholine
   receptors. In this work, the effects of the 13-desmethyl C spirolide on
   the activity and the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
   (mAChR) were analyzed using a human neuroblastoma cell model. The
   13-desmethyl C spirolide inhibited the acetylcholine-induced calcium
   signal with a reduction of the maximum response to acetylcholine in the
   presence of the toxin. The 13-desmethyl C spirolide also reduced binding
   of the mAChR specific antagonist {[}H-3]QNB to neuroblastoma cells. The
   effect of the 13-desmethyl C spirolide persisted after toxin removal and
   was inhibited by protection of the primary binding site with high
   concentrations of atropine suggesting an interaction of the spirolide
   with the orthologous binding site of mAChR. Moreover, the toxin induced
   a change in the characteristics of the membrane-associated M3 mAChRs,
   although it did not alter the total levels of M3 mAChR protein. The
   13-desmethyl C spirolide targets mAChRs causing a reduction of function,
   a decrease of specific antagonist binding to mAChRs, and alteration of
   membrane-bound receptors that might have important toxicological
   implications.},

Abstract = {Prorocentrum lima, a frequent harmful algal bloom species, secretes
   diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) that cause severe human
   gastrointestinal disorders. This study investigated a peroxymonosulfate
   (PMS)-based advanced oxidation process utilizing sulfate radicals for
   simultaneous algal inactivation and toxin degradation, addressing the
   current research gap in marine algal control. Microscopic analyses
   (optical/SEM) revealed structural disintegration and cytoplasmic leakage
   in treated cells. The observed 45.55-69.24 \% reduction in chlorophyll a
   concentration critically impaired photosynthetic activity and DSTs
   biosynthesis. A 94.68 \% decrease in viable cell ratio after 5 h PMS
   exposure confirmed effective algal eradication. Complementary mouse
   bioassays and LCMS quantification demonstrated progressive toxin
   detoxification, evidenced by extended survival times and reduced DSTs
   concentrations. Membrane integrity analysis showed characteristic
   oxidative stress responses: malondialdehyde (MDA) levels surged during
   initial exposure (0-15 min), followed by superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   activity elevation (15-30 min) as cellular defense activation. The
   combined cell mortality and toxin attenuation confirm the dual efficacy
   of this approach. This cost-effective, operationally simple method
   presents a viable strategy for mitigating P. lima blooms and associated
   toxin hazards in marine environments.},

   shellfish toxins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1373},

Abstract = {In the present study, okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1)
   were spiked into artificial seawater at low, medium and high estuarine
   salinities (9 parts per thousand, 13.5 parts per thousand and 27 parts
   per thousand). Passive samplers (HP2O resin) used for solid phase
   adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) technology were exposed in these
   seawaters for 12-h periods. Adsorption curves well fitted a
   pseudo-secondary kinetics model. The highest initial sorption rates of
   both toxins occurred in the seawater of medium salinity, followed by
   seawater of low and high estuarine salinity. Pore volumes of micropores
   (<2 nm) and small mesopores (2 nm < diameter <10 nm) of HP2O resin
   decreased after adsorption of toxins in seawater at high and low
   salinity but not in seawater at medium salinity, which demonstrated that
   the toxin molecules entered into micropores and mesopores (below 10 nm
   in size) in seawaters of high and low salinity. More toxin or other
   matrix agglomerates were displayed on the surface of resin deployed in
   the seawater of medium salinity. Taking into consideration the pore-size
   distribution and surface images, it appears that intra-particle
   diffusion governs toxin adsorption in seawater at high salinity while
   film diffusion mainly controls the adsorption process in seawater at
   medium salinity. This is the first study to confirm that molecules of OA
   and DTX1 are able to enter into micropores (<2 nm) and small mesopores
   (2-10 nm) of HP2O resin in estuarine seawater with high salinity
   (similar to 27\%.). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Novel Non-paralytic Shellfish Toxin and Non-spirolide Toxicity to
   Finfish, Brine Shrimp, and Rotifer Observed in a Culture of the
   Dinoflagellate Alexandrium insuetum Isolated From the Coastal
   Water of China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {The genus Alexandrium is one of the major harmful algal blooms
   (HABs)-forming dinoflagellate group and at least half of similar to 40
   described species have been reported to produce paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs). The potentially harmful species Alexandrium insuetum has
   been reported from many countries of Asia and Europe, and to have
   paralytic shellfish poisoning toxicity, but no mortality of marine
   animals was observed during its bloom. Therefore, it is ecologically
   important to characterize the possible toxicity and toxins of this
   organism. In this study, based on the establishment of two clonal
   cultures through cyst germination collected from the Yellow Sea, we
   identified A. insuetum from China as the first record via light
   microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and
   phylogenetic analyses. The cultures of A. insuetum were further observed
   to be toxic to finfish and zooplankton and deleterious to rotifer eggs
   via laboratory bioassays. The exposure bioassays using rotifer
   (Brachionus plicatilis), brine shrimp (Artemia salina), and larval
   finfish (Oryzias melastigma) demonstrated that A. insuetum caused
   significant lethal effects on finfish and zooplankton species. Rotifer
   bioassays using cell-free culture medium, heat-treated cultures, and
   water, methanol, and trichloromethane extracts of algal cells revealed
   that A. insuetum produced heat-labile, water-soluble toxin(s) that could
   be excreted from A. insuetum cells and steadily accumulated in the
   medium during the growth phases. Hatching success of rotifer eggs was
   also found to be seriously affected by the exposure to A. insuetum.
   Importantly, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry {[}UPLC (or LC)-MS-MS] analyses suggest the above-described
   toxicity of A. insuetum was caused by neither PSTs nor spiroimines
   (13-desmethyl spirolide C and gymnodimine). Collectively, our findings
   demonstrated the novel toxicity to finfish and zooplankton in A.
   insuetum, which is ecologically important in not only possibly
   contributing to population dynamics and even the formation of HABs of
   the species, but also affecting the on-the-spot survival and the
   reproduction potency of marine animals. The present work is believed to
   set a cornerstone for the monitoring and risk assessment of the species
   along the coastal waters of China and for understanding the general
   ecology of A. insuetum.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {469},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by some marine
   dinoflagellates can cause severe human intoxication via vectors like
   bivalves. Toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum produce a novel
   group of hydroxybenzoate PSTs named GC toxins, but their biokinetics in
   bivalves haven't been well examined. In this experiment, we analyzed
   PSTs in bay scallops Argopecten irradians exposed to G. catenatum
   (strain MEL11) to determine their accumulation, elimination, anatomical
   distribution, and biotransformation. To our surprise, up to 30\% of the
   PSTs were accumulated in the adductor muscle of scallops at the end of
   the experiment, and the toxicity of adductor muscle exceeded the
   regulatory limit of 800 mu g STXeq/kg in only 6 days. High concentration
   of toxins in the adductor muscle are likely linked to the rapid transfer
   of GC toxins from viscera to other tissues. Moreover, most GC toxins in
   scallops were found rapidly transformed to decarbamoyl toxins through
   enzyme-mediated hydrolysis, which was further supported by the in vitro
   incubation experiments. Our study demonstrates that GC toxins actively
   participate in toxin distribution and transformation in scallops, which
   may increase the risks of food poisoning associated with the consumption
   of scallop adductor muscle. Environmental implication: The negative
   impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a global
   environmental concern under the joint effects of cultural eutrophication
   and climate change. Our study, targeted on},

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},

Abstract = {Prorocentrum lima is a cosmopolitan benthic dinoflagellate capable of
   producing the diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) okadaic acid (OA) and
   dinophysistoxin (DTX). These compounds may cause oxidative stress and
   accumulate in bivalve tissues, which become vectors of intoxication to
   human consumers. We investigated DST accumulation, detoxification and
   oxidative stress biomarkers in clams (Anomalocardia flexuosa)
   experimentally exposed to P. lima cells or their compounds. Experimental
   diets consisted of 6000 cells mL(-1) of the non-toxic chlorophyte
   Tetraselmis sp. (C; control condition), and combinations of C with 10 P.
   lima cells mL(-1) (T10), 100 P. lima cells mL(-1) (T100), or to a toxin
   concentration of similar to 4 mu g OA L-1 and similar to 0.65 mu g DTX-1
   L-1 (T100d). Clams were exposed to these diets for 7 days (uptake
   phase), followed by a 7-day depuration period. No DSTs were detected in
   clams exposed to treatments C (control) nor to T100d (dissolved
   compounds) during either uptake or detoxification phase. Conversely,
   clams exposed to T10 or T100 accumulated, on average, up to 2.5 and 35
   mu g DST kg(-1) in their whole bodies at the end of the uptake phase.
   These concentrations are similar to 64 and similar to 4.5 times lower
   than the regulatory level of 160 mu g OA kg(-1), respectively.
   Accumulated OA quotas were 12-22 times higher in the digestive gland
   (DG) than in remaining tissues over the uptake phase. Quick toxin
   transformation was indicated by the early detection of conjugated
   compounds - DTX-1 and OA esters - in the DG after 6 h of exposure, with
   OA-ester representing the main compound (30 -100 \%) in that tissue over
   the experiment. During the depuration period, detoxification rates
   represented 0.024 h(-1), 0.04 h(-1) and 0.052 h(-1) for OA, DTX-1 and
   OA-ester, respectively. The activities of catalase, glutathione
   S-transferase, glutathione pemxidase and the levels of oxidative stress
   by lipoperoxidation varied similarly in the DG of A. flexuosa
   individuals subjected to T100, T100d and the control condition. However,
   contrasting antioxidant responses were measured in those exposed to T10.
   These findings indicate that no oxidative stress was primarily induced
   by DST-producing dinoflagellates in this clam species under laboratory
   conditions representative of toxic bloom situations. Even though,
   possible interactions should be considered under multistressor
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {The first diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) red tide associated with
   the dinoflagellate Dinophysis norvegica recorded for eastern Canada
   occurred in Bedford Basin from 20 July to 3 August 1990. The abundance
   of D. norvegica was up to ca 0.5 x 10(6) cells l-1, which is the highest
   ever reported. It constituted up to 88 \% of the total diatoms and
   dinoflagellates, and was most abundant at ca 10 m depth in the
   pycnocline at almost all the stations in the Basin. The temporal pattern
   of particle size spectra matched closely the abundance of D. norvegica.
   Okadaic acid (OA) content in the vertical plankton tows ranged from 0.78
   to 6.08 mug OA g-1 dry plankton. The OA in the digestive tract of
   exposed experimental scallops Placopecten magellanicus was 320 ng g-1 on
   27 July and increased to 469 ng g-1 on 3 August 1990. The toxin's
   temporal distribution in scallops was the inverse of that in the
   plankton samples. OA content in scallops increased in spite of its
   decrease in plankton, which suggests that the scallops accumulated OA
   but depurated slowly. The potential for a DSP episode exists in Nova
   Scotian waters if a similar growth of toxicogenic D. norvegica occurs in
   areas of consumable molluscs.},

Pages = {22-31},

Abstract = {Aquatic organisms are constantly exposed to both physical (e.g.
   temperature and salinity variations) and chemical (e.g. endocrine
   disruptor chemicals, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, diatom toxins, and
   other toxicants) stressors which they react to by activating a series of
   defense mechanisms. This paper reviews the literature on the defense
   systems, including detoxification enzymes and proteins (e.g. glutathione
   S-transferases, heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase and catalase),
   studied in copepods at the molecular level. The data indicate high
   inter- and intra-species variability in copepod response, depending on
   the type of stressor tested, the concentration and exposure time, and
   the enzyme isoform studied. Ongoing -omics approaches will allow the
   identification of new genes which will give a more comprehensive
   overview of how copepods respond to specific stressors in laboratory
   and/or field conditions and the effects of these responses on higher
   trophic levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multibiomarker-based assessment of toxicity of central European strains
   of filamentous cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon gracile and
   Raphidiopsis raciborskii to zebrafish Danio rerio},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The global increase in cyanobacterial blooms poses environmental and
   health threats. Selected cyanobacterial strains reveal toxicities
   despite a lack of synthesis of known toxic metabolites, and the
   mechanisms of these toxicities are not well understood. Here we
   investigated the toxicity of non-cylindrospermopsin and non-microcystin
   producing Aphanizomenon gracile and Raphidiopsis raciborskii of Central
   European origin to zebrafish exposed for 14 days to their extracts.
   Toxicological screening revealed the presence of anabaenopeptins and a
   lack of anatoxin-a, beta-methylamino-L-alanine or saxitoxins in examined
   extracts. The responses were compared to 20 mu g L-1 of common
   cyanobacterial toxins cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and microcystin-LR
   (MC-LR). The expression of the marker genes involved in apoptosis
   (caspase 3a and 3b, Bcl-2, BAX, p53, MAPK, Nrf2), DNA damage detection
   and repair (GADD45, RAD51, JUN, XPC), detoxification (CYP1A, CYP26,
   EPHX1), lipid metabolism (PPARa, FABP1, PLA2),
   phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (PPP6C, PPM1) and cytoskeleton (actin,
   tubulin) were examined using targeted transcriptomics. Cellular stress
   and toxicity biomarkers (oxidative injury, antioxidant enzymes, thiol
   pool status, and lactate dehydrogenase activity) were measured in the
   liver, and acetylcholinesterase activity was determined as an index of
   neurotoxicity in the brain. The extracts of three cyanobacterial strains
   that produce no known cyanotoxins caused marked toxicity in D. rerio,
   and the biomarker profiles indicate different toxic mechanisms between
   the bioactive compounds extracted from these strains and the purified
   cyanotoxins. All studied cyanobacterial extracts and purified
   cyanotoxins induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, downregulated
   Nrf2 and CYP26B1, disrupted phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes
   and actin/tubulin cytoskeleton and upregulated apoptotic activity in the
   liver. The tested strains and purified toxins displayed distinctively
   different effects on lipid metabolism. Unlike CYN and MC-LR, the Central
   European strain of A. gracile and R. raciborskii did not reveal a
   genotoxic potential. These findings help to further understand the
   ecotoxicological consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in
   freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A polyether antibiotic, ecteinamycin (1), was isolated from a marine
   Actinomadura sp., cultivated from the ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata.
   C-13 enrichment, high resolution NMR spectroscopy, and molecular
   modeling enabled elucidation of the structure of 1, which was validated
   on the basis of comparisons with its recently reported crystal
   structure. Importantly, ecteinamycin demonstrated potent activity
   against the toxigenic strain of Clostridium difficile NAP1/B1/027 (MIC =
   59 ng/mu L), as well as other toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. difficile
   isolates both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, chemical genomics
   studies using Escherichia coli barcoded deletion mutants led to the
   identification of sensitive mutants such as trkA and kdpD involved in
   potassium cation transport and homeostasis supporting a mechanistic
   proposal that ecteinamycin acts as an ionophore antibiotic. This is the
   first antibacterial agent whose mechanism of action has been studied
   using E. coli chemical genomics. On the basis of these data, we propose
   ecteinamycin as an ionophore antibiotic that causes C. difficile
   detoxification and cell death via potassium transport dysregulation.},

Abstract = {Laboratory and field measurements of the toxin content in Karenia brevis
   cells vary by >4-fold. These differences have been largely attributed to
   genotypic variations in toxin production among strains. We hypothesized
   that nutrient limitation of growth rate is equally or more important in
   controlling the toxicity of K. brevis, as has been documented for other
   toxic algae. To test this hypothesis, we measured cellular growth rate,
   chlorophyll a, cellular carbon and nitrogen, cell volume, and
   brevetoxins in four strains of K. brevis grown in nutrient-replete and
   nitrogen (N)-limited semi-continuous cultures. N-limitation resulted in
   reductions of chlorophyll a, growth rate, volume per cell and
   nirtogen:carbon (N:C) ratios as well as a two-fold increase (1\%4\% to
   5\%9\%) in the percentage of cellular carbon present as brevetoxins. The
   increase in cellular brevetoxin concentrations was consistent among
   genetically distinct strains. Normalizing brevetoxins to cellular volume
   instead of per cell eliminated much of the commonly reported toxin
   variability among strains. These results suggest that genetically linked
   differences in cellular volume may affect the toxin content of K. brevis
   cells as much or more than innate genotypic differences in cellular
   toxin content per unit of biomass. Our data suggest at least some of the
   >4-fold difference in toxicity per cell reported from field studies can
   be explained by limitation by nitrogen or other nutrients and by
   differences in cell size. The observed increase in brevetoxins in
   nitrogen limited cells is consistent with the carbon:nutrient balance
   hypothesis for increases in toxins and other plant defenses under
   nutrient limitation.},

Title = {Assessment of the sub-lethal impacts of Karenia brevis on
   hard clams, Mercenaria campechiensis},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {143},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Karenia brevis, a toxin-producing dinoflagellate, has been implicated in
   frequent harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Gulf of Mexico. Shellfish
   species, such as Mercenaria campechiensis, have high resilience to K.
   brevis exposure causing high accumulation and retention of brevetoxins
   within their tissues. The current study aimed to analyze the
   accumulation and depuration of brevetoxins in M. campechiensis exposed
   to 100,000 cells L-1 for two weeks. The second aim was to identify the
   potential detoxification enzymes in M. campechiensis as well as
   potential enzymes representative of stress to see if moderate
   concentrations lead to stress in exposed M. campechiensis. This was done
   by exposing M. campechiensis to a continuous flow of K. brevis, followed
   by a 47-day depuration period. There was an increase in brevetoxin
   concentration during the exposure with a rapid decrease at the onset of
   the depuration period. This was followed by a gradual decrease with
   detectable toxins in the exposed clam tissue for the duration of the
   experiment. While there was detectable toxin during the depurations, the
   concentrations were below the NSP level for BTX-2 by day 14 indicating
   M. campechiensis would potentially be safe for consumption after two
   weeks following exposure to a moderate K. brevis concentration. Fold
   change of AChE activity significantly increased in the exposure tank
   when compared to the controls following the exposure period. Fold change
   of GST activity from control significantly decreased in the exposure
   tank compared to the controls on 14 d exposure. Both changes in enzyme
   activity support the findings that a moderate concentration of K. brevis
   may induce stress in M. campechiensis. Ultimately, the results of the
   current study further highlight the importance of the K. brevis
   regulatory limits as it can prevent possible neurotoxic shellfish
   poisoning in people who eat contaminated shellfish as it prevents the
   consumption of shellfish exposed to moderate and high concentrations of
   K. brevis.},

Abstract = {To understand the biokinetics and potential risks of
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites,
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), in fish, we exposed the black
   sea breams (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) to aqueous and dietary DDTs and
   then evaluated the bioaccumulation, distribution, biotransformation, and
   elimination of DDTs under controlled laboratory conditions. The fish
   rapidly accumulated DDTs from both routes of exposure, particularly the
   gills and viscera. Elimination of DDTs following aqueous or dietary
   uptake was slow, and biotranslocation of DDTs was significant during the
   exposure period but negligible during the depuration period. The
   biotransformation process was more significant following dietary
   exposure. During depuration, DDE was the major biotransformed product in
   the sea breams' carcasses while DDD was the major product in the gills
   and viscera. However, DDD had a significantly higher elimination rate
   than DDE and, subsequently, the fish retained more DDE in the body.
   Intraspecies variability in the elimination and biotransformation
   processes in fish was observed. We demonstrated that the route of
   exposure significantly affected the fate and biokinetics of DDTs in
   fish. The application of a dynamic model provided a tool for quantifying
   the elimination and biotransformation of DDT in fish. The present study
   provided insights into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation
   pathways of DDT in fish that could have important ecotoxicological
   implications.},

Abstract = {Contamination of shellfish with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins produced by Alexandrium species poses a potential threat to the
   sustainability of the Scottish aquaculture industry. Routine LM analysis
   of water samples from around the Scottish coast has previously
   identified Alexandrium (Dinophyceae) as a regular part of the spring and
   summer phytoplankton communities in Scottish coastal waters. In this
   study, Alexandrium tamarense (M. Lebour) Balech isolated from sediment
   and water samples was established in laboratory culture. Species
   identification of these isolates was confirmed using thecal plate
   dissections and by molecular characterization based on their LSU and, in
   some cases, ITS rDNA sequence. Molecular characterization and
   phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of two ribotypes of A.
   tamarense: Group I (North American ribotype) and Group III (Western
   European ribotype). Assessment of PSP toxin production using hydrophilic
   interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS)
   showed that A. tamarense Group I produced a complex array of toxins
   (similar to 2,000 fg STX equivalents . cell(-1)) with the major toxins
   being C2, neosaxitoxin (NEO), saxitoxin (STX), gonyautoxin-4 (GTX-4),
   and GTX-3, while A. tamarense Group III did not produce toxins.
   Historically, it was considered that all Alexandrium species occurring
   in Scottish waters produce potent PSP toxins. This study has highlighted
   the presence of both PSP toxin-producing and benign species of A.
   tamarense and questions the ecological significance of this finding.},

Title = {Complementary mechanisms for neurotoxin resistance in a copepod},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Toxin resistance is a recurring evolutionary response by predators
   feeding on toxic prey. These adaptations impact physiological
   interaction and community ecology. Mechanisms for resistance vary
   depending on the predator and the nature of the toxin. Potent
   neurotoxins like tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) that are highly
   toxic to humans and other vertebrates, target conserved voltage-gated
   sodium channels (Na-V) of nerve and muscle, causing paralysis. The
   copepod Calanus finmarchicus consumes the STX-producing dinoflagellate,
   Alexandrium fundyense with no effect on survival. Using transcriptomic
   approaches to search for the mechanism that confers resistance in C.
   finmarchicus, we identified splice variants of Na(V)s that were
   predicted to be toxin resistant. These were co-expressed with putatively
   non-resistant form in all developmental stages. However its expression
   was unresponsive to toxin challenge nor was there any up-regulation of
   genes involved in multi-xenobiotic resistance (MXR) or detoxification
   (phases I or II). Instead, adults consistently regulated genes encoding
   digestive enzymes, possibly to complement channel resistance by limiting
   toxin assimilation via the digestive process. The nauplii, which were
   more susceptible to STX, did not regulate these enzymes. This study
   demonstrates how deep-sequencing technology can elucidate multiple
   mechanisms of toxin resistance concurrently, revealing the linkages
   between molecular/cellular adaptations and the ecology of an organism.},

Title = {Identifying best methods for routine ELISA detection of microcystin in
   seafood},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ingestion of water contaminated with the cyanotoxin, microcystin (MC),
   can pose serious health risks to humans. MC is also known to accumulate
   in seafood; however, this exposure pathway is much less understood. A
   fundamental element of this uncertainty is related to analytical
   difficulties. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
   (ELISAs) offer one of the best options for routine MC detection, but
   methods of detecting MC in tissue are far from standardized. We spiked
   freshwater finfish and marine mussel tissues with MC, then compared
   recovery rates using four different preparation protocols and two ELISA
   types (polyclonal anti-MC-ADDA/direct monoclonal (DM)). Preparation
   protocol, type of ELISA, and seafood tissue variety significantly
   affected MC detection. This is the first known study to use DM ELISA for
   tissue analyses, and our findings demonstrate that DM ELISA combined
   with a short solvent extraction results in fewer false positives than
   other commonly used methods. This method can be used for rapid and
   reliable MC detection in seafood.},

Title = {Prevalence and persistence of gymnodimines in clams from the Gulf of

Abstract = {In this work we studied the toxicity in clams from the Gulf of Gabes,
   Tunisia (Southern Mediterranean). Samples from two stations (M2 and S6)
   were collected monthly from January 2009 to September 2010, and analyzed
   by the official control method of mousse bioassay (MBA) for lipophilic
   toxins. All samples were also analyzed with the LC-MS/MS method for the
   determination of lipophilic toxins, namely: okadaic acid group,
   pectenotoxins, yessotoxins and azaspiracids, spirolides and gymnodimines
   (GYMS). The results showed prevalence of GYMs since it was the only
   toxin group identified in these samples with a maximum of 2136 mu g
   GYM-A kg(-1) (February 2009 at M2). Furthermore, GYMs showed persistence
   in the area, with only one blank sample below the limit of detection.
   Interestingly, this blank sample was found in June 2009 after an
   important toxic episode which supports the recent findings regarding the
   high detoxification capability of clams, much faster than that reported
   for oysters. In comparison, good agreement was found among MBA, the LD50
   value of 80-100 mu g kg(-1) reported for GYM-A, and quantitative results
   provided by LC-MS/MS. On the contrary to that previously reported for
   Tunisian clams, we unambiguously identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS
   the isomers GYM-B/C in most samples. Phytoplankton identification and
   enumeration of Karenia selliformis usually showed higher densities at
   site M2 than 56 as expected bearing in mind toxin results, although
   additional results would be required to improve the correlation between
   K. selliformis densities and quantitative results of toxins. The
   prevalence and persistence of GYMs in this area at high levels strongly
   encourages the evaluation of the chronic toxic effects of GYMs. This is
   especially important taking into account that relatively large
   quantities of GYMS can be released into the market due to the
   replacement of the official control method from mouse bioassay to the
   LC-MS/MS for lipophilic toxins (Regulation (EU) No. 15/2011), and the
   lack of regulation for this group of toxins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Estuarine areas represent complex and highly changing environments at
   the interface between freshwater and marine aquatic ecosystems.
   Therefore, the aquatic organisms living in estuaries have to face highly
   variable environmental conditions. The aim of this work was to study the
   influence of environmental changes from either natural or anthropogenic
   origins on the physiological responses of Mytilus edulis. Mussels were
   collected in the Vilaine estuary during early summer because this season
   represents a critical period of active reproduction in mussels and of
   increased anthropogenic inputs from agricultural and boating activities
   into the estuary. The physiological status of the mussel M. edulis was
   evaluated through measurements of a suite of biomarkers related to:
   oxidative stress (catalase, malondialdehyde), detoxication (benzopyrene
   hydroxylase, carboxylesterase), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase),
   reproductive cycle (vitelline, condition index, maturation stages),
   immunotoxicity (hemocyte concentration, granulocyte percentage,
   phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, oxidative burst), and
   general physiological stress (lysosomal stability). A selection of
   relevant organic contaminant (pesticides, (polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls) was measured as well as environmental
   parameters (water temperature, salinity, total suspended solids,
   turbidity, chlorophyll a, pheopigments) and mussel phycotoxin
   contamination. Two locations differently exposed to the plume of the
   Vilaine River were compared. Both temporal and inter-site variations of
   these biomarkers were studied. Our results show that reproduction cycle
   and environmental parameters such as temperature, organic ontaminants,
   and algal blooms could strongly influence the biomarker responses. These
   observations highlight the necessity to conduct integrated environmental
   approaches in order to better understand the causes of biomarker
   variations.},

Abstract = {The most proactive approach to resolving current health and climate
   crises will require a long view, focused on establishing and fostering
   partnerships to identify and eliminate root causes of the disconnect
   between humans and nature. We describe the lessons learned through a
   unique scientific partnership that addresses a specific crisis, harmful
   algal blooms (HABs), along the northeast Pacific Ocean coast, that
   blends current-day technology with observational knowledge of Indigenous
   communities. This integrative scientific strategy resulted in creative
   solutions for forecasting and managing HAB risk in the Pacific Northwest
   as a part of the US Ocean and Human Health (OHH) program. Specific OHH
   projects focused on: (1) understanding genetic responses of tribal
   members to toxins in the marine environment, (2) knowledge sharing by
   elders during youth camps; (3) establishing an early warning program to
   alert resource managers of HABs are explicit examples of proactive
   strategies used to address environmental problems. The research and
   monitoring projects with tribal communities taught the collaborating
   non-Indigenous scientists the value of reciprocity, highlighting both
   the benefits from and protection of oceans that promote our well-being.
   Effective global oceans and human health initiatives require a
   collective action that gives equal respect to all voices to promote

Title = {Comparative dynamics of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) in a tolerant

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {245-253},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In common-environment experiments, we measured the uptake, accumulation,
   retention, transformation and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs) of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense in adult females of
   two geographically separated populations (Maine and New Jersey, USA) of
   the copepod Acartia hudsonica. These populations were previously shown
   to differ in their history of exposure to Alexandrium blooms, and in
   their degree of adaptation to this dinoflagellate. Toxin accumulation
   was measured at several times in incubations lasting up to 72 h. Toxin
   depuration was assessed after a 60 h incubation of females with toxic A.
   fundyense and subsequent 60 h incubation in a sole diet of the non-toxic
   green flagellate Tetraselmis sp. As previously observed, the Maine
   population had significantly higher toxin ingestion rates. By contrast,
   both toxin accumulation (up to similar to 2.5 ng STX eq. female(-1)) and
   the depuration rate (similar to 0.73 d(-1)) were not significantly
   different between populations. Hence, faster depuration is ruled out as
   a tolerance mechanism in the Maine population. Some toxin transformation
   during both accumulation and depuration was evident in both populations.
   However, differential toxin transformation does not appear to be a
   tolerance mechanism either. In contrast to these results, toxin
   retention (ratio of accumulation/cumulative ingestion) was significantly
   lower in the Maine population. The retentions of gonyautoxin 3 (GTX3)
   and of two of the most potent toxins, neosaxitoxin (NEO) and saxitoxin
   (STX), were also significantly lower in that population. At steady
   state, toxin absorption efficiency was estimated to be 6\% for the Maine
   population and 9\% for the New Jersey population. These results suggest
   that lower toxin absorption is a possible tolerance mechanism for the
   Maine population. The results of the present study also suggest that
   copepod adaptation to toxic dinoflagellates does not necessarily lead to
   higher toxin transfer up the food web. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Summer dynamics of Alexandrium ostenfeldii (Dinophyceae) and
   spirolide toxins in Cork Harbour, Ireland},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {425},
Pages = {21-33},
Abstract = {Proliferations of toxic Alexandrium spp. have adversely affected the
   shellfish aquaculture industry worldwide. A. ostenfeldii can produce
   several biotoxins, including the recently characterised fast-acting
   toxins spirolides (SPX). A dual labelling fluorescent in situ
   hybridisation (FISH) assay was developed for discriminating
   simultaneously between the closely related taxa A. ostenfeldii and A.
   peruvianum. Surveys were undertaken throughout the summers of 2006, 2007
   and 2008 in Cork Harbour, Ireland, where a mixed community of
   Alexandrium spp. develops annually. A. peruvianum was not detected but
   the presence of A. ostenfeldii was confirmed by FISH and morphological
   analysis. The species never reached high concentrations (max. similar to
   200 cells l(-1)) and contributed on average to only 0.4\% of the
   Alexandrium community, usually dominated by A. minutum and A. tamarense
   (Group III). Although cell concentrations were several orders of
   magnitude lower, the dynamics of A. ostenfeldii were similar to those of
   other Alexandrium spp. during the 3 consecutive summers, suggesting a
   common response to environmental forcing. Analytical chemistry performed
   on extracts from passive solid-phase adsorption samplers identified
   lipophilic toxins dominated by okadaic acid, but also 13-desmethyl SPX C
   and 20-methyl SPX G, with dynamics generally congruent with those of A.
   ostenfeldii. The passive samplers enabled the quantification of
   background toxin levels at very low A. ostenfeldii concentrations,
   showing potential for forecasting of toxic events. The ability to
   quantify toxic A. ostenfeldii cells within high density microalgal
   populations of morphologically similar species makes the dual FISH assay
   valuable for phytoplankton monitoring programs and future
   biogeographical and population dynamics studies.},

   through the marine food web and ultimately cause massive deaths of
   piscivorous predators. However, very few studies have explored the
   processes of accumulation and biotransformation of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs) within fishes. White seabream (Diplodus sargus) were
   orally challenged with contaminated cockles (Cerastoderma edule)
   containing N-sulfocarbamoyl and decarbamoyl toxins and non-contaminated
   cockles afterwards. Specific PSTs that occurred in low abundance in
   cockles (B1 7.6\% and dcSTX 1.6\% molar fraction) were the only toxins
   detected in fish viscera possibly resulting from selective elimination
   and transformation of the various PSTs. Concentration of toxins
   progressively increased in fish viscera throughout the uptake period.
   Toxins were then rapidly depurated (B1 0.905 day(-1), dcSTX 0.467
   day(-1)) when diet was changed to non-toxic cockles. Results indicate
   conversion of a precursor toxin into B1 which in turn might be converted
   into dcSTX at a lower extent. Low accumulation efficiency of 1.7 and
   5.0\% was calculated to B1 and dcSTX, respectively. This study
   contributes to a better understanding of dynamics of PSTs in fish and
   the fate of these compounds in the marine food web.},

Abstract = {kappa-Conotoxin-PVIIA (kappa-PVIIA) belongs to a family of peptides
   derived from a hunting marine snail that tar gets to a wide variety of
   ion channels and receptors. kappa-PVIIA is a small, structurally
   constrained, 27-residue peptide that inhibits voltage-gated K channels.
   Three disulfide bonds shape a characteristic four-loop folding. The
   spatial localization of positively charged residues in K-PVIIA exhibits
   strong structural mimicry to that of charybdotoxin, a scorpion toxin
   that occludes the pore of K channels. Me studied the mechanism by which
   this peptide inhibits Shaker, K channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes
   with the N-type inactivation removed. Chronically applied to whole
   oocytes or outside-out patches, kappa-PVIIA inhibition appears as a
   voltage-dependent relaxation in response to the depolarizing pulse used
   to activate the channels. At any applied voltage, the relaxation rare
   depended linearly on the toxin concentration, indicating a bimolecular
   stoichiometry. Time constants and voltage dependence of the current
   relaxation produced by chronic applications agreed with that of rapid
   applications to open channels. Effective valence of the voltage
   dependence, z delta, is similar to 0.55 and resides primarily in the
   rare of dissociation from the channel, while the association rate is
   voltage independent with a magnitude of 10(7)-10(8) M-1 s(-1),
   consistent with diffusion-limited binding. Compatible with a purely
   competitive interaction for a site in the external vestibule,
   tetraethylammonium, a well-known Ii-pore blocker, reduced kappa-PVIIA's
   association rate only. Removal of internal K+ reduced, but did not
   eliminate, the effective valence of the toxin dissociation rate to a
   value <0.3. This trans-pore effect suggests that: (a) as in the
   alpha-KTx, a positively changed side chain, possibly a Lys, interacts
   electrostatically with ions residing inside the Shaker pore, and (b) a
   part of the toxin occupies an externally accessible K+ binding site,
   decreasing the degree of pore occupancy by permeant ions, We conclude
   that, although evolutionarily distant to scorpion toxins, kappa-PVIIA
   shares with them a remarkably similar mechanism of inhibition of K
   channels.},

   Monitoring Program in Tasmania, Australia},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) are found in the hepatopancreas of
   Southern Rock Lobster Jasus edwardsii from the east coast of Tasmania in
   association with blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   catenella. Tasmania's rock lobster fishery is one of the state's most
   important wild capture fisheries, supporting a significant commercial
   industry (AUD 97M) and recreational fishing sector. A comprehensive 8
   years of field data collected across multiple sites has allowed
   continued improvements to the risk management program protecting public
   health and market access for the Tasmanian lobster fishery. High
   variability was seen in toxin levels between individuals, sites, months,
   and years. The highest risk sites were those on the central east coast,
   with July to January identified as the most at-risk months. Relatively
   high uptake rates were observed (exponential rate of 2\% per day),
   similar to filter-feeding mussels, and meant that lobster accumulated
   toxins quickly. Similarly, lobsters were relatively fast detoxifiers,
   losing up to 3\% PST per day, following bloom demise. Mussel sentinel
   lines were effective in indicating a risk of elevated PST in lobster
   hepatopancreas, with annual baseline monitoring costing approximately
   0.06\% of the industry value. In addition, it was determined that if the
   mean hepatopancreas PST levels in five individual lobsters from a site
   were <0.22 mg STX equiv. kg(-1), there is a 97.5\% probability that any
   lobster from that site would be below the bivalve maximum level of 0.8
   mg STX equiv. kg(-1). The combination of using a sentinel species to
   identify risk areas and sampling five individual lobsters at a
   particular site, provides a cost-effective strategy for managing PST
   risk in the Tasmanian commercial lobster fishery.},

Title = {Variability and profiles of lipophilic toxins in bivalves from Great
   Britain during five and a half years of monitoring: azaspiracids and
   yessotoxins},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {87},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cefas has been responsible for the delivery of official control biotoxin
   testing of bivalve molluscs from Great Britain for just over a decade.
   Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) methodology
   has been used for the quantitation of lipophilic toxins (LTs) since
   2011. The temporal and spatial distribution of okadaic acid group toxins
   and profiles in bivalves between 2011 and 2016 have been recently
   reported. Here we present data on the two other groups of regulated
   lipophilic toxins, azaspiracids (AZAs) and yessotoxins (YTXs), over the
   same period. The latter group has also been investigated for a potential
   link with Protoceratium reticulatum and Lingulodinium polyedra, both
   previously recognised as YTXs producing phytoplankton.
   On average, AZAs were quantified in 3.2\% of all tested samples but
   notable inter-annual variation in abundance was observed. The majority
   of all AZA contaminated samples were found between July 2011 and August
   2013 in Scotland, while only two, three-month long, AZA events were
   observed in 2015 and 2016 in the south-west of England. Maximum
   concentrations were generally reached in late summer or early autumn.
   Reasons for AZAs persistence during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 winters
   are discussed. Only one toxin profile was identified, represented by
   both AZA1 and AZA2 toxins at an approximate ratio of 2 : 1, suggesting a
   single microalgal species was the source of AZAs in British bivalves.
   Although AZA1 was always the most dominant toxin, its proportion varied
   between mussels, Pacific oysters and surf clams.
   The YTXs were the least represented group among regulated LTs. YTXs were
   found almost exclusively on the south-west coast of Scotland, with the
   exception of 2013, when the majority of contaminated samples originated
   from the Shetland Islands. The highest levels were recorded in the
   summer months and followed a spike in Protoceratium reticulatum cell
   densities. YTX was the most dominant toxin in shellfish, further
   strengthening the link to P. reticulatum as the YTX source. Neither
   homo-YTX, nor 45 - OH homo-YTX were detected throughout the monitored
   period. 45 -OH YTX, thought to be a shellfish metabolite associated with
   YTX elimination, contributed on average 26\% in mussels. Although the
   correlation between 45-OH YTX abundance and the speed of YTX depuration
   could not be confirmed, we noted the half-life of YTX was more than
   two-times longer in queen scallops, which contained 100\% YTX, than in
   mussels. No other bivalve species were affected by YTXs.
   This is the first detailed evaluation of AZAs and YTXs occurrences and
   their profiles in shellfish from Great Britain over a period of multiple
   years.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews the rapidly expanding literature on the ecological
   effects of cyanobacterial toxins. The study employs a qualitative
   meta-analysis from the literature examining results from a large number
   of independent studies and extracts general patterns from the literature
   or signals contradictions. The meta-analysis is set up by putting
   together two large tables - embodying a large and representative part of
   the literature (see Appendix A). The first table (Table A. 1) reviews
   the presence (concentrations) of different cyanobacterial toxins in the
   tissues of various groups of aquatic biota after exposure via different
   routes, experimentally in the lab or via natural routes in the
   environment. The second table (Table A.2) reviews the dose dependent
   effect of toxins on biota. The great majority of studies deal with the
   presence and effects of microcystin, especially of the MC-LR congener.
   Although this may partly be justified - MC-LR is an abundant and highly
   toxic protein - our review also emphasizes what is known about (i) other
   MC congeners (a number of studies showed a preferred accumulation of the
   less toxic variant MC-RR in animal tissues), (ii) nodularin (data on a
   range of biota from studies on the Baltic Sea), (iii) neurotoxins like
   anatoxin-a(s), which are conspicuously often present at times when mass
   mortalities of birds occur, (iv) a few studies on the presence and
   effects of cylindrospermposin, as well as (v) the first examples of
   ecological effects of newly identified bioactive compounds, like
   microviridin-J. Data were reorganized to assess to what extent
   bioconcentration (uptake and concentration of toxins from the water) or
   biomagnification (uptake and concentration via the food) of
   cyanobacterial toxins occurs in ecosystems. There is little support for
   the occurrence of biomagnification, and this reduces the risk for biota
   at higher trophic levels. Rather than biomagnification biodilution seems
   to occur in the foodweb with toxins being subject to degradation and
   excretion at every level. Nevertheless toxins were present at all tropic
   levels, indicating that some vectorial transport must take place, and in
   sufficient quantities for effects to possibly occur. Feeding seemed to
   be the most important route for exposure of aquatic biota to
   cyanobacterial toxins. A fair number of studies focus on dissolved
   toxins, but in those studies purified toxin typically is used, and biota
   do not appear very sensitive to this form of exposure. More effects are
   found when crude cyanobacterial cell lysates are used, indicating that
   there may be synergistic effects between different bioactive compounds.
   Aquatic biota are by no means defenseless against toxic cyanobacteria.
   Several studies indicate that those species that are most frequently
   exposed to toxins in their natural environment are also the most
   tolerant. Protection includes behavioral mechanisms, detoxication of MC
   and NODLN by conjugation with glutathione, and fairly rapid depuration
   and excretion. A common theme in much of the ecological studies is that
   of modulating factors. Effects are seldom straightforward, but are
   dependent on factors like the (feeding) condition of the animals,
   environmental conditions and the history of exposure (acclimation and
   adaptation to toxic cyanobacteria). This makes it harder to generalize
   on what is known about ecological effects of cyanobacterial toxins. The
   paper concludes by summarizing the risks for birds, fish,
   macroinvertebrates and zooplankton.
   Although acute (lethal) effects are mentioned in the literature, mass
   mortalities of -especially fish are more likely to be the result of
   multiple stress factors that co-occur during cyanobacterial blooms.
   Bivalves appear remarkably resistant, whilst the harmful effects of
   cyanobacteria on zooplankton vary widely and the specific contribution
   of toxins is hard to evaluate.},

   wt) and the toxin profile matched that of A. fundyense cells.
   Mean PS toxin levels were low (<4 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt) in
   stomach, gill and muscle tissues of moribund salmon, suggesting that PS
   toxins are very lethal to salmon.
   The PS toxin concentrations in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) growing on
   the salmon cages (37; 526 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt) were the
   highest recorded to date from this region. Their PS toxin profiles
   showed enhanced carbarnate contents (85.5\%) compared with that found in
   A. fundyense. Blue mussels collected from an adjacent Canadian Food
   Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitoring site in Grand Manan had PS toxin
   concentrations of 4214 and 150 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt in late
   September and December, respectively, well above the regulatory limit
   (RL), and horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus) collected in late September
   had PS toxin concentrations of 2357 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt.
   Detoxification under laboratory conditions suggested that blue mussels
   may require up to 19 weeks for elimination below RL when they accumulate
   these high concentrations of PS toxins. This depuration period may be
   shorter in the field.
   PS toxin levels above RL were detected in hepatopancreatic tissues of
   lobster (Homarus americanus), with lower levels (< 16 mu g STX equiv.
   100 g(-1) wet wt) in tail muscle and gills.
   These results illustrate the movement of PS toxins through the marine
   food chain following an A. fundyense bloom in the BoF, and support
   earlier studies suggesting that kills from the region of
   zooplanktivorous fish, such as herring (Clupea harengus harengus), can
   be attributed to blooms of A. fundyense. This is the first reported
   incident of PSP associated with mortalities of caged Atlantic salmon in
   the BoF Analyses of muscle tissues and viscera from the affected salmon
   indicated that any portion would not be a health hazard if consumed.

Title = {Anti-mitotic activity towards sea urchin embryos in extracts from the

Abstract = {The marine bloom-forming alga Phaeocystis pouchetii is suspected to
   produce some toxic compound responsible for reduced growth, fecundity
   and survival of other marine organisms. Sea urchin early development was
   used as a model to investigate the degree and nature of toxicity.
   Colonial cells of P. pouchetii were collected during its spring-bloom
   along the coast of northern Norway and maintained in culture for a short
   period of time in order to evaluate the concentration of toxic compounds
   present inside the cells or excreted to the surrounding seawater medium.
   Cells were harvested by filtration and toxins were extracted separately
   from the collected cells and the filtrate using organic solvents. We
   found that extracts from the filtered seawater at a concentration
   corresponding to 9.0 X 10(5) cells ml(-1) completely blocked cell
   divisions in embryos of the sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis, whereas
   extracts from intact algal cells were only mildly cytotoxic. When the
   extracts from seawater culture medium were purified by RP-HPLC,
   cytotoxic activity towards S. granularis embryos was recovered in three
   consecutive fractions. Moreover, unfertilised eggs incubated in the
   active HPLC fractions became unproductive, whereas incubation of sperm
   gave a reduced fertilisation rate. This anti-proliferative effect was
   further characterized by immunofluorescence staining of sea urchin
   embryos. DNA labelling revealed that incubating sea urchin embryos in
   the purified algal extracts inhibited both pronuclei migration and
   fusion. Incorporation and detection of the DNA-base analogue
   5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine showed that DNA-replication was blocked.
   Furthermore, staining of alpha-tubulin subunits demonstrated that
   embryonic tubulin organisation was altered. We conclude that P.
   pouchetii produce some anti-mitotic compound, and that senescent
   colonial cells to a great extent excrete this compound to their
   surroundings. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia, Eastern Mediterranean sea), the grooved
   carpet shell Ruditapes decussatus has been seen to contain persistent
   levels of gymnodimine (GYM) for several years. The present experimental
   work represents the first attempt to assess detoxification kinetics of
   fast-acting toxins (FAT) in marine molluscs fed specific diets of
   non-toxic algae (Isochrysis galbana).
   To find an optimal detoxification method, two experiments were performed
   in which clams were first fed the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia
   selliformis to artificially contaminate them with GYM, thus simulating
   the effect of natural toxic episodes. As a second step, the same clams
   were fed a non-toxic algae, I. galbana. to speed up the detoxification
   process.
   Changes in toxin content over the whole experiment were assessed by
   liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   analysis.
   The first results revealed (i) faster detoxification rates in digestive
   gland (DG) when clams were fed on L galbana compared with a starved
   control (no food) and (ii) a typical detoxification pattern, i.e. a
   rapid drop in toxin content within the first days followed by a
   secondary slower decrease. GYM levels could be reduced approximately to
   less than 5\% within 7-8 days in clams fed I. galbana, according to the
   initial toxin levels of 1400 and 9400 mu g GYM/kg of DG, respectively.
   At the end of the second experiment, DSP mouse bioassay was negative
   when GYM was less than 100 mu g/kg DG. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Effect of modified clay on the transition of paralytic shellfish toxins

Journal = {AQUACULTURE},

Volume = {505},

Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Shellfish aquaculture is an important marine industry that has been
   threatened by harmful algal blooms (HABs) and, in recent years, toxic
   HABs in particular. The modified clay (MC) treatment is the most
   promising method to mitigate HABs and has been frequently applied in the
   field. To determine how the application of MC affects the accumulation,
   transformation, and detoxification of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
   in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians and surrounding sediments, a
   series of experiments over 16 days in a laboratory simulated Alexandrium
   tamarense bloom were conducted. After 3 h of exposure to A. tamarense at
   2070 (+/- 120) cells mL(-1), the toxicity level in the tissues of the
   scallops increased to 105.9 (+/- 16.6) mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1) in the
   control group (group A, with no addition of MC), while the toxicity
   levels in the scallops of groups B and C (0.1 g L-1 and 0.5 g L-1 MC
   added, respectively) remained at relatively low levels. During the 3 h,
   the scallops in group A had incorporated 73.2 mol\% of the toxin
   contained in the initial A. tamarense algal culture, the scallops in
   group B had incorporated 13.5 mol\% of the toxin, and the scallops in
   group C showed almost no elevation in tissue toxin content. Meanwhile,
   56.8 mol\% and 107.1 mol\% of the PSTs contained in the initial algal
   culture were settled in the sediments along with the MC-algal cells
   combination in group B and C, respectively. The results indicated that
   the application of MC can effectively prevent filter-feeding bivalves
   from ingesting toxic algal cells and decrease the accumulation of toxins
   by settling the toxic algal cells in the sediment. It was also indicated
   that the toxins accumulated within the sediments were more rapidly
   detoxified than that in the scallop tissues. Toxins accumulated by the
   scallops persisted in the tissue for approximately 16 days, while in the
   sediments, all of the PSTs contents were below the HPLC detection limits
   4 days after the addition of MC.},

Abstract = {Application of a method for the ``in situ{''} generation of
   9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) to the derivatization of the carboxyl
   function in diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins revealed the
   formation of artifact products. Using liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry, it was determined that these artifacts were due to
   base-catalyzed reactions between the solvent, ethyl acetate, and the
   hydroxyl groups of the analyte to produce O-acetylated ADAM derivatives.
   Using a new formulation, with tetrahydrofuran as solvent, it was
   possible to eliminate these artifact reactions. Various reaction
   parameters have also been re-optimized to ensure quantitative
   derivatizations. An assessment method was developed that was useful not
   only for optimizing reaction parameters, but also for evaluating the
   reagent potency before use on important samples. Finally, application of
   the method to the determination of DSP toxins in plankton and mussel
   tissue was demonstrated. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Title = {Study of solid phase adsorption of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {447-455},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A computationally designed polymer (CDP), based on the functional
   monomer ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP), with a reported
   high specific affinity for the neurotoxic paralytic shellfish poisoning
   (PSP) toxins saxitoxin (STX) and neosaxitoxin (neoSTX) was evaluated
   with a view to it being used in a solid phase adsorption toxin tracking
   (SPATT) system for deployment in the marine environment. In addition, a
   synthetic resin adsorbent (SEPABEADS (R) SP700) which had previously
   shown to adsorb lipophilic shellfish toxins (LSTs) from seawater was
   also assessed. Adsorption and desorption of the PSP toxin analogues on
   and from the CDP polymer and the SP700 resin were investigated. Both
   adsorbents were contained within dialysis membrane bags and deployed in
   PSP toxins-spiked seawater and in cultures of Alexandrium tamarense
   known to be producing PSP toxins. Additionally, some bags holding SP700
   resin were also deployed in a mixture of dinoflagellate cultures
   composed of A. tamarense and Prorocentrum lima, the latter being a
   diarrheic shellfish toxins (DSP) producer.
   The polymer and the resin were extracted and analysed for PSP toxins
   using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, the
   SP700 resin was also analysed for DSP toxins using liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
   The results indicated that both CDP and SP700 are suitable for the
   adsorption of a wide range of PSP toxins for a limited period of time
   (3-7 days). The CDP appears to be more appropriate because it adsorbs
   higher quantities of PSP toxins, however SP700 adsorbing PSP and DSP
   toxins over the same range seems to be more useful. PSP toxins can be
   easily removed from both materials with rinse water or in a toxin-free
   medium. In summary, either CDP or SP700 could be used as an early
   warming system for the monitoring of harmful algal blooms (HAB)
   responsible for PSP poisoning found in European coastal waters. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Microcystins (MC) produced by several cyanobacteria are potent
   hepatotoxins, whereas the toxicokinetics and subsequent detrimental
   effects ofMCare not fully understood in marine bivalves. In this study,
   the accumulation and depuration pattern of MC-Leucine-Arginine (MC-LR)
   along with the antioxidant response were investigated in the gill tissue
   of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and blue mussel Mytilus edulis
   exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 20 mg L-1 MC-LR for 7 days. Time-and
   concentration-dependent accumulation and depuration of MC-LR were
   observed in the gill tissue during the exposure and depuration phases.
   The values for maximum accumulation of MC-LR and malondialdehyde content
   were statistically significant (P < 0.05) at the end of exposure (day 7)
   to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR for both the bivalves, and at the beginning of the
   depuration period when M. edulis and C. gigas were exposed to 10 and 20
   mg L-1, respectively. A significant level of glutathione (GSH) was
   detected in M. edulis in response to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR during the exposure
   and depuration periods, whereas no significant levels of GSH were
   detected in C. gigas. The MC-LR accumulation induced oxidative stress in
   the gill tissue through modulation of the activities of antioxidant
   enzymes, the antioxidant response being more significant in the mussel
   than in the oyster. The enzymatic activities of glutathione
   S-transferase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and
   glutathione reductase (GR) increased significantly in M. edulis, whereas
   in C. gigas, significant increase in the activities of SOD, catalase,
   and GR were observed at the end of exposure (day 7) to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR.
   Similarly, during the depuration period, significant increases in the
   antioxidant activities were observed in M. edulis mostly at the
   beginning (day 1 and day 5) of exposure compared with the levels in C.
   gigas. The results obtained in this study will be useful in the
   understanding of MC-LR accumulation in bivalve gill tissues and the
   subsequent antioxidant defense response.},

   Molluscan Species: Application to Selection of Sentinel Species in
   Monitoring Programs},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Shellfish toxin monitoring programs often use mussels as the sentinel
   species to represent risk in other bivalve shellfish species. Studies
   have examined accumulation and depuration rates in various species, but
   little information is available to compare multiple species from the
   same harvest area. A 2-year research project was performed to validate
   the use of mussels as the sentinel species to represent other relevant
   eastern Canadian shellfish species (clams, scallops, and oysters).
   Samples were collected simultaneously from Deadmans Harbour, NB, and
   were tested for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and amnesic shellfish
   toxin (AST). Phytoplankton was also monitored at this site. Scallops
   accumulated PSTs and AST sooner, at higher concentrations, and retained
   toxins longer than mussels. Data from monitoring program samples in
   Mahone Bay, NS, are presented as a real-world validation of findings.
   Simultaneous sampling of mussels and scallops showed significant
   differences between shellfish toxin results in these species. These data
   suggest more consideration should be given to situations where multiple
   species are present, especially scallops.},

Year = {1998},

Abstract = {The effect of the saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   lusitanicum on the reproductive success of the calanoid copepod Acartia
   clausi was examined in the laboratory. Experiments were carried out to
   investigate the functional response of feeding and fecundity of copepod
   females at increasing concentrations (200 to 1600 mu g C l(-1)) of
   either the toxic A. lusitanicum or the nontoxic Rhodomonas baltica as
   food sources. Additional experiments were performed to determine if
   prolonged exposure to A. lusitanicum affects copepod survival and
   fecundity. Results demonstrate that A. clausi fed on toxic cells at high
   rates without lethal effects and was able to produce eggs. Survival of
   females was similar with both diets. Depending on the food source,
   different functional responses were found. Feeding and fecundity of A.
   clausi on a diet of R. baltica followed simultaneously a typical
   satiation response. Fecundity was high and attained maximal rates of 32
   to 36 eggs female(-1) d(-1). In contrast, functional responses of
   ingestion and fecundity by A. clausi fed on A. lusitanicum were not
   closely associated. Whereas feeding rates increased linearily with
   increasing food concentrations, egg production was limited and stayed
   constant at 16 to 20 eggs female(-1) d(-1) over the range of food
   concentrations offered. The comparison of calculated gross growth
   efficiencies for females feeding on both algae indicated an inefficient
   utilization of ingested toxic food. High feeding rates on toxic A.
   lusitanicum suggest that saxitoxins do not act as allelopathic chemicals
   against grazing in A. clausi. Nevertheless, fecundity was adversely
   affected. It is suggested that ingested toxins probably interfere with
   digestive processes or cause an enhanced energy expenditure due to
   detoxification because copepods could cope with toxic algae. As a
   result, less energy is available and this might explain the reduced
   fecundity in females.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a highly water-soluble cytotoxin produced by
   several species of freshwater cyanobacteria and it is considered the
   second most studied cyanotoxin worldwide. CYN acts as a potent protein
   and glutathione synthesis inhibitor, as well as inducing genotoxicity,
   oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. Studies concerning
   the depuration of cyanobacterial toxins in aquatic organisms, especially
   in fish, are of great interest for fish economy and public health, but
   are scarce in the case of CYN. This is the first study reporting the
   ability of depuration (3-7 days) in reversing or ameliorating the
   histopathological lesions induced in liver, kidney, heart, intestines,
   and gills of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) due to exposure by
   immersion to repeated doses of a CYN-containing culture of A.
   ovalisporum for 14 days. The main histopathological changes induced by
   CYN were glucogenic degeneration and loss of the normal hepatic
   cord-structure (liver), hyperemia, dilated Bowman's capsule and cellular
   tumefaction (kidney), myofibrolysis, hemorrhages and edema (heart),
   necrosis and partial loss of microvilli (gastrointestinal tract), and
   hyperemia and inflammatory cells infiltrates (gills). After 3 days of
   depuration, gills were totally recovered, while the liver, kidney, and
   gastrointestinal tract required 7 days, and longer depuration periods
   may be needed for a full recovery of the heart. In addition, the
   morphometric study indicated that depuration managed to reverse the
   affectation in the hepatocytes nuclear diameters and cross sections of
   the proximal and distal convoluted tubules induced in CYN-exposed fish.
   In general, these results validate depuration as an effective practice
   for detoxification of fish contaminated with CYN. (c) 2016 Wiley

Note = {Symposium on PharmEcology - A Pharmacological Approach to Understanding
   Plant-Herbivore Interactions, Boston, MA, JAN 03-07, 2009},
Abstract = {Within our lakes, streams, estuaries, and oceans, there is an astounding
   chemodiversity of secondary metabolites produced by microbes, algae, and
   invertebrates. Nearly 30 years of study have yielded hundreds of
   examples in which secondary metabolites alter the foraging behavior or
   fitness of aquatic consumers, or both. However, our understanding of the
   mechanisms that mediate the fate and consequences of these metabolites
   in aquatic consumers remains in its infancy. Interactions between
   metabolites and consumers at the molecular and biochemical level are the
   purview of modern pharmacology, which is rooted in the long history of
   human-drug interactions and can be adopted for ecological studies. Here,
   we argue that a pharmacological approach to consumer-prey interactions
   will be as productive within aquatic systems as it has been for
   understanding terrestrial systems. We review the diversity of secondary
   metabolites in aquatic organisms, their known effects on the feeding
   behaviors and performance of aquatic consumers, and the few studies that
   have attempted to describe their biochemical manipulation within
   consumer tissues, i.e., their absorption, distribution, metabolism
   (including detoxification), and excretion. We then highlight vexing
   issues in the ecology and evolution of aquatic consumer-prey
   interactions that would benefit from a pharmacological approach,
   including specialist-versus-generalist feeding strategies, dietary
   mixing, nutrient-toxin interactions, and taste. Finally, we argue that a
   pharmacological approach could help to predict how consumer-prey
   interactions are altered by global changes in pH, water temperature and
   ultraviolet radiation, or by pollution. Arguably, the state of knowledge
   of aquatic consumer-prey interactions is equivalent to that faced by
   ecologists studying terrestrial herbivores in the 1970s; the literature
   documents profound variation among consumers in their feeding tolerances
   for secondary metabolites without a thorough understanding of the
   mechanisms that underlie that variation. The subsequent advancement in
   our understanding of terrestrial herbivores in the intervening decades
   provides confidence that applying a pharmacological approach to aquatic
   consumers will prove equally productive.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of the most harmful
   neurotoxins distributed worldwide. Marine organism samples, including
   mollusks, crustaceans and fish, collected from 11 sites around the
   coastal water of the South China Sea, were analyzed in terms of the PST
   and toxicity via high-performance liquid chromatography. The PST
   geographical distribution, detectable rate for PST and toxin content all
   increased slightly from 2006 to 2008 to 2015. High PST content with more
   than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in Shantou (ST), Shanwei (SW), Zhanjiang
   (ZJ), Beihai (BH), Xuwen (XW), Haikou (HK), Dongfang (DF), Wanning (WN)
   and Sanya (SY). Low PST content with less than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in
   Shenzhen (SZ) and Yangjiang (YJ). High PST toxicity over the safety
   limit 800 mu g STXeq/kg appeared in ST, SW, ZJ, BH, DF, SY and XW. PST
   has significant seasonal characteristics and was mostly detected in
   spring, early summer (March-June) and autumn (September-November) in the
   coastal water of the South China Sea. PST was usually detected in some
   specific species of scallop, mussel, bloody clam, hard clam, razor clam,
   oyster, crab, shrimp and fish. Toxin profile variation of marine
   organism samples was influenced greatly by species, sampling time and
   site.},

Abstract = {Background: Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) poses a serious threat to
   both public health and the use of aquatic resources from the various
   warm-water regions of the world. Hence, a process for the efficient
   determination of the relevant toxins is required.
   Objective: We sought to develop and validate the first LC-MS/MS method
   to quantify the major toxins prevalent in fish from the Pacific Ocean.
   Method: Toxins were extracted from fish flesh (2g) using a
   methanol-water mixture (9:1, v/v). The extract was heated at 80 degrees
   C, and low-polarity lipids were eliminated using hexane, initially from
   the basic solution and later from the acidic solution. The cleanup was
   performed using solid-phase extraction, Florisil, silica, reversed-phase
   C18, and primary secondary amine columns. A validation study was
   conducted by spiking fish flesh with two representative toxins having
   different skeletal structures and polarities and was calibrated by NMR
   (qNMR) spectroscopy.
   Results: The validation parameters for the ciguatera toxins CTX1B and
   CTX3C at spiked levels of 0.1 mu g/kg were as follows: repeatabilities
   of 2.3-3.5\% and 3.2-5.3\%; intermediate precisions of 6.3-9.8\% and
   6.0-7.4\%; recoveries of 80-107\% and 95-120\%, respectively. The lowest
   detection levels were 0.004 mu g/kg for CTX1B, 0.005 mu g/kg for
   51-hydroxyCTX3C, and 0.009 mu g/kg for CTX3C.
   Conclusions: The described method practically clears the international
   action level of 0.01 mu g/kg CTX1B equivalents set by the U.S. Food and
   Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority and satisfies
   the global standards set by Codex and AOAC INTERNATIONAL.
   Highlights: A validation study for an LC-MS/MS method for ciguatoxin
   detection was completed for the first time using calibrated toxin
   standards.},

Title = {Paralytic shellfish toxin uptake, tissue distribution, and depuration in
   the Southern Rock Lobster Jasus edwardsii Hutton},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Up to 13.6 mg STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1) of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST)
   have been found in the hepatopancreas of Southern Rock Lobster, Jasus
   edwardsii, on the east coast of Tasmania. Blooms of the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella have been reported in this region
   since 2012. Experimental work was undertaken to improve the
   understanding of the uptake and depuration mechanisms involved. Adult
   male lobsters were fed highly toxic mussels (6 mg STX.2HCl equiv.
   kg(-1)) sourced from the impacted area. The apparent feed intake of the
   lobster was positively correlated to increasing PST levels in the
   hepatopancreas. Toxins accumulated rapidly in the hepatopancreas
   reaching a maximum of 9.0 mg STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1), then depurated at a
   rate of 7\% per day once toxic fed was removed. However, PST were not
   detected at significant levels in the haemolymph of these animals.
   Notable increases occurred in the relative amount of several PST
   analogues in the hepatopancreas, including GTX2\&3, C1\&2 and several
   decarbomoyl toxins in comparison to the profile observed in contaminated
   mussel feed. The concentration of PST in lobster antennal glands was two
   orders of magnitude lower than concentrations found in the
   hepatopancreas. This is the first report of PST in lobster antennal
   glands which, along with the gills, represent possible excretion routes
   for PST. Implications for biotoxin risk monitoring are: lobsters will
   continue to feed during bloom periods and high concentrations of PST can
   occur; animal collection should be frequent at the start of a bloom in
   case of a rapid accumulation of PST; and non-lethal sampling is not
   possible as haemolymph PST levels do not reflect what is in the
   hepatopancreas.},

Title = {An integrative response by Mytilus chilensis to the toxic dinoflagellate

Abstract = {Physiological responses of Mytilus chilensis exposed to the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella were measured over 21 days in the
   laboratory and were compared with control mussels not exposed to the
   dinoflagellate. Mussels were collected from culturing ropes at Yaldad
   Bay, southern Chile (43A(0)08'S 73A(0)44'W), in August 2004 and
   acclimated to laboratory conditions for one week prior to the
   experiment. After 8 days, the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins
   (i.e. saxitoxin) in the tissues of exposed mussels exceeded safe levels
   for human consumption. Clearance rates, ingestion of organic matter, and
   absorption efficiency of exposed mussels were significantly lower than
   those of controls on day 0, but this was followed by an increase on day
   3. The exposed mussels also increased their excretion rate over time,
   and this increase was significantly correlated with the accumulation of
   PSP toxins in their tissues. Oxygen consumption was not affected by the
   PSP toxins. The scope for growth (SFG) on day 0 was negative in exposed
   mussels, but it increased during the experiment. Although feeding
   activity and absorption efficiency were adversely affected during the
   first few days of exposure to PSP toxins from A. catenella in the
   laboratory, the M. chilensis cultured in Yaldad Bay may have evolved
   mechanisms that allow them to exploit the toxic dinoflagellate as a food
   source.},

Abstract = {The time course of several outbreaks of the diarrhetic shellfish
   poisoning (DSP) producer Dinophysis actuminata and the consequent
   kinetic of accumulation and loss of toxins in mussels Mytilus
   gailoprovincialis feeding on them was studied. Samples of mussels and
   seawater were frequently (2-3 times a week) collected from a raft in the
   Ria de Vigo. DSP toxins content of mussels and water was analyzed by
   HPLC-FD and phytoplankton was quantified in an inverted light
   microscope. Only okadaic acid (OA) and some of its conjugated forms (OA
   CF), estimated by enzymatic hydrolysis, were found in the plankton
   samples obtained, comprised mainly of D. acuminata cells. The main
   accumulated form in mussels was OA reaching a maximum of 10.1 mug OA
   g(-1) in the digestive gland (d.g.) in 16 days, falling below the
   quarantine level (ca. 2 mug OA g(-1) d.g.) by 45 days. The low polarity
   conjugated forms (LPCF), estimated by hexane extraction, accounted for
   6.2\% of the total toxin burden of the mussels. To quantify the rates of
   the processes involved in the accumulation, transformation and loss of
   the toxins, two dynamic models, a one-compartment and a two-compartment,
   including OA and its conjugated forms as variables were designed and
   implemented. The one-compartment model provided a good fit to the OA and
   LPCF actual data (r(2) = 0.92 and r(2) = 0.94, respectively). The
   two-compartment model did not fit the data markedly better than its
   one-compartment counterpart (r(2) = 0.93 and r(2) = 0.95, for OA and
   LPCF, respectively). High hydrolysis rates were estimated for most of
   the OA CF, which means that these forms came largely from the ingested
   plankton. The low estimated acylation rates support the previous point
   and suggest that the formation of LPCF by direct acylation of the OA is
   of little importance in M. galloprovincialis. Only in cases where the
   intoxication period is very long, can the formed acyl-derivatives be
   important, because they seem to accumulate for a long time in the
   mussels, as suggested by the low hydrolysis and depuration rates
   estimated from model fitting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Cation-Exchange Resin Applied to Paralytic Shellfish Toxins Depuration
   from Bivalves Exposed to Gymnodinium catenatum},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The accumulation of marine biotoxins in shellfish and their consumption
   causes serious food safety problems, threatening human health and
   compromising the availability of protein-based food. It is thus urgent
   to develop methodologies for the detoxification of live bivalves,
   avoiding their economic and nutritional devaluation. In this context, we
   tested an adsorption mechanism of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) based
   on a cation-exchange resin. The first studies using cultures of
   Gymnodinium catenatum (natural producers of PST) showed a decrease of
   about 80\% in overall toxicity after 48 h. Interestingly, we found that
   the toxins are adsorbed differently, with toxins' structural features
   playing a part in the adsorption capacity via steric hindrance,
   electronic effects, or the extent of positive charge density (e.g.,
   dcSTX). The positive effect of the resin in accelerating PST clearance
   from live mussels (Mytilus edulis) is not evident when compared to
   resin-free clearance; nevertheless, relevant information could be
   gathered that will facilitate further in vivo studies. Several factors
   appear to be at play, namely the competition of natural substances
   (e.g., salts, organic matter) for the same binding sites, the blocking
   of pores due to interactions between molecules, and/or difficulties in
   resin absorption by mussels. Additionally, the present work revealed the
   ability of mussels to neutralize pH and proposes bioconversion reactions
   among the PST molecules.},

Title = {Lipase-mediated production of defensive toxins in the marine mollusc
   Oxynoe olivacea},
Journal = {ORGANIC \& BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {2},
Number = {21},
Pages = {3167-3171},
Abstract = {Metabolites related to caulerpenyne (1), a toxic sesquiterpene featured
   by two enol-acetate residues, play a major role in the chemical defence
   of both algae of the genus Caulerpa and a few molluscs of the order
   Sacoglossa. Here we report the direct evidence that cell-free
   preparations of Oxynoe olivacea, a Mediterranean sacoglossan, transform
   efficiently the algal metabolite 1 to oxytoxin-2 (3), the main defensive
   metabolite of the mollusc. The process implies two distinct hydrolytic
   activities, here named LIP-1 and LIP-2, able to operate either
   hydrolysis of the acetyl residue at C-1 or concerted elimination of the
   acetyl groups at C-4 and C-13. Incubation experiments with tissue
   homogenates of O. olivacea or with commercially available lipases
   suggest a two-step mechanism that involves, in vitro, an unstable
   metabolite characterized as preoxytoxin-2 (4). The course of the entire
   process can be easily monitored by reverse phase HPLC/ESI-MS, as well as
   by NMR measurements, which provides direct evidence of the enzymatic
   mechanism leading to the formation of this last compound (4). In
   agreement with the literature, both fresh and frozen tissues of
   Mediterranean Caulerpa prolifera also have the capability to transform 1
   into aldehydic derivatives, namely oxytoxin-1 (2) and oxytoxin-2 (3),
   through hydrolysis of the acetyl groups. However, differently from
   experiments with mollusc homogenates, the conversion is not complete and
   caulerpenyne (1) can be detected in the algal suspension for a few
   hours. HPLC/ESI-MS monitoring of this transformation suggests that the
   hydrolytic route involves different activities in the mollusc and
   seaweed.},

Abstract = {As a part of our studies on the mechanism of uptake of paralytic
   shellfish poison (PSP) and the kinetics of its accumulation in bivalves,
   oysters Crassostrea gigas were experimentally contaminated with PSP by
   being fed with the toxic dinoflagellate A lexandrium tamarense for 2, 4,
   6, 8 and 10 days. Temporal variations in the PSP contents and their
   profiles in oysters during the feeding experiment were monitored by
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the toxin profile of
   the oysters was compared with that of A. tamarense. Toxins excreted from
   the infested oysters into the seawater for 2 and 10 days were recovered
   and analyzed by HPLC. PSP toxicity rapidly appeared in the tissues of
   oysters and their toxicity levels reached 0.6 (0.3), 2.2 (1.1), 1.0
   (0.5), 3.4 (1.6) and 1.1 (0.5) MU/g (nmol/g) shucked meat at 2, 4, 6, 8
   and 10 days, respectively. The accumulation rates of toxin, calculated
   from the total amount (nmol) of toxins expressed by the total cell
   number fed during the exposure period and the toxicity of the oysters,
   were 14.1, 18.7, 5.1, 14.9 and 3.2\% for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days. During
   feeding experiments, the toxin profile of oysters changed substantially,
   showing marked differences from the proportions found in the toxigenic
   dinoflagellate used as food. The toxin components in this strain existed
   almost exclusively as beta-epimers, which accounted for 66.3 mol\% of
   the total. This contrasts with the case of the oysters, where the
   beta-epimers represented 24.8, 29.8, 25.1, 27.3 and 25.2 mol\% of the
   total at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days, respectively. The amount of
   gonyautoxin-1 (GTX1) accumulated in oysters increased linearly and
   slowly for 8 days and the maximum content of GTX1 reached 51.3 mol\%.
   The composition of GTX group compounds recovered from the seawater in
   which the oysters had been reared was a little different from that
   within the oyster tissues.},

Title = {Uptake of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins by Blacklip Abalone (Haliotis
   rubra rubra Leach) from direct exposure to Alexandrium
   catenella microalgal cells and toxic aquaculture feed},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Tasmanian abalone fishery represents the largest wild abalone
   resource in the world, supplying close to 25\% of the annual wild-caught
   global harvest. Prompted by the need to manage Paralytic Shellfish Toxin
   (PST) contamination of Blacklip Abalone (Haliotis rubra rubra) from east
   coast Tasmania, the uptake of toxins by this species is investigated in
   a land-based, controlled aquaculture setting. Abalone were exposed to
   either live Alexandrium catenella microalgal cultures or PST
   contaminated feed pellets during a 28 day exposure period and toxins
   quantified in viscera, foot muscle and epipodium tissues. PST profiles
   of abalone foot tissues were dominated by saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin,
   whilst viscera more closely resembled those of the toxin source (A.
   catenella cells rich in gonyautoxin 1\&4 and 2\&3 or feed pellets
   containing A. catenella extracts rich in these analogues). This
   indicates direct uptake of PST in the viscera via browsing/grazing on
   the pellet and /or sedi-mented microalgal cells. After exposure to A.
   catenella cell culture, PST concentrations in the foot (muscle +
   epipodium) were on average 8 times higher than in the viscera. Higher
   toxicity of foot tissue was caused by higher PST content of the
   epipodium (up to 1,085 mu g STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1)), which despite its
   small contribution to total animal weight significantly added to the
   overall toxin burden. Higher PST levels in the abalone foot suggest that
   toxin monitoring programmes may not need to routinely analyse both foot
   and viscera, potentially allowing for a 50\% reduction of analytical
   costs. This option is being further investigated with continuing field
   studies.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated forty cyanobacterial isolates from
   biofilms, gastropods, brackish water and symbiotic lichen habitats.
   Their aqueous and organic extracts were used to screen for
   apoptosis-inducing activity against acute myeloid leukemia cells. A
   total of 28 extracts showed cytotoxicity against rat acute myeloid
   leukemia (IPC-81) cells. The design of the screen made it possible to
   eliminate known toxins, such as microcystins and nodularin, or known
   metabolites with anti-leukemic activity, such as adenosine and its
   analogs. A cytotoxicity test on human embryonic kidney (HEK293T)
   fibroblasts indicated that 21 of the 28 extracts containing anti-acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) activity showed selectivity in favor of leukemia
   cells. Extracts L26-O and L30-O were able to partly overcome the
   chemotherapy resistance induced by the oncogenic protein Bcl-2, whereas
   extract L1-O overcame protection from the deletion of the tumor
   suppressor protein p53. In conclusion, cyanobacteria are a prolific
   resource for anti-leukemia compounds that have potential for
   pharmaceutical applications. Based on the variety of cellular responses,
   we also conclude that the different anti-leukemic compounds in the
   cyanobacterial extracts target different elements of the death machinery
   of mammalian cells.},

Abstract = {Potential toxic filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii was
   detected to be dominated in one of the retention ponds located in
   Palembang city. It showed persistent domination in the location during
   observations. This species is known to produce a toxin that potentially
   causes environmental health problems. Hepatotoxin, microcystin (the
   cyanotoxin most commonly detected in the freshwater environment) are
   known types of toxin that is produced by this species. Its potential
   produced a toxin that is in concern. A preliminary study was conducted
   to study its potential toxic effect to fish (Cyprinus carpio L.); in
   this study, four different concentrations of Planktothrix agardhii
   biomass were used to study its effects to Cyprinus carpio L. gills. The
   results showed the higher the biomass concentrations (5,4086 x 10(7)
   cells/ml), the shorter the length of time for the fishes to be dead (+/-
   2-2 hours 15 minutes). The fishes also showed swimming behavior changes
   such as swimming direction and excessive mucus excretion.
   Histopathological changes of the fishes' gills that exposed to
   Planktothrix agardhii., compared to the un-treated fishes (control) were
   observed such as edema, lamela gill hyperplasia, and necrosis.},

Title = {Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST)-Transforming Enzymes: A Review},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of toxins that cause
   paralytic shellfish poisoning through blockage of voltage-gated sodium
   channels. PSTs are produced by prokaryotic freshwater cyanobacteria and
   eukaryotic marine dinoflagellates. Proliferation of toxic algae species
   can lead to harmful algal blooms, during which seafood accumulate high
   levels of PSTs, posing a health threat to consumers. The existence of
   PST-transforming enzymes was first remarked due to the divergence of PST
   profiles and concentrations between contaminated bivalves and toxigenic
   organisms. Later, several enzymes involved in PST transformation,
   synthesis and elimination have been identified. The knowledge of
   PST-transforming enzymes is necessary for understanding the processes of
   toxin accumulation and depuration in mollusk bivalves. Furthermore,
   PST-transforming enzymes facilitate the obtainment of pure analogues of
   toxins as in natural sources they are present in a mixture. Pure
   compounds are of interest for the development of drug candidates and as
   analytical reference materials. PST-transforming enzymes can also be
   employed for the development of analytical tools for toxin detection.
   This review summarizes the PST-transforming enzymes identified so far in
   living organisms from bacteria to humans, with special emphasis on
   bivalves, cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, and discusses enzymes'
   biological functions and potential practical applications.},

Title = {Zootoxins and Domestic Animals: A European View},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Zootoxins are produced by venomous and poisonous species and are an
   important cause of poisoning in companion animals and livestock in
   Europe. Little information about the incidence of zootoxin poisoning is
   available in Europe, with only a few case reports and review papers
   being published. This review presents the most important zootoxins
   produced by European venomous and poisonous animal species responsible
   for poisoning episodes in companion animals and livestock. The main
   zootoxin-producing animal species, components of the toxins/venoms and
   their clinical effects are presented. The most common zootoxicoses
   involve terrestrial zootoxins excreted by the common toad, the fire
   salamander, the pine processionary caterpillar, and vipers. The lack of
   a centralized reporting/poison control system in Europe makes the
   evaluation of the epidemiology of zootoxin-induced poisonings extremely
   difficult. Even if there are many anecdotal reports in the veterinary
   community about the exposure of domestic animals to terrestrial and
   marine zootoxins, the number of published papers regarding these
   toxicoses is low. Climate change and its consequences regarding species
   distribution and human-mediated transportation are responsible for the
   emerging nature of some intoxications in which zootoxins are involved.
   Although new venomous or poisonous animal species have emerged in
   regions where they were previously unreported, zootoxins produced by
   native species remain the main concern in Europe. The diversity of
   poisonous and venomous animal species and the emerging nature of certain
   poisonings warrant the continuous update to such knowledge by veterinary
   professionals and animal owners. This review offers an overview about
   zootoxin-related poisonings in domestic animals in Europe and also
   provides important information from a health perspective.},

Title = {Modelling paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) accumulation in
   Crassostrea gigas by using Dynamic Energy Budgets (DEB)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {143},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {152-164},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As other filter-feeders, Crassostrea gigas can concentrate paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST) by consuming dino-flagellate phytoplankton
   species like Alexandrium minutum. Intake of PST in oyster tissues mainly
   results from feeding processes, i.e. clearance rate, pre-ingestive
   sorting and ingestion that are directly influenced by environmental
   conditions (trophic sources, temperature). This study aimed to develop a
   mechanistic model coupling the kinetics of PST accumulation and
   bioenergetics in C. gigas based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory.
   For the first time, the Synthesizing Units (SU) concept was applied to
   formalize the feeding preference of oysters between non-toxic and toxic
   microalgae. Toxin intake and accumulation were both dependent on the
   physiological status of oysters. The accumulation was modelled through
   the dynamics of two toxin compartments: (1) a compartment of ingested
   but non-assimilated toxins, with labile toxins within the digestive
   gland eliminated via faeces production; (2) a compartment of assimilated
   toxins with a rapid detoxification rate (within a few days). Firstly,
   the DEB-PST model was calibrated using data from two laboratory
   experiments where oysters have been exposed to A. minutum. Secondly, it
   was validated using data from another laboratory experiment and from
   three field surveys carried out in the Bay of Brest (France) from 2012
   to 2014. To account for the variability in PST content of A. minutum
   cells, the saxitoxin (STX) amount per energy units in a toxic algae
   (ppsT) was adjusted for each dataset. Additionally, the effects of PST
   on the oyster bioenergetics were calibrated during the first laboratory
   experiment. However, these effects were shown to depend on the strain of
   A. minutum. Results of this study could be of great importance for
   monitoring agencies and decision makers to identify risky conditions
   (e.g. production areas, seawater temperature), to properly assess
   detoxification step (e.g. duration, modalities) before any
   commercialization or to improve predictions regarding closing of
   shellfish areas.},

Title = {The effect of size and age on depuration rates of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins (DST) in mussels (Mytilus edulis L.)},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {288-300},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Deputation or elimination of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DST) was
   followed for 73 days in 1 - and 2-year-old mussels. The age groups also
   differed in size, providing a broad approach to studying the effect of
   the differences in physiology accompanying the differences in size.
   Content of DST was analysed both on groups and individual mussels.
   Environmental variables were measured to evaluate their effect on
   depuration.
   We found no significant differences in elimination rate of DST between
   1- and 2-year-old mussels under natural conditions. This suggests that
   size and age do not affect the elimination rate of the DST. The present
   study is the first study on the effect of age and size on the
   elimination rate of algal toxins in bivalves. The natural variations in
   food levels and temperature were not found to affect the elimination
   rate of DST. The digestive gland weights in the 1-year-old mussels
   increased four times while the DST content per individual decreased
   eight times.
   This demonstrated that dilution of toxins due to tissue growth could
   have an important contribution to declines in toxin concentrations.
   Changes in tissue mass are affected by environmental variables via
   growth or starvation, and when such changes lead to concentration or
   dilution of toxins this does not reflect the accumulation or removal of
   toxins from the tissues. We hence suggest that when evaluating the
   actual elimination capacity of the mussels, as in the present study, the
   total content of toxins per individual should be used, rather than toxin
   concentrations.
   The 1-year-old mussels had faster growth compared to the 2-year-old
   mussels in both total soft tissue and digestive glands. The mechanism of
   DST elimination is still unknown. If this process involves metabolism of
   the toxins, one could expect the rates of elimination to follow overall
   metabolic rates. However, the results from the present study suggest
   that large differences in growth rates, which also include difference in
   feeding and metabolic rates, do not affect the elimination rate of DST.
   Our results support the assumption that the deputation rates cannot be
   accelerated, even in artificial systems, as a cost-effective way to
   solve the problem with toxic mussels for the industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Pages = {1-7},

Abstract = {Economic bivalve ingested toxic algae causes frequent human poisoning
   events. To explore new compounds that can accelerate the depuration of
   toxins in shellfish, we investigated the detoxification of the paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) and the biotransformation pathway of PSTs during
   detoxification by the application of three treatments to a toxic bloom,
   Alexandrium minutum (A. minutum). The detoxification effect of
   Platymonas sub-cordiformis (PS) mixed with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)
   group is significantly better than the starving group in each oyster
   tissues. The toxicity of viscera which occupied 78.95\% of total
   toxicity reduced to 155 MU/100g after 13 days' depuration experiment.
   And adding CMC could significantly achieve rapid detoxification and
   effectively reduce the STX to 0.07 mu mol/100 g in viscera. Meanwhile,
   PSTs underwent biotransformation during the depuration process, which
   mainly manifested as GTX1/4 -> GTX2/3 -> STX, GTX2 -> dcGTX2. This study
   explored a new strategy for toxin depuration in shellfish.},

Abstract = {Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of marine algal toxins. In this study,
   the accumulation and depuration of pectenotoxins in brown crab Cancer
   pagurus were investigated. Crabs were fed with toxic blue mussels
   Mytilus edulis for 21 days and then depurated for 42 days. Toxins were
   extracted with methanol from the digestive glands of contaminated crabs,
   uncontaminated crabs (control group) and from blue mussels for
   comparison. Extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatograph coupled with
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The concentrations of PTX-2, PTX-2
   SA, 7-epi-PTX-2 SA, and PTX-12 were analyzed in two batches of toxic
   blue mussels and the crabs. A one-compartment model was applied to
   describe the depuration of PTXs. The half-life of PTXs was estimated to
   be 6-7.5 days. After depuration for 42 days, the amount of PTXs measured
   in the crab digestive glands was less than 1 mu g/kg.},

Title = {Exposure to toxic Alexandrium minutum activates the

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms of Alexandrium spp. dinoflagellates regularly occur
   in French coastal waters contaminating shellfish. Studies have
   demonstrated that toxic Alexandrium spp. disrupt behavioural and
   physiological processes in marine filter-feeders, but molecular
   modifications triggered by phycotoxins are less well understood. This
   study analyzed the mRNA levels of 7 genes encoding
   antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes in gills of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea
   gigas) exposed to a cultured, toxic strain of A. minutum, a producer of
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) or fed Tisochrysis lutea (T. lutea,
   formerly Isochrysis sp., clone Tahitian (T. iso)), a non-toxic control
   diet, in four repeated experiments. Transcript levels of sigma-class
   glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR) and ferritin
   (Fer) were significantly higher in oysters exposed to A. minutum
   compared to oysters fed T. lutea. The detoxification pathway based upon
   glutathione (GSH)-conjugation of toxic compounds (phase II) is likely
   activated, and catalyzed by GST. This system appeared to be activated in
   gills probably for the detoxification of PST and/or extra-cellular
   compounds, produced by A. minutum. GST, GR and Fer can also contribute
   to antioxidant functions to prevent cellular damage from increased
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) originating either from A. minutum cells
   directly, from oyster hemocytes during immune response, or from other
   gill cells as by-products of detoxification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Transcriptional Responses of Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase Genes in
   Scallops Exposed to PST-Producing Dinoflagellates Implying Their
   Involvements in Detoxification},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) is one of the most prominent
   xenobiotic metabolic enzymes. It can catalyze the conversion of
   heteroatom-containing chemicals to polar, readily excretable metabolites
   and is considered an efficient detoxification system for xenobiotics.
   Bivalves can accumulate paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by
   dinoflagellates, especially during outbreaks of harmful algal blooms.
   Exploring FMO genes in bivalves may contribute to a better understanding
   of the adaptation of these species and the mechanisms of PSTs
   bioavailability. Therefore, through genome screening, we examined the
   expansion of FMO genes in two scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis and
   Chlamys farreri) and found a new subfamily (FMO\_like). Our expression
   analyses revealed that, in both scallops, members of the FMO\_N-oxide
   and FMO\_like subfamilies were mainly expressed from the D-stage larvae
   to juveniles, whereas the FMO\_GS-OX subfamily genes were mainly
   expressed at and prior to the trochophore stage. In adult organs, higher
   expressions of FMOs were observed in the kidney and hepatopancreas than
   in other organs. After exposure to PST-producing algae, expression
   changes in FMOs occurred in hepatopancreas and kidney of both scallops,
   with more members being up-regulated in hepatopancreas than in kidney
   for Alexandrium catenella exposure, while more up-regulated FMOs were
   found in kidney than in hepatopancreas of C. farreri exposed to A.
   minutum. Our findings suggest the adaptive functional diversity of
   scallop FMO genes in coping with the toxicity of PST-producing algae.},

   Alexandrium tamarense caused by microplastic particles},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {338},

Abstract = {A variety of studies have investigated the toxic effects of
   microplastics (MPs) on microalgae, but few of them considered their
   influence on dinoflagellate toxins production, which could cause
   significant ecological safety concerns in coastal areas. This research
   investigated the impacts of 5 mu g L-1 and 5 mg L-1 polystyrene (PS) MPs
   on the changes of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) production and their
   relationship with cellular oxidative stress of Alexandrium tamarense, a
   common harmful algal blooms causative dinoflagellate. The results showed
   elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, activation of
   antioxidant system and overproduction of PSTs were positively correlated
   under PS MPs exposure (especially under 5 mg L-1 PS MPs), and the PSTs
   changes were eliminated by the ROS inhibitor. Further transcriptomic
   analysis revealed that ROS could enhance biosynthesis of glutamate,
   providing raw materials for PSTs precursor arginine, accompanied with
   enhanced acetyl-CoA and ATP production, finally leading to the
   overproduction of PSTs. Moreover, the oxidative intracellular
   environments might block the reduction process from STX to C1\&C2,
   leading to the increase of STX and decrease of C1\&C2 proportions. This
   work brings the first evidence that ROS could mediate PSTs production
   and compositions of Alexandrium under MPs exposure, with important
   scientific and ecological significance.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are a major group of potent cyanobacterial toxins
   found in freshwater and even brackish waterbodies. To understand the
   putative correlation between bioconcentration of MCs and antioxidant
   responses of the digestive gland of bivalves, Pacific oyster Crassostrea
   gigas and blue mussel Mytilus edulis were exposed to different
   concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 and 20 mu g L-1) of MC-Leucine-Arginine (LR)
   for seven days. MC-LR bioconcentrated in the digestive glands of both
   bivalves during exposure period. The levels were slightly reduced when
   the bivalves were exposed to seawater during depuration (7 days), while
   approximately 0.1 mu g L-1 of MCLR was observed in the 10 and 20 mu g
   L-1 exposed bivalves at the end of depuration. Intracellular
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly
   elevated in the 10 and 20 mu g L-1 exposed bivalves at 7 day, and the
   levels were maintained during depuration in both bivalves. Overall,
   significant higher levels of enzymatic activities of antioxidant defense
   systems such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT),
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione
   reductase (GR) were observed in the 10 and 20 mu g L-1 exposed bivalves.
   Interestingly, most of higher levels of Pacific oyster were detected at
   exposure period, while blue mussel showed higher levels at depuration
   phase, suggesting a species-specific sensitivity upon MC-LR. These
   patterns were correlated with the bioconcentration patterns of MC-LR as
   Pacific oyster was highly accumulated by MC-LR during exposure period,
   but blue mussel showed prolonged high levels of MC-LR for depuration
   phase. Our results will be useful to understand species-specific
   bioconcentration of MC-LR in bivalves and their effects on intracellular
   oxidative status via accumulation.},

Abstract = {We used gel filtration chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography and
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to purify tributyltin-binding protein
   type 2 (TBT-bp 2) from plasma of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys
   olivaceus) injected intraperitoneally with TBT (5.0 mg/kg body weight).
   Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that
   the molecular mass of TBT-bp 2 was approximately 48 kDa, and isoelectric
   focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the
   isoelectric point was approximately 3.0. TBT-bp 2 contained 40\%
   N-glycan. The complete cDNA nucleotide sequence and the genome sequence
   of TBT-bp 2 were determined by means of rapid amplification of cDNA ends
   of liver tissue of Japanese flounder and a genome-walking technique,
   respectively. The 216 amino acid sequence of TBT-bp 2 showed 47\%
   identity to the sequences of puffer fish (Takifugu pardalis) saxitoxin-
   and tetrodotoxin-binding protein but only 27\% similarity to the
   sequence of TBT-bp 1. Analysis of the motif sequence of the amino acid
   sequence and the structure of the gene encoding TBT-bp 2 suggested that
   this protein belongs to the lipocalin superfamily.},

Abstract = {Feeding and survival experiments with three different toxic strains of
   Alexandrium minutum (AL1V, AL2V, and AMINAR1) revealed that copepods
   Acartia grani and Euterpina acutifrons were able to consume all A.
   minutum strains to a similar extent at which they fed on the non-toxic
   and similar-sized Scrippsiella trochoidea (strain S. T.). Feeding of
   both copepod species showed a typical satiation response to increasing
   food concentrations. Ingestion rates of A. grani on the four
   dinoflagellate strains were always higher than those observed for E.
   acutifrons. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between these
   rates for the most toxic strain (AL1V) when comparing both copepod
   species. For carbon concentrations higher than 800 mu g C copepod(-1)
   h(-1), ingestion rates of both copepod species on AL1V were higher than
   those found for S. T., and such behaviour could probably be linked to
   digestive dysfunction or to the use of part of the accumulated energy in
   detoxification processes. Survival rates and physiological condition
   index data suggest that A. grani is more sensitive to A. minutum PSP
   toxins than E. acutifrons. A long-term exposure experiment (288 h)
   resulted in 0\% survival of A. grani when exposed to AL1V, whereas
   survival of E. acutifrons was greater than 50\% for this strain. For the
   less toxic AMINAR1 strain, the survival rate of E. acutifrons was 80\%
   compared to 95\% survival feeding on S. trochoidea. Our results suggest
   that both A. grani and E. acutifrons can act, to a different extent, as
   A. minutum PSP-toxin vectors through the food web.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) in freshwater and marine waters released by
   toxin-producing cyanobacteria have negative impacts to the aquatic
   environment. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pure
   microcystin-LR on activity and transcript level of immune-related
   enzymes in the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. After exposed to
   varying concentrations of pure microcystin-LR (MC-LR) for 30 days, the
   activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), lysozyme (LZM), glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx), peroxidase (POD), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline
   phosphatase (AKP) and transcript level of cMn-sod, lzm, gpx were
   investigated in the hepatopancreas of white shrimp (L. vannamei).
   Immune-related enzyme activities responded differently to MC-LR
   exposure. SOD, GPx, and POD activity in the hepatopancreas were
   activated in a concentration-dependent manner while LZM activity was
   significantly inhibited in the treatment groups. ACP and AKP activity
   showed an increase, followed by a decrease. The transcript levels of
   cMn-sod, lzm, and gpx were consistent with changes in their encoding
   enzyme activity. These results demonstrated that sub-chronical exposure
   to MC-LR induced the alteration of immune-related enzymes and
   corresponding genes in the hepatopancreas, which may help explain the
   presence of detoxification mechanisms in crustaceans and how they were
   protected from MC-LR stress for a long period of time.},

Title = {Unraveling the Physiological Roles of the Cyanobacterium
   Geitlerinema sp BBD and Other Black Band Disease Community
   Members through Genomic Analysis of a Mixed Culture},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Black band disease (BBD) is a cyanobacterial-dominated polymicrobial mat
   that propagates on and migrates across coral surfaces, necrotizing coral
   tissue. Culture-based laboratory studies have investigated cyanobacteria
   and heterotrophic bacteria isolated from BBD, but the metabolic
   potential of various BBD microbial community members and interactions
   between them remain poorly understood. Here we report genomic insights
   into the physiological and metabolic potential of the BBD-associated
   cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. BBD 1991 and six associated bacteria
   that were also present in the non-axenic culture. The essentially
   complete genome of Geitlerinema sp. BBD 1991 contains a sulfide quinone
   oxidoreductase gene for oxidation of sulfide, suggesting a mechanism for
   tolerating the sulfidic conditions of BBD mats. Although the operon for
   biosynthesis of the cyanotoxin microcystin was surprisingly absent,
   potential relics were identified. Genomic evidence for mixed-acid
   fermentation indicates a strategy for energy metabolism under the
   anaerobic conditions present in BBD during darkness. Fermentation
   products may supply carbon to BBD heterotrophic bacteria. Among the six
   associated bacteria in the culture, two are closely related to organisms
   found in culture-independent studies of diseased corals. Their metabolic
   pathways for carbon and sulfur cycling, energy metabolism, and
   mechanisms for resisting coral defenses suggest adaptations to the coral
   surface environment and biogeochemical roles within the BBD mat.
   Polysulfide reductases were identified in a Flammeovirgaceae genome
   (Bacteroidetes) and the sox pathway for sulfur oxidation was found in
   the genome of a Rhodospirillales bacterium (Alphaproteobacteria),
   revealing mechanisms for sulfur cycling, which influences virulence of
   BBD. Each genomic bin possessed a pathway for conserving energy from
   glycerol degradation, reflecting adaptations to the glycerol-rich coral
   environment. The presence of genes for detoxification of reactive oxygen
   species and resistance to antibiotics suggest mechanisms for combating
   coral defense strategies. This study builds upon previous research on
   BBD and provides new insights into BBD disease etiology.},

Abstract = {Prorocentrum lima, a widely distributed dinoflagellate known for its
   production of harmful biotoxins, poses a significant threat to humans,
   aquaculture, and marine ecosystems. As a result, the detection of this
   toxic alga in coastal waters has become an urgent research focus. In
   this study, a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective detection method
   based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed to
   identify P. lima. In this method, cell extracts of P. lima were diluted
   and used directly as templates for amplification, eliminating the need
   for nucleic acid purification and simplifying the detection process.
   Hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB) was incorporated into the reaction mix to
   facilitate result interpretation, enabling visual determination of the
   amplification outcome with the naked eye. The entire detection process,
   from DNA extraction to template amplification and product detection,
   could be completed within 80 min using a simple constant
   temperature-control device. This LAMP-based detection method
   demonstrated excellent reliability, specificity, and a low detection
   limit of 5.87 cells/mL for DNA crude extract. The assay offered an
   efficient alternative to PCR for rapid detection of P. lima. By
   streamlining the detection process and offering a visual readout, this
   technique holds promise for efficient and routine monitoring of harmful
   algal species, benefitting both research efforts and environmental
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {To study the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) depuration in Japanese
   scallop Patinopecten yessoensis in natural environment, Japanese
   scallops naturally contaminated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins in the Dayao Bay in the northern Huanghai Sea are transited to
   Qipanmo waters in the Bohai Sea of no reported PSTs incidents. The
   levels and profile of PSTs during 30-day depuration are detected by the
   high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection
   (HPLC-FLD). The results show that the toxicity of the PSTs in soft
   tissues decreases to a relatively low level at Day 9. Moreover, the
   depurated ratio at the early stage of the PSTs depuration is higher than
   that at the later stage. The toxicity analysis of dissected organs
   reveals that the digestive gland is the most contaminated PSTs part,
   which is of important implication for the human health and scallop
   aquiculture. The mortality of Japanese scallops during PSTs depuration
   experiment is relevant to PSTs level in the soft tissue.},

Title = {Effects of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum on

Abstract = {Juvenile Pacific giant lions-paw scallops Nodipecten subnodosus were fed
   the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, a producer of paralytic
   shellfish poison (PSP), supplied with Isochrysis galbana (a nontoxic
   microalgae). Short-term (< 24 h) experiments were performed to determine
   clearance and ingestion rates of G. catenatum. Kinetics of PSP was
   examined in longer-term experiments (> 2 days). At high food
   concentrations, juvenile scallops showed production of pseudofeces,
   partial shell valve closure, and reduction in feeding. According to HPLC
   analysis, the only toxins present in the dinoflagellate G. catenatum and
   in the scallops were the gonyautoxins (GTXs), except in the labial palps
   and digestive gland, where trace amounts of saxitoxin (STX) were present
   in scallops. These tissues could play an important role in toxin
   biotransformation. The ranking of toxin concentration in tissues was:
   digestive gland > labial palps > intestine > gills > mantle > adductor
   muscle, where the total contribution of viscera was more than 80\% of
   the total toxin body burden. Juvenile scallops exhibited no apparent
   detrimental physiological responses during the long-term feeding
   experiment. The dinoflagellate may contribute nutrients to the scallop,
   in addition to the microalgae I. galbana. The dinoflagellate may enhance
   cell uptake and byssus production. Once PSP accumulated during the first
   12 days, it was slowly eliminated. The limited capacity for accumulating
   toxins in the adductor muscle favors domestic marketing of scallops.},

Year = {1981},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {41-50},
Abstract = {Under intracellular perfusion with a solution containing K+ as the sole
   cation species, squid giant axons were capable of developing all-or-none
   action potentials when immersed in a medium in which CaCl2 was the only
   electrolyte. The adequate range of ion concentration for demonstrating
   this capability was mentioned. The reversal potential level measured by
   the voltage-clamp technique varied directly with the logarithm of the
   concentration of extracellular Ca-ion; the proportionality constant was
   close to RT/2F {[}R is the gas constant, F the Faraday constant and T
   the absolute temperature.] The action potential observed under this Ca-K
   bi-ionic condition could not be suppressed by addition of tetrodotoxin
   or saxitoxin to the external medium. The external Ca-ion could be
   replaced with Co- or Mn-ion without eliminating the capability of the
   axons to develop action potentials. D-600 could not suppress the inward
   current observed under the voltage-clamp condition, but 4-aminopyridine
   could suppress it. The experimental findings were interpreted based on
   the current channel hypothesis and on the macromolecular theory.},

Year = {2012},

Pages = {7884-7899},
Abstract = {The potent antitumor agent phorboxazole Awas synthesized from six
   subunits comprising C1-C2 (115), C3-C8 (98), C9-C19 (74), C20-C32 (52),
   C33-C41 (84) and C42-C46 (85). Tetrahydropyrans B and C containing
   cis-2,6-disubstitution were fabricated via palladium(II)-mediated
   intramolecular alkoxycarbonylation which, in the case of tetrahydropyran
   C, was carried out with catalytic palladium(II) and p-benzoquinone as
   the stoichiometric re-oxidant. Tetrahydropyran D was obtained by a
   stereoselective tin(IV)-catalyzed coupling of a C9 aldehyde with an
   allylsilane, and the C19-C20 connection was made using a completely
   stereoselective Wittig-Schlosser (E) olefination. Coupling of the
   oxazole C32 methyl substituent with the intact C33-C46 delta-lactone 3
   was accompanied by elimination of the vinyl bromide to a terminal
   alkyne, but the C32-C33 linkage was implemented successfully with 83 and
   C33-C41 lactone 84. The C42-C46 segment of the side chain was then
   appended via Julia-Kocienski olefination. The macrolide portion of
   phorboxazole Awas completed by means of an Ando-Still-Gennari
   intramolecular (Z)-selective olefination at C2-C3 which required
   placement of a (dimethoxyphosphinyl) acetate moiety at C24. Final
   deprotection led to phorboxazole Avia a route in which the longest
   linear sequence is 37 steps and the overall yield is 0.36\%.},

Abstract = {To determine whether toxic metabolites produced by fungi could cause
   shellfish toxicities, mussels were contaminated in laboratory conditions
   by sterile filtrates of a liquid culture of a strain of the fungus
   Trichoderma koningii previously isolated from a shellfish, the cockle
   (Cerastoderma edule). Mussels were kept in aerated natural seawater and
   fed with a culture of the microalga Isochrysis galbana, to which a
   filtrate of liquid fungal culture was added. Mussels were exposed to
   contamination for 7 days at 16 or 20 degrees C and extractions were then
   performed and their activity tested on blowfly larvae. The same toxicity
   was found in the fungal filtrate and the shellfish, indicating
   bioaccumulation. The digestive gland was the most toxic part of the
   mussel, confirming contamination by filtration. Treated mussels produced
   a mucus which appeared to be a means of eliminating toxic metabolites.

Title = {Transcriptomic analysis of chitosan derivatives on detoxification of
   hepatopancreas in bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) infected
   with paralytic shellfish toxin},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {567},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Marine bivalves could accumulate paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
   produced by toxic microalgae. These could impact physiological and
   cellular responses, being transmitted throughout the food chain and
   ultimately endangering human health. In the present study, we prepared
   chitosan derivatives as detoxification materials, performed infection
   and detoxification experiments of PSTs on scallops, and applied
   transcriptomics to elucidate the immune defense and detoxification
   mechanisms of scallops. The results showed that SMC was successfully
   synthesized, and compared with chitosan, the specific surface area
   decreased, the surface roughness increased, and the stacked granular
   structure was obvious. The adsorption rate of PSTs in aqueous solution
   was 54.42\%, and the detoxification effect on the poisoned scallops was
   55.29\%; the detoxification effect on the kidneys was more significant.
   Transcriptomic data of scallops' hepatopancreas showed that the defense
   and detoxification phases induced 1805 and 1692 differential genes,
   respectively. Among them, cytochrome P450 and C1q complementrelated
   genes were significantly differentially expressed in both defense and
   detoxification phases. The differential expression of immune-related
   genes, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), GTPases of the
   immuneassociated protein family (GIMAPs), and Toll-like receptors
   (TLRs), suggests that they may play an important role in the early
   stages of immune defense. Detoxification enzyme genes, such as multidrug
   resistance-associated protein (MRP) and glutathione sulfotransferase
   (GST), play a key role in later stages of detoxification. Here we first
   identified that detoxifying agents (SMC) in scallops can enter the
   hepatopancreas and kidneys, and observed a significant reduction in
   chitin synthase (CHS) expression, which confirmed the good
   detoxification effect of SMC on scallops. These findings help us to
   understand the molecular mechanism of scallop exposure response to PSTs.},

Abstract = {The etiology of black band disease (BBD), a persistent, globally
   distributed coral disease characterized by a dark microbial mat, is
   still unclear. A metatranscriptomics approach was used to unravel the
   roles of the major mat constituents in the disease process. By comparing
   the transcriptomes of the mat constituents with those of the surface
   microbiota of diseased and healthy corals, we showed a shift in
   bacterial composition and function in BBD-affected corals. mRNA reads of
   Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla were prominent in the
   BBD mat. Cyanobacterial adenosylhomocysteinase, involved in cyanotoxin
   production, was the most transcribed gene in the band consortium.
   Pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of Vibrio spp., mainly transcribing
   the thiamine ABC transporter, were abundant and highly active in both
   the band and surface tissues. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was the
   primary producer of sulfide in the band. Members of the Bacilli class
   expressed high levels of rhodanese, an enzyme responsible for cyanide
   and sulfide detoxification. These results offer a first look at the
   varied functions of the microbiota in the disease mat and surrounding
   coral surface and enabled us to develop an improved functional model for
   this disease.},

Abstract = {As filter-feeding animals mainly ingesting microalgae, bivalves could
   accumulate paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by harmful algae
   through diet. To protect themselves from the toxic effects of PSTs,
   especially the concomitant oxidative damage, the production of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is the only eukaryotic metalloenzyme
   capable of detoxifying superoxide, may assist with toxin tolerance in
   bivalves. To better understand this process, in the present study, we
   performed the first systematic analysis of SOD genes in bivalve Chlamys
   farreri, an important aquaculture species in China. A total of six
   Cu/Zn-SODs (SOD1-6) and two Mn-SODs (SOD7, SOD8) were identified in C.
   farreri, with gene expansion being revealed in Cu/Zn-SODs. In scallops
   exposed to two different PSTs-producing dinoflagellates, Alexandrium
   minutum and A. catenella, expression regulation of SOD genes was
   analyzed in the top ranked toxin-rich organs, the hepatopancreas and the
   kidney. In hepatopancreas, which mainly accumulates the incoming PSTs,
   all of the six Cu/Zn-SODs showed significant alterations after A.
   minutum exposure, with SOD1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 being up-regulated, and SOD4
   being down-regulated, while no significant change was detected in
   Mn-SODs. After A. catenella exposure, up-regulation was observed in
   SOD2, 4, 6, and 8, and SOD7 was down-regulated. In the kidney, where
   PSTs transformation occurs, SOD4, 5, 6, and 8 were up-regulated, and
   SOD7 was down-regulated in response to A. minutum feeding. After A.
   catenella exposure, all the Cu/Zn-SODs except SOD1 were up-regulated,
   and SOD7 was down-regulated in kidney. Overall, in scallops after
   ingesting different toxic algae, SOD up-regulation mainly occurred in
   the expanded Cu/Zn-SOD group, and SOD6 was the only member being
   up-regulated in both toxic organs, which also showed the highest fold
   change among all the SODs, implying the importance of SOD6 in protecting
   scallops from the stress of PSTs. Our results suggest the diverse
   function of scallop SODs in response to the PST-producing algae
   challenge, and the expansion of Cu/Zn-SODs might be implicated in the
   adaptive evolution of scallops or bivalves with respect to antioxidant
   defense against the ingested toxic algae.},

Abstract = {We exposed green-lipped mussels Perna viridis and black sea breams
   Acanthopagrus schlegeli to toxic dinoflagellates Alexandrium fundyense
   to evaluate the accumulation, distribution, transformation, and
   elimination of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in a controlled
   environmental condition. The mussels were fed A. fundyense for 7 days
   followed by 3 weeks of deputation, and the fish were fed toxic clams
   (pre-exposed to the dinoflagellates) for 5 days followed by 2 weeks of
   deputation. The toxin content and the compartmental distribution of PSTs
   were monitored throughout the experiments by high-performance liquid
   chromatography with post-column fluorescence derivatization (HPLC-FLD).
   This is the first report to assess the biokinetics of PSTs in marine
   fish under dietary exposure. The hepatopancreas in the mussels and the
   viscera in the fish accumulated most of the PSTs. Differential
   elimination of each toxin was observed in the mussels. The C2 toxins
   were eliminated rapidly in all organs; except in hepatopancreas, the
   more potent toxins such as GTX4, were eliminated slower during the
   deputation period. The relative proportions of various PSTs in the
   mussels changed over time, suggesting toxin-specific uptake and
   elimination rates, or biotransformation preferences between toxins. In
   the fish, the ratio of C1/C2 was 3.0 times (p < 0.01) higher when
   compared to the clam tissues, indicating that conversion from C2 to C1
   might have occurred when the toxin was transferred from the clams to the
   fish. In summary, species differences in uptake, distribution and
   elimination of PSTs were observed between mussels and fish, and this may
   influence trophic transfer of algal toxins in marine organisms. (c) 2006

Abstract = {New C-11 hydroxyl metabolites of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) have
   been reported in shellfish. To gain further information on these
   metabolites, as well as the potential for formation of phase-II
   metabolites and acyl esters of PSTs, bivalves were fed with the
   PSTs-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum (strain ATHK).
   Through independent experiments, scallops (Chlamys farreri) were fed for
   9 days and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) for 5 days plus an
   additional 5 days of depuration, with representative samples taken
   throughout. Several common PSTs (C1-4, GTX1-6 and NEO) and metabolites
   including Ml, M3, M5, M7, M9, M2 and M8 were detected in the
   hepatopancreas of scallops during toxin accumulation and in the
   hepatopancreas of mussels during both toxin accumulation and elimination
   periods. The relative molar ratio of metabolites to precursor molecules
   was used to estimate relative metabolic conversion rates. Conversion
   rates of C1/2 and GTX2/3 were higher than those of C3/4 and GTX1/4, in
   scallops and mussels. The first metabolites observed in both bivalve
   species investigated were M1/3, which are formed from C1/2. However, the
   conversion of GTX2/3 to M2 was more complete than other
   biotransformation reactions in both mussels and scallops. In general,
   metabolic conversion of PSTs was observed after a shorter time and to a
   greater extent in mussels than in scallops in the exposure period. No
   acyl esters or conjugation products of PSTs with glucuronic acid,
   glutathione, cysteine and taurine were detected by liquid chromatography
   with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the samples
   investigated. Additionally, only GTX1/4 and GTX2/3 were detected in the
   kidney of scallops, which demonstrates that PSTs are mainly metabolized
   through the hepatic metabolism pathway in bivalves. This work improves
   the understanding of PST metabolism during toxin accumulation and
   depuration in commercially harvested shellfish.},

Title = {Refinement and implementation of the Lawrence method (AOAC 2005.06) in a

Abstract = {In 2010 the Cawthron Institute adopted AOAC official method 2005.06
   (Lawrence method) for regulatory testing of paralytic shellfish toxins.
   This included adapting the method to a UPLC format and developing a
   rapid periodate screen to eliminate the vast majority of samples with no
   PSTs present. The method gained New Zealand regulatory approval and has
   since been used to test >2000 samples. Soon after implementation a major
   HAB of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella occurred in a
   prime shellfish growing area of New Zealand. This event was the most
   serious to date in this country with extremely high cell concentrations
   observed in some locations (>4 x 10(6) cells L-1). Toxin levels observed
   in Greenshell (TM) mussels (Perna canaliculus) and Flat oysters (Ostrea
   chilensis) exceeded the regulatory level of 0.8 mg/kg shellfish meat as
   saxitoxin equivalents. Closures of commercial shellfish harvesting areas
   were enforced for a period of up to three months as toxin levels
   remained above the regulatory level for an extended period, even after
   the bloom had crashed.
   Analysis of several hundred positive shellfish samples during this event
   allowed us to better understand the technical performance of the method
   during a bloom event. The periodate screen substantially overestimated
   the true PST level in the samples because several PSTs gave co-eluting
   oxidation products, and it was assumed that the entire peak was due to
   the presence of the more toxic congener. The ratio between the screen
   and confirmation test results remained relatively constant throughout
   the bloom events. This information supports an amendment to the overly
   conservative regulatory control scheme employed in New Zealand for PST
   testing. Despite overestimation, the periodate screen has proved highly
   useful as it allows a quick determination of PST-free samples and
   provides a high level of security against harvesting contaminated
   products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a human foodborne intoxication caused
   by ingestion of tropical fishes contaminated with the potent polyether
   toxins known as ciguatoxins (CTXs). These toxins are issued from
   Gambierdiscus species of dinoflagellates. Herbivorous fish accumulate
   these toxins in their musculature and viscera after ingesting
   dinoflagellates. Epidemiological studies showed that CFP has been
   present in areas between 350 North and 350 South latitude, mainly,
   Indo-pacific and Caribbean areas, but not in waters closed to European
   and African continent. In the present paper, a specimen of Seriola
   dumerlii weighing 70 kg and a smaller Seriola fasciata specimen,
   captured in waters belonging to Selvagens Islands (Madeira Arquipelago),
   were analyzed. Fishes from this genus were implicated in previous
   suspected ciguatera poisoning outbreaks in the Portuguese Madeira
   Arquipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean. Analysis was performed by two
   approaches, a functional method using cerebellar granule cells and by
   ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)
   method. The study was carried out in one portion of the tail muscle of
   Seriola fasciata and five parts of the body of Seriola dumerili (tail
   muscle, head, ventral muscle, mid muscle, and liver). The functional
   method consisted in the modification of the inward sodium current in
   cerebellar granule cells and the chemical method was a high resolution
   chromatography, which allowed elucidating the toxin profile in the
   samples. In addition, UPLC-MS technique was optimized and used for
   detecting and quantifying CTXs for the first time. After fish extraction
   and clean up, the chromatograms revealed the presence of CTX-1B at
   1111.6 m/z, CTX-3C at 1023.5 m/z, a CTX analogue at 1040.6 m/z, and a
   CIX from the Caribbean or Indic waters at 1141.6 m/z. Therefore, the
   results obtained in the present paper for both methods confirm, for the
   first time, the presence of CTX in fish from Madeira Arquipelago.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the in vivo effects of microcystins on gene
   expression of several phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP) in the
   freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea with two different exposure
   scenarios. Clams were exposed for 96 h to 5 mu g L-1 of dissolved
   microcystin-LR and the relative changes of gene expression of three
   different types of PPP (PPP1, 2 and 4) were analyzed by quantitative
   real-time PCR. The results showed a significant induction of PPP2 gene
   expression in the visceral mass. In contrast, the cyanotoxin did not
   cause any significant changes on PPP1 and PPP4 gene expression. Based on
   these results, we studied alterations in transcriptional patterns in
   parallel with enzymatic activity of C. fluminea for PPP2, induced by a
   Microcystis aeruginosa toxic strain (1 x 10(5) cells cm(-3)) during 96
   h. The relative changes of gene expression and enzyme activity in
   visceral mass were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and
   colorimetric assays respectively. The clams exhibited a significant
   reduction of PPP2 activity with a concomitant enhancement of gene
   expression. Considering all the results we can conclude that the
   exposure to an ecologically relevant concentration of pure or
   intracellular microcystins (-LR) promoted an in vivo effect on PPP2 gene
   expression in C. fluminea.},

Title = {Harmful effects of Dinophysis to the ciliate Mesodinium
   rubrum: Implications for prey capture},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {82-90},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Toxigenic Dinophysisspp. are obligate mixotrophic dinoflagellates that
   require a constant supply of prey Mesodinium rubrum to achieve long-term
   growth by means of kleptoplasty. Mesodinium rubrum is, however, a fast
   moving, jumping ciliate exhibiting an effective escape response from
   suspensivorous predators. In the present study, a series of laboratory
   experiments evaluating the motility and survival of M. rubrum in the
   presence of Dinophysis cells andiorsubstances contained in their culture
   medium was designed, in order to assess the mechanisms involved in prey
   capture by Dinophysis spp. Cell abundance of M. rubrum decreased in the
   presence of Dinophysis cf. ovum cells producing okadaic acid (OA; up to
   7.94 +/- 2.67 pg cell(-1)) and smaller amounts of dinophysistoxin-1
   (DTX-1) and pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2). Prey capture was often observed
   after the ciliate had been attached to adhesive ``mucus traps{''}, which
   only appeared in the presence of Dinophysis cells. Before being attached
   to the mucus traps, M. rubrum cells reduced significantly their swimming
   frequency (from similar to 41 to 19 +/- 3 jumps min(-1)) after only 4 h
   of initial contact with D. cf. ovum cells. M. rubrum survival was not
   affected in contact with purified OA, DTX1 and PTX-2 solutions, but
   decreased significantly when the ciliate was exposed to cell-free or
   filtered culture medium from both D. cf. ovum and D. caudata, the latter
   containing moderate concentrations of free eicosapentaenoic acid and
   docosahexaenoic acid. The results thus indicate that Dinophysis combines
   the release of toxic compounds other than shellfish toxins, possibly
   free PUFA5, and a ``mucus trap{''} to enhance its prey capture success
   by immobilizing and subsequently arresting M. rubrum cells. (C) 2016

Title = {Gene network analysis reveals the responsive cascades of scallop
   (Patinopecten yessoensis) exposed to toxic Alexandrium
   catenella},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {210},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As filter-feeding bivalves, scallops exhibit remarkable tolerance to
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by Alexandrium
   dinoflagellates, yet the molecular mechanisms enabling concurrent PST
   accumulation and physiological resilience remain poorly understood.
   Here, we integrated transcriptomics and weighted gene coexpression
   network analysis (WGCNA) to dissect dynamic gene networks in scallop
   digestive glands during a 15-day exposure to PST-producing algae. We
   identified eight responsive modules, with the hub module M4 coordinating
   all phases of xenobiotic metabolism: phase I oxidation (CYP enzymes),
   phase II conjugation (GST/ GGT), and phase III efflux (MRP
   transporters). Module M19 uniquely modulated glutathione (GSH)
   homeostasis by suppressing tyrosinase (TYR) during peak detoxification
   (Days 5-10) to prioritize toxin conjugation, followed by TYR activation
   to reset GSH levels post-exposure (Day 15). Notably, neural-related
   modules (M3, M6) counteracted PST neurotoxicity by restoring ion
   homeostasis through epithelial sodium channels (SCNNG) and regulating
   neurotransmitter dynamics (SLC6, ACH). Crucially, the coordinated
   interactions between up- and down-regulated modules, as inferred from
   dynamic gene expression patterns in xenobiotic metabolism, neural
   homeostasis, and detoxification pathways, collectively suggest a
   potential role in mitigating PST-producing algae-induced cellular
   damage. This study reveals a dual-functional gene network in scallop
   digestive glands that balances PST hyperaccumulation with multi-layered
   detoxification, providing mechanistic insights into bivalve adaptation
   to harmful algal blooms.},

Title = {Spliced leader-based analyses reveal the effects of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons on gene expression in the copepod Pseudodiaptomus
   poplesia},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {114-126},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of toxic and
   carcinogenic pollutants that can adversely affect the development,
   growth and reproduction of marine organisms including copepods. However,
   knowledge on the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to PAH
   exposure in marine planktonic copepods is limited. In this study, we
   investigated the survival and gene expression of the calanoid copepod
   Pseudodiaptomus poplesia upon exposure to two PAHs, 1,
   2-dimethylnaphthalene (1, 2-NAPH) and pyrene. Acute toxicity responses
   resulted in 96-h LC50 of 788.98 mu g L-1 and 54.68 mu g L-1 for 1,
   2-NAPH and pyrene, respectively. Using the recently discovered copepod
   spliced leader as a primer, we constructed full-length cDNA libraries
   from copepods exposed to sublethal concentrations and revealed 289
   unique genes of diverse functions, including stress response genes and
   novel genes previously undocumented for this species. Eighty-three gene
   families were specifically expressed in PAH exposure libraries. We
   further analyzed the expression of seven target genes by reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR in a time-course test with three
   sublethal concentrations. These target genes have primary roles in
   detoxification, oxidative defense, and signal transduction, and include
   different forms of glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione
   peroxidases (GPX), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), methylmalonate-semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase (MSDH) and ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
   (RAC1). Expression stability of seven candidate reference genes were
   evaluated and the two most stable ones (RPL15 and RPS20 for 1, 2-NAPH
   exposure, RPL15 and EF1D for pyrene exposure) were used to normalize the
   expression levels of the target genes. Significant upregulation was
   detected in GST-T, GST-DE, GPX4, PRDX6 and RAC1 upon 1, 2-NAPH exposure,
   and GST-DE and MSDH upon pyrene exposure. These results indicated that
   the oxidative stress was induced and that signal transduction might be
   affected by PAH exposure in P. poplesia. However, gene upregulation was
   followed by a reduction in expression level towards 96 h, indicating a
   threshold value of exposure time that leads to depressed gene
   expression. Prolonged exposure may cause dysfunction of detoxification
   and antioxidant machinery in P. poplesia. The transcriptional responses
   of GST-T, GPX2 and GPX4 upon pyrene exposure were minimal. Our results
   reveal the different sensitivity of P. poplesia to two PAHs at both the
   individual and transcriptional levels. As the first attempt, this study
   proved that copepod spliced leader is useful for obtaining full-length
   cDNA in P. poplesia exposed to PAHs and provided a valuable gene
   resource for this non-model species. This approach can be applied to
   other calanoid copepods exposed to various stressors, particularly under
   field conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin found in many marine and
   terrestrial animals, but only a few species, such as the ribbon worms of
   the genus Cephalothrix, accumulate it in extremely high concentrations.
   The intrabody distribution of TTX in highly toxic organisms is of great
   interest because it helps researchers to understand the pathways by
   which the toxin migrates, accumulates, and functions in tissues. Using
   immunohistochemistry with anti-TTX antibodies, the authors of this study
   investigated the toxin's distribution inside the organs, tissues, and
   cells of Cephalothrix cf. simula. The cell types of TTX-positive tissues
   were identified by light microscopy. The main sites of TTX accumulation
   occurred in the secretory cells of the integuments, the microvilli of
   the epidermal ciliary cells, cephalic glands, the glandular epithelia of
   the proboscises, the enterocytes of the digestive systems, and
   nephridia. Obtained data suggest the toxin migrates from the digestive
   system through blood vessels to target organs. TTX is excreted from the
   body through the nephridia and mucus of epidermal cells.},

Abstract = {Contamination of bivalves with yessotoxins (YTXs) has been reported
   since 1987 in several coastal environments. In our study we investigated
   the accumulation and the metabolism of YTXs in 2 bivalve species
   important to German fisheries and aquaculture. Mussels and oysters.
   Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas, were exposed to the YTX-producing
   dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum isolated from the North Sea.
   Toxin profiles from algae and bivalves were analyzed by liquid
   chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). It was evident
   that 45-hydroxy YTX (45-OH YTX), carboxy YTX (COOH YTX), and the
   putative 45-hydroxy-carboxy YTX (45-OH-COOH YTX) were the dominant YTX
   analogues in M. edulis. The oyster C. gigas displayed a different toxin
   profile. YTX, 45-OH YTX, and 45-OH-COOH YTX were also present, but COOH
   YTX was not detectable. Furthermore, 2 unidentified analogues with the
   same MS/MS transition ({[}M-H](-) > {[}M-H-SO3](-)) occurred in both
   bivalve species. Homo YTX and 45-hydroxy-homo YTX, which are regulated
   together with YTX and 45-OH YTX in 2002/225 EC were not detected. In
   general, we confirmed former field investigations on accumulation and
   metabolism of YTXs in M. edulis; however, this is the first study on
   accumulation and metabolism of YTXs in the oyster C. gigas.},

Title = {Paralytic shellfish toxin profiles in mussel, cockle and razor shell
   under post-bloom natural conditions: Evidence of higher
   biotransformation in razor shells and cockles},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Concentrations of the paralytic shellfish toxins GTX6, C1+2, GTX5, C3+4,
   dcSTX, dcNEO and dcGTX2+3 were determined by LC-FLD in composite samples
   of whole soft tissues of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), cockles
   (Cerastodenna edule) and razor shells (Solen marginatus) after exposure
   to a Gymnodinium catenatum bloom. Specimens were harvested weekly during
   three months under natural depuration conditions in the Mira branch of
   Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. Under the decline of G. catenatum cell
   densities, elimination or transformation of the uptake toxins associated
   with the ingestion of toxic cells differed among the surveyed species.
   Ratio between the toxins dcSTX plus dcGTX2+3 plus dcNEO and toxins GTX6
   plus GTX5 plus C1+2 plus C3+4 was used to illustrate the
   biotransformation occurring in the bivalves. Enhancement of the ratios
   was observed for razor shells and cockles seven weeks after the peak of
   the algal bloom. Most likely it reflects more intense biotransformation
   in razor shells and cockles than in mussels. Conversion into toxins of
   higher toxicity may prolong the bivalve toxicity. These results show the
   complexity of toxin elimination in bivalves under post-bloom conditions
   and emphasize the pertinence of monitoring programs of bivalve toxicity
   in order to protect human health.},

Title = {Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Gene Diversity in the Crustacean
   Calanus finmarchicus - Contributors to Cellular Detoxification},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Detoxification is a fundamental cellular stress defense mechanism, which
   allows an organism to survive or even thrive in the presence of
   environmental toxins and/or pollutants. The glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) superfamily is a set of enzymes involved in the detoxification
   process. This highly diverse protein superfamily is characterized by
   multiple gene duplications, with over 40 GST genes reported in some
   insects. However, less is known about the GST superfamily in marine
   organisms, including crustaceans. The availability of two de novo
   transcriptomes for the copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, provided an
   opportunity for an in depth study of the GST superfamily in a marine
   crustacean. The transcriptomes were searched for putative GST-encoding
   transcripts using known GST proteins from three arthropods as queries.
   The identified transcripts were then translated into proteins, analyzed
   for structural domains, and annotated using reciprocal BLAST analysis.
   Mining the two transcriptomes yielded a total of 41 predicted GST
   proteins belonging to the cytosolic, mitochondrial or microsomal
   classes. Phylogenetic analysis of the cytosolic GSTs validated their
   annotation into six different subclasses. The predicted proteins are
   likely to represent the products of distinct genes, suggesting that the
   diversity of GSTs in C. finmarchicus exceeds or rivals that described
   for insects. Analysis of relative gene expression in different
   developmental stages indicated low levels of GST expression in embryos,
   and relatively high expression in late copepodites and adult females for
   several cytosolic GSTs. A diverse diet and complex life history are
   factors that might be driving the multiplicity of GSTs in C.
   finmarchicus, as this copepod is commonly exposed to a variety of
   natural toxins. Hence, diversity in detoxification pathway proteins may
   well be key to their survival.},

Title = {Spatial variability and depuration of tetrodotoxin in the bivalve
   Paphies australis from New Zealand},
Journal = {TOXICON-X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin responsible for many human
   intoxications globally. Despite its potency and widespread occurrence in
   taxonomically diverse species, the primary source of TTX remains
   uncertain. Paphies australis, an endemic clam found in New Zealand, has
   been found to contain TTX in several locations. However, it is unknown
   if this represents endogenous production or accumulation from an
   external source. To address this question, the concentrations of TTX in
   whole P. australis and dissected organs (siphons, foot, digestive gland
   and the `rest') from thirteen sites around New Zealand were determined
   using liquid chromato-graphy-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry
   analysis (LC-MS/MS). Depuration rate of TTX was also investigated by
   harvesting and measuring concentrations in P. australis maintained in
   captivity on a toxin-free diet every three to 15 days for 150 days. The
   LC-MS/MS analyses of the spatial samples showed that TTX was present in
   P. australis from all regions tested, with significantly (p < 0.001)
   higher concentrations (15-50 mu g kg(-1)) observed at lower latitudes of
   the North Island compared with trace levels (0.5-3 mu g kg(-1)) in the
   South Island of New Zealand. Tetrodotoxin was detected in all the
   dissected organs but the siphons contained the highest concentrations of
   TTX at all sites analysed. A linear model of the depuration data
   identified a significant (p < 0.001) decline in total TTX concentrations
   in P. australis over the study period. The siphons maintained the
   highest amount of TTX across the entire depuration study. The digestive
   glands contained low concentrations at the start of the experiment, but
   this depurated rapidly and only traces remained after 21 days. These
   results provide evidence to suggest that P. australis does not produce
   TTX endogenously but obtains the neurotoxin from an exogenous source
   (e.g., diet) with the source more prevalent in warmer northern waters.
   The association of higher TTX concentrations in shellfish with warmer
   environments raises concerns that this toxin's distribution and
   abundance could become an increasing human health issue with global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Cnidarian venoms are potentially valuable tools for biomedical research
   and drug development. They are contained within nematocysts, the
   stinging organelles of cnidarians. Several methods exist for the
   isolation of nematocysts from cnidarian tissues; most are tedious and
   target nematocysts from specific tissues. We have discovered that the
   isolated active nematocyst complement (cnidome) of several sea anemone
   (Cnidaria: Anthozoa) species is readily accessible. These nematocysts
   are isolated, concentrated, and released to the aqueous environment as a
   by-product of aeolid nudibranch Spurilla neapolitana cultures. S.
   neapolitana feed on venomous sea anemones laden with stinging
   nematocysts. The ingested stinging organelles of several sea anemone
   species are effectively excreted in the nudibranch feces. We succeeded
   in purifying the active organelles and inducing their discharge. Thus,
   our current study presents the attractive possibility of using
   nudibranchs to produce nematocysts for the investigation of novel marine

Title = {Identification of Monitoring Organ in Bivalves for Early Warning of
   Paralytic Shellfish Toxins Accumulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {251-257},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Bivalve farming plays a dominant role in mariculture in China. Paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) can be accumulated in bivalves and cause
   poisoning the consumers. A sensitive detection of PSTs can provide early
   warning to decrease poisoning events in bivalve consuming. PSTs are
   traditionally examined using the whole soft-tissues. However, PSTs
   accumulation varies dramatically in different tissues of bivalves. Some
   tough tissues/organs (such as mantle), which account for a large
   proportion of the total soft body, exhibit a lower accumulation of PSTs
   and make the toxin extraction time- and reagent-consuming, potentially
   decreasing the accuracy and sensitivity of PSTs monitoring in bivalves.
   To develop a sensitive and cost-effective approach for PSTs examination
   in massively farmed bivalves, we fed three commercially important
   bivalves, Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, Pacific oyster
   Crassostrea gigas, and blue mussel Mytilus edulis with PSTs-producing
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, and detected PSTs concentration in
   different tissues. For all three bivalve species, the digestive gland
   accumulated much more PSTs than other tissues, and the digestive gland's
   toxicity was significantly correlated with the PSTs toxicity of the
   whole soft-tissues, with r(2) = 0.94, 0.92, and 0.94 for Yesso scallop,
   Pacific oyster, and blue mussel, respectively. When the toxicity of the
   whole soft-tissues reached 80 mu g STXeq(100g)(-1), the regulatory limit
   for commercial shellfish, the digestive gland's toxicity reached 571.48,
   498.90, and 859.20 mu g STXeq(100g)(-1) in Yesso scallop, Pacific
   oyster, and blue mussel, respectively. Our results indicate that
   digestive gland can be used for the sensitive and cost-effective
   monitoring of PSTs in bivalves.},

Title = {Environmental factors driving microcystin contamination of estuarine
   bivalve populations downstream of freshwater cyanobacterial blooms},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {214},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Estuaries are dynamic environments that provide vital habitat to
   ecologically and commercially important bivalves. In some cases,
   freshwater tributaries can introduce cyanobacteria and associated
   cyanotoxins into estuaries that may subsequently accumulate in estuarine
   bivalves. Temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs), which only
   experience tidal input for limited periods of time, may be particularly
   vulnerable to the accumulation of cyanotoxins in bivalves as they can be
   subject to freshwater input without tidal flushing and may experience
   lower salinities and cyanobacterial blooms. This study quantified levels
   of microcystin in bivalves collected as a time series over a five-year
   period (2017-2021) from Mecox Bay, a TOCE on Long Island, NY, USA, that
   hosts a productive oyster fishery and is downstream of a freshwater body
   that hosts microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms. During the
   study, microcystin was detected in all bivalves monitored including
   Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis),
   and soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), with levels in oysters exceeding
   those in other species and frequently exceeding 10 ng g(-1), the
   California regulatory action level for microcystin in tissue. While
   oysters were capable of depurating 60-90 \% of microcystin after
   four-to-six weeks during summer, microcystin loads in bivalves often
   peaked in cooler months after water column cyanobacteria and microcystin
   levels had seasonally declined, suggesting toxin depuration slowed at
   colder temperatures. Multiple linear regression models established that
   time-integrated measurements of pelagic microcystin concentrations in
   freshwater and estuarine locations, water temperature (inverse
   correlation), and salinity had highly significant (r(2) = 0.71; p <
   0.001) predictive power of the microcystin content in oysters. These
   findings demonstrate that bivalves, particularly oysters, in TOCEs
   located downstream of microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms are
   vulnerable to microcystin contamination, especially during fall months
   when temperature-dependent toxin depuration rates are likely slow.},

   Gymnodinium catenatum to nitrate deficiency},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {208},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The paralytic shellfish toxin producing dinoflagellate Gymnodinium
   catenatum is a globally distributed species and often forms massive
   blooms. However, the physiological and molecular responses of G.
   catenatum to nitrate starvation have not been thoroughly investigated.
   Our results showed that multiple forms of N could be utilized by G.
   catenatum under nitrate-deficient conditions. Nitrate deficiency
   adversely affected the growth, cellular Chlorophyll a (Chl a) content,
   and toxin production of G. catenatum. Transcriptomic analysis revealed
   significant down-regulation of gene expressions involved in the light
   reaction of photosynthesis, while genes related to fatty acids synthesis
   and antioxidation were significantly upregulated in the N-depleted
   cultures. Our results suggested that excess carbon was channeled into
   lipid synthesis for energy storage, and antioxidant reactions were
   upregulated to eliminate toxic peroxides caused by nitrate limitation.
   These findings highlight the adaptative strategy of G. catenatum in
   low-nitrate environments, which are crucial factors driving its bloom
   formation.},

   accumulation and pathological aspects},
Journal = {MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-72},
Abstract = {Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis have become common along
   rocky shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to health problems
   for beach-goers, Ostreopsis toxins may accumulate in benthic marine
   animals used for human consumption, which however at times have shown
   signals of stress and even mortality. In order to elucidate the actual
   relationships between Ostreopsis and benthic invertebrates, we exposed
   mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus
   from the Gulf of Naples to cultures and natural material of O. cf. ovata
   and assessed feeding and adverse effects on the animals, along with
   their acquired toxicity. Mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata for 24 hours
   filtered the microalgae at different rates, depending on both mussel
   size and microalgal density, and became weakly toxic in some cases.
   Under longer exposure most animals died and all survivors were toxic.
   Detoxification of a naturally toxic mussel populations from an area
   affected by O. cf. ovata blooms took more than two weeks. Sea urchins
   fed with the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis epiphytised by O. cf.
   ovata did not show damages and became mildly toxic in some cases.
   However, the direct exposure of sea urchins to O. cf. ovata cultures
   caused the partial or total loss of the spines in a density-dependent
   way, with the death of the animals at the highest microalgal
   concentrations. Milder effects were registered with sonicated cultures
   or toxin extracts. Our results indicate that the balance between
   toxicity and animal health in these invertebrates depends on the mode
   and intensity of exposure to the toxic microalga, while the response
   varies between the two species but also within the same species. This
   scenario matches the variety of responses of benthic populations
   recorded in the natural environment in areas affected by O. cf. ovata
   blooms.},

Abstract = {Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck) were exposed to the toxic
   cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. emend Elkin for 16 days in
   order to study bioaccumulation of the cyclic heptapeptide toxin
   microcystin-LR. After this time period the animals were fed marine
   phytoplankton for 2 weeks and the amount of microcystin in the mussels
   was monitored again. During the exposure phase mussels attained a
   maximum of 10.5 mu g of toxin per g dry mussel weight at day 10.
   Microcystin was detectable after the second day of exposure. The
   percentage of toxin that was taken up relative to the total amount
   administered varied from 24.1\% to 54.8\%. When the mussels were fed
   marine phytoplankton there was a 50\% decrease in the amount of
   detectable toxin in the mussels within 2 days. This was followed by a
   slight increase in toxin levels over 5 days with no microcystin-LR being
   detected at day 13. The major part of the toxin (96\%) was found in the
   digestive gland + stomach while the gills, muscle, foot, and other
   organs combined had less than 4\% of the total toxin. The results
   presented here show that cyanobacteria blooms present in estuaries where
   bivalves are growing naturally constitute a health hazard in that these
   organisms can retain microcystins and transfer them through the food

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},

Pages = {71-83},
Abstract = {The influence of hydrographic, biological and meteorological variables
   on the abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the concentration of diarrhetic
   shellfish toxin (DST) in the plankton population were investigated in a
   mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm area on the Swedish west coast. This
   location provided an opportunity to simultaneously compare Dinophysis
   spp. cell numbers, concentration of DST in natural phytoplankton
   assemblages and toxicity of mussel tissues. Sampling was performed every
   other day from October 10 to November 5, 2000, and on each occasion, 5
   randomly selected sites were sampled. During this period, 3 distinct
   water masses passed through the vicinity of the mussel farm. The second
   water mass, characterized by low salinity and nitrogen concentration,
   was probably advected into the area from surface waters in the nearby
   Skagerrak. This low salinity water also contained a high abundance of
   Dinophysis spp., and high concentrations of DST were recorded in the
   phytoplankton population. Multivariate analysis (projection to latent
   structures by means of partial least squares, PLS) determined that the
   principal variables influencing the concentration of DST in the plankton
   assemblage were the causative species (D. acuminata, D. acuta and D.
   norvegica) and salinity. The abundance of the 3 Dinophysis spp. was
   inversely correlated to salinity. A rapid increase in the toxicity of
   mussels in response to the high levels of DST was observed. The
   concentration of DST had doubled within 2 d of the appearance of
   Dinophysis spp. After 8 d, the water mass containing Dinophysis spp. was
   replaced and cell numbers again returned to low levels. The
   concentration of DST in the phytoplankton samples remained high for
   another 2 d after the number of Dinophysis spp. had declined and the
   toxicity of mussels continued to be high for the remainder of the study.
   Causes of the rapid intoxication versus slow detoxification of mussels
   are discussed. These results suggest that present monitoring programs
   are insufficient to provide early warning of toxic blooms to
   aquaculturists on the Swedish west coast.},

   feeding activity was measured during the first days of exposure to the
   PSP toxins (days 0 and 2), followed by a period of recovery observed on
   days 5 and 9, when the clearance rate of the contaminated mussels
   significantly increased. During the detoxification period, the
   contaminated bivalves showed a total recovery of clearance rate, and no
   significant differences were observed between contaminated and control
   groups. The intoxication dynamic was characterised by a rapid and
   sustained increase in the amount of PSP toxins accumulated in the
   tissues of the bivalves. Due to this increase, the level of PSP toxins
   critical for human consumption was reached on the first day, and at the
   end of the intoxication period, the mussels had accumulated 1601 mu g
   STX eq. 100 g(-1) tissue. During the detoxification period, a decrease
   of PSP toxins was observed, down to 319 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1) tissue.
   The lower clearance rates observed over the first days of exposure would
   produce a decrease in the energy intake and could affect the rate of
   growth of juveniles. Despite this initial effect, the rapid intoxication
   capacity of M. chilensis corroborates that this species is a good
   indicator for the early detection of harmful algal blooms.},

   a unique toxicological profile. The need for structural integrity of the
   aliphatic 7-membered cyclic imine for the potent bioactivity of
   pinnatozins has been experimentally demonstrated. In this study, we
   probe interconversion of the natural cyclic imine and its open form,
   pinnatoxin A amino ketone (PnTX AK), under physiologically relevant
   aqueous conditions. Our studies demonstrate the high stability of PnTX
   A. The unusual stability of the imine ring in PnTX A has implications
   for its oral toxicity and detoxification. These studies, as well the
   access to PnTX amino ketone, were enabled by the total synthesis of

Title = {Expansion of C1Q Genes in Zhikong Scallop and Their Expression
   Profiling After Exposure to the Toxic Dinoflagellates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {C1Q (Complement 1Q) is an important recognition molecule in the
   immunological complement system, which could also be putatively involved
   in the stress responses induced by endotoxins or exotoxins, potentially
   through detoxification processes. Marine bivalves are well adapted to
   highly complex aquatic environments with various stressors. As filter
   feeders, they have to cope with highly potent microalgae-derived
   neurotoxins, such as paralytic shellfish toxin (PSTs). Zhikong scallops,
   Chlamys farreri, are commercially important bivalve with the remarkable
   ability to accumulate PSTs. Exploring the C1Qs related to PST
   accumulation in C. farreri could benefit our understanding of the
   adaptations of bivalve species. In the present study, we systematically
   analyzed C1Q genes in C. farreri. In total, 97 CfC1Q genes mainly from
   the expanded C1Q-B subfamily were identified, from which the C1QL,
   C1QTNF, and C1QDC1 members in C. farreri were revealed to be under
   positive selection. Spatiotemporal expression analysis revealed that
   most CfC1QLs and CfC1QDC1s were highly expressed during the post-umbo
   stage and in hepatopancreas, while most CfC1QTNF members were highly
   expressed after the creeping larva stage and in mantle. The
   hepatopancreas and kidney in C. farreri are two toxin-rich organs with
   the highest concentrations of PSTs, acting as major ``centers{''} for
   toxin accumulation and transformation, respectively. Therefore, after
   feeding the scallops with PST-producing dinoflagellates Alexandrium
   minutum and Alexandrium catenella, we determined the expression patterns
   of CfC1Qs in these two organs. In kidney, more than 85\% of CfC1QLs and
   CfC1QDC1s showed drastic up-regulation with both diets. However, among
   these members with significant induction, a different response manner
   was detected after feeding with A. minutum and A. catenella,
   respectively as acute and chronic response patterns. In comparison, far
   fewer CfC1Qs showing significant up-regulation in hepatopancreas with
   both toxic diets and only mild regulation pattern could be found. This
   organ-, toxin-, and time-dependent genetic regulation of CfC1Qs may
   contribute to the virulence difference on account of the tissue-specific
   or dinoflagellate-specific different toxin analogs composition, implying
   the possible involvement of CfC1Qs in PST transport and homeostasis. Our
   findings imply the functional diversity of scallop C1Q genes in coping
   with PST accumulation, which might be developed as potential molecular
   indicators for monitoring toxin accumulation in edible mollusks or
   provide insight into the lineage-specific adaptation of scallops for
   dealing with microalgal toxin challenges.},

Title = {Community changes of gut microbes highlight their importance in the
   adaptation of copepods to toxic dinoflagellates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Zooplankton grazers, like copepods, can feed on toxic microalgae and
   live normally. We hypothesize that gut microbial communities (GMCs) may
   contribute to the detoxification of the host by changing their
   compositions and recruiting more beneficial bacteria. Here, we measured
   the physiological responses of two copepod species (Acartia sp. and
   Paracalanus sp.) fed with toxic (Alexandrium tamarense) and non-toxic
   (Alexandrium andersonii) dinoflagellates, respectively. Both copepods
   maintained consistently high survival rates but slightly reduced
   ingestion rates when feeding upon the toxic dinoflagellate (when
   compared to the non-toxic one), suggesting a compensatory mechanism. The
   compositional variation of copepod GMCs, at the amplicon sequence
   variant (ASV) level, was mostly significantly different among copepod
   host species (R = 0.83, by ANOSIM test), while diet type played minor
   but significant roles. Under the toxic diet, Acartia sp. enriched only
   five ASVs while Paracalanus sp. recruited a wide range of taxa (38 ASVs)
   mostly belonging to Alphaproteobacteria (e.g., Rhodobacteraceae) and
   Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Alteromonadaceae). In contrast, when
   clustering GMCs by predicted functions, diet type was the key regulating
   factor, suggesting the functional convergence of copepod GMCs in
   response to algal toxins. This can be explained by the fact that most of
   the enriched bacteria under the toxic diet have similar functions on
   detoxification and maintaining the host homeostasis. This study deepens
   our understanding of the roles of GMC in the detoxification and
   adaptation mechanisms of copepods during harmful algal blooms.},

Title = {Elevated pCO2 may increase the edible safety risk of
   clams exposed to toxic Alexandrium spp.},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {954},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) have received increasing attention
   owing to their threat to the health of aquatic life and seafood
   consumers. This study evaluated the impacts of elevated atmospheric
   partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on the production of paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) in different Alexandrium spp. strains, together
   with its further effects on the bioaccumulation/elimination dynamics of
   PSTs in bivalves contaminated with PSTs from toxic dinoflagellates. Our
   results showed that elevated pCO(2) stimulated the growth of the two
   Alexandrium spp. (A. catenella and A. pacificum) isolated from the
   northern and southern coastal areas of China, respectively, and affected
   PST production including content and toxicity of the two strains
   differently. Further PSTs bioaccumulation/elimination in
   PSTs-contaminated Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum under high pCO(2)
   also occurred. It is worth noting the biotransformation of neosaxitoxin
   (NEO) with high toxicity through trophic transfer with effect of
   elevated pCO(2). When in microalgae cultured under the control (410 ppm)
   and elevated pCO(2) conditions (495 and 850 ppm), the proportion of NEO
   in the PST content produced by A. catenella was reduced from 11.1 to 6.4
   and 2.6 \%, while the proportion of NEO in A. pacificum was increased
   from 3.1 to 3.6 and 4.7 \%, respectively. NEO accounted for >50 \% of
   total PST contents in clams, which were biotransformed via transfer from
   dinoflagellates and higher pCO(2) enhanced this biotransformation
   leading to increased NEO accumulation. The negatively affected
   elimination of PSTs, especially NEO, in clams fed with A. catenella or
   A. pacificum, indicates that the detoxification of PSTs-contaminated
   clams may be more difficult under elevated pCO(2). This study provides
   reference for developing models to assess the safety of bivalves under
   the co-stress of environmental change and toxic HABs, suggesting that
   ocean acidification may lead to the higher safety risk of Manila clams
   exposed to toxic HAB dinoflagellates.},

   of the Toxin in Aquatic Systems},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This review is devoted to the marine bacterial producers of tetrodotoxin
   (TTX), a potent non-protein neuroparalytic toxin. In addition to the
   issues of the ecology and distribution of TTX-producing bacteria, this
   review examines issues relating to toxin migration from bacteria to
   TTX-bearing animals. It is shown that the mechanism of TTX extraction
   from toxin-producing bacteria to the environment occur through cell
   death, passive/active toxin excretion, or spore germination of
   spore-forming bacteria. Data on TTX microdistribution in toxic organs of
   TTX-bearing animals indicate toxin migration from the digestive system
   to target organs through the transport system of the organism. The role
   of symbiotic microflora in animal toxicity is also discussed: despite
   low toxin production by bacterial strains in laboratory conditions, even
   minimal amounts of TTX produced by intestinal microflora of an animal
   can contribute to its toxicity. Special attention is paid to methods of
   TTX detection applicable to bacteria. Due to the complexity of toxin
   detection in TTX-producing bacteria, it is necessary to use several
   methods based on different methodological approaches. Issues crucial for
   further progress in detecting natural sources of TTX investigation are
   also considered.},

Title = {Accumulation of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins in planktonic

Abstract = {Concentrations of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in toxic
   dinoflagellate cells and in marine planktonic copepods were monitored
   during the bloom of Alexandrium tamarense in Hiroshima Bay, western
   Japan. Concentration of the toxins retained by copepods was a function
   of the ambient toxin concentration, i.e. the product of A. tamarense
   cell density and cellular toxicity. The toxin concentration in copepods
   increased with the increase of toxicants in the seawater then leveled
   off, but decreased significantly at higher concentrations. In the field,
   the maximum toxin concentration was 1.2 pmol ind(-1), whereas in the
   laboratory, the copepod Acartia omorii accumulated a much higher
   concentration of PSP toxins (24 pmol ind(-1)). Feeding avoidance against
   Alexandrium tamarense and a shift to alternative food sources such as
   diatoms in the field might keep their toxin levels lower than their
   potentially maximum level. The copepod toxin levels in the field were
   not so high as to cause an instantaneous lethal effect on their predator
   fishes but may reach possibly lethal levels after a few days' continuous
   feeding. Overall toxin retention by copepods after 12 h feeding and 2 h
   starvation was only 2.5\% of total ingested toxins, which suggested that
   a significant amount of toxins was released into the seawater.
   Measurements of toxin reduction and gut evacuation suggested that the
   toxins were removed through both fecal evacuation and metabolism (e.g.
   excretion, decomposition and transformation). The results, as a whole,
   imply that copepods can be a link for PSP toxin flux in both pelagic and
   benthic food webs and can also be a sink for toxins by metabolizing and
   removing them from the environment.},

   System},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {26},

Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/Nuclear factor
   E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway is a key mechanism that responds to
   oxidative stress and xenobiotic stimuli in vertebrates. However,
   knowledge of its evolutionary origins remains limited. In this study, we
   identify the ancestral homologues of KEAP1 and NRF (BjKEAP1 and BjNRF)
   in cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma japonicum). BjNRF uniquely
   combines the feature domains of vertebrates NRF1 and NRF2, marking it as
   an evolutionary intermediate. High expression levels of Bjkeap1 and
   Bjnrf in the gill, hepatic cecum, and intestine highlight their roles in
   environmental defense at key interface tissues. Functional studies
   reveal that BjKEAP1 regulates the cytoplasmic localization of BjNRF.
   Typical NRF2 activator sulforaphane (SFN) induces its nuclear
   translocation and significantly elevates the transcriptional expression
   of BjNRF and phase II detoxification enzymes. Moreover, exposure to the
   environmental toxin Benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP) activates this stress
   response system. These findings bridge critical gaps in our
   understanding of this pathway in basal chordates and offer new insights
   into the evolutionary trajectory of the KEAP1-NRF system. Furthermore,
   this study highlights crucial implications for the conservation of
   amphioxus in deteriorating marine environments.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of oyster beds in the northern Arabian Gulf
   Coast of the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The United Arab of Emirates (UAE) hosts valuable coastal and marine
   biodiversity, and oysters are one of the habitants of its marine
   ecosystem. Oysters play an essential role in the nearshore coasts where
   they work as an active filter. They filter nutrients, phytoplankton,
   sediments, heavy metals, and toxins out of the water, which improves the
   water quality. This is the first study that characterizes oyster bed
   habitats in the UAE by analyzing water quality parameters, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)and heavy
   metals in water, sediments and oyster samples collected from five
   locations along the coasts of Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm al Quwain. Oyster
   bed areas supported a diverse assemblage of benthic life including
   oysters, scallops, pen shells, hard corals, and macroalgae. Mobile
   species in these habitats included groupers, emperors, snappers, sea
   snakes, among others. The phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by
   diatoms, dinoflagellates, and small cryptophytes. Harmful diatom
   Pseudonitzschia was found in all locations. No detectable concentrations
   of PAHs and OCPs were reported in this study, and water quality
   parameters were within the acceptable levels for the region. On the
   other hand, water quality index was reported marginal, mostly due to the
   presence of higher than acceptable concentrations of chromium and
   mercury in all sites studied. Bioconcentration factors concluded that
   oysters were able to bioconcentrate metals such as arsenic, cadmium,
   chromium, and zinc, when compared to water. No detectable concentrations
   of lead and mercury were reported in oysters, suggesting higher
   depuration rates for those metals.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a decay equation for paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) toxins using long-term field data spanning more than 10
   years in order to predict the detoxification period for the scallop
   Patinopecten yessoensis in Ofunato Bay, Japan. From the data, we
   obtained the date of maximum toxicity in the digestive gland (DG) of the
   scallop and then the date of detoxification. Next, we performed linear
   regression analysis between log(e)-toxicities and days after the maximum
   toxicity level for each study year. Toxicity declined at a rate of 1.5
   \%/day, and a period of 3-9 months was required for the scallop to
   achieve a toxicity level of 20 mouse units (MU)/g DG tissue, which is a
   critical level for determining monitoring frequency and area of scallop
   toxicity. We then estimated the number of days needed to reach 20 MU/g
   DG tissue (t (20)) using the equations obtained by the above-mentioned
   analysis, and we performed another linear regression analysis between
   the log(e) (maximum toxicity) and t (20) for each year. The difference
   between the actual and predicted detoxification time ranged from -16 to
   18 days. We conclude that these equations can be used to predict the
   depuration of PSP toxins from scallops in Ofunato Bay.},

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},

Abstract = {Bivalves (e.g., clams, oysters, mussels, scallops) are a significant
   part of the global diet and are harvested for their nutritional value,
   but as filter feeders they are susceptible to the accumulation of toxins
   produced by certain species of phytoplankton. Karlotoxins (KmTxs) are a
   class of amphidinol-like compounds with hemolytic, ichthyotoxic, and
   cytotoxic properties that have been associated with harmful algal
   blooms, and the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum uses KmTxs to
   facilitate prey capture and deter grazing by other organisms. In this
   work, we examined the accumulation and depuration of 4,5-dihydro-KmTx2,
   a karlotoxin previously isolated from K. veneficum, in two bivalves with
   different life habits, i.e., Sinonovacula constricta Lamarck and
   Mercenaria mercenaria Linnaeus. After both bivalves received K.
   veneficum GM5 in their feed for a long period of 10 days,
   4,5dihydro-KmTx2 was accumulated considerably in the visceral mass, but
   there was almost no toxin accumulation in the muscle. The accumulation
   was more severe for M. mercenaria than S. constricta. The toxin was
   cleared almost completely from the bivalves 5 days after K. veneficum
   GM5 was removed from the feed. For both bivalves, the bait microalgae I.
   galbana slowed both the accumulation and the depuration of the toxin.},

Title = {A demographic model to forecast Dinophysis acuminata harmful
   algal blooms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in marine environments have significant
   adverse effects on public health, aquaculture and recreational
   activities. Surges of certain phytoplanktonic toxin-producing microalgae
   (mostly dinoflagellates or diatoms species) can induce Amnesic,
   Diarrhetic or Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP, DSP and PSP). Among
   HAB species, the genus Dinophysis leads to DSP in human consumers; this
   being the most recurrent problem in the Iberian Peninsula with the
   biggest economic impact on clam production and harvesting. While
   complete elimination of HABs is not feasible, timely implementation of
   appropriate measures can prevent their negative consequences. This is
   critical for aquaculture. Research on D. acuminata (dominant Dinophysis
   species in the North Atlantic) has been focused on ecophysiology and
   population dynamics, although with few modelling attempts. Weekly
   monitoring along the Portuguese coast since 2006 has revealed that D.
   acuminata thrives under spring/summer photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) coupled with water temperatures below 20 degrees C,
   which typically coincide with the local upwelling regime. In order to
   advance this knowledge numerically, we developed a demographic model
   linking D. acuminata growth rate to PAR and sea surface temperature
   (SST). The 13-year (1-Jan-2006 to 31-Dec-2018) time-series of
   observations was closely fit by model forecasts. However, the model
   demonstrated limitations in issuing timely warnings of harmful
   proliferation of D. acuminata, failing to do so in 50\% of cases, and
   issuing incorrect warnings in 5\% of the cases. Furthermore, improving
   the odds of emitting timely warnings always worsened the odds of
   emitting false warnings, and vice-versa. To simultaneously improve both
   aspects, the modelling results clearly indicated the need of
   implementing both census/projection intervals smaller than 7 days and a
   laboratory detection limit below 20 cell/L. The time resolution of the
   census and of the model proved to be the most limiting factor that must
   be addressed in order to improve numerical forecasting of HABs.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins are highly toxic natural
   compounds produced by dinoflagellates commonly present in marine
   phytoplankton. Shellfish contaminated with these toxins create
   significant public health threat and economic losses to the shellfish
   industry. For this reason, several methods of high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection have been developed in
   order to gain better knowledge of toxins profiles in shellfish and
   dinoflagellates samples. These methods have been subjected to continuous
   modifications to improve and shorten the run time of analysis in the
   routine monitoring control. In this paper, different samples are
   analyzed by pre- and post-column HPLC methods to compare toxin profiles.
   All PSP toxins were individually identified and quantified within the
   post-column oxidation method. However, although the pre-column oxidation
   method is significantly more sensitive and detects lower toxin levels,
   it provides a total amount of toxins that co-elute together, as GTX2 and
   3, GTX1 and 4 and dcGTX2 and dcGTX3. The results obtained by both HPLC
   methods showed similar toxin concentration (expressed in mu g/mL) in
   mussel samples, however when dinoflagellates samples were analyzed the
   toxin profile and concentration were different. In summary, the
   post-column oxidation method is accurate to determine the amount of each
   individual PSP toxin and to know the real toxic profile of
   non-transformed samples. In addition, this method is easy and faster to
   screen a large number of samples. The pre-column HPLC method is useful
   when mussel samples are analyzed even though the time required to
   prepare the samples is longer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Consuming poisoned shellfish can lead to severe health problems and even
   death. Alexandrium catenella (Group I) and A. pacificum (Group IV) cause
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in Korea, and PSP is detected more
   in a wider area. However, the association between toxic dinoflagellates
   and shellfish poisoning is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to
   understand the toxicity, detoxification, and compositional differences
   in PSP in Mytilus edulis exposed to PSP caused by A. catenella and A.
   pacificum. High-performance liquid chromatography with post-column
   oxidation was used to analyze PSP toxicity in poisoned M. edulis. PSP in
   M. edulis increased as the A. catenella and A. pacificum cell density
   increased. However, the cell density of A. catenella peaked faster than
   that of A. pacificum, and a high level of toxicity was detected. In the
   detoxification experiment, PSP in M. edulis decreased rapidly within 24
   h in filtered seawater. However, PSP was continuously detected without
   decreasing below the detection limit until the last day of the
   experiment. In addition, the carbamate composition (GTX1+4) was detected
   as the main toxic composition in poisoned M. edulis, unlike in
   vegetative cells. GTX1+4 can poison shellfish quickly when toxic
   dinoflagellates appear in the marine environment. However, poisoned
   shellfish take a long time to be completely detoxified. Moreover, if
   shellfish continuously feed on poisonous dinoflagellates, their toxicity
   can increase rapidly due to biotransformation. Our results can help
   identify the mechanisms of shellfish toxicity and detoxification after
   PSP caused by toxic dinoflagellates.},

Abstract = {Samples of toxic scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) and clam (Saxidomus
   purpuratus) collected on the northern coast of China from 2008 to 2009
   were analysed. High-performance liquid chromatography with post-column
   oxidation and fluorescence detection was used to determine the profile
   of the main paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in these samples
   and their total toxicity. Hydrophilic interaction liquid ion
   chromatography with mass spectrometric detection confirmed the toxin
   profile and detected several metabolites in the shellfish. Results show
   that C1/2 toxins were the most dominant toxins in the scallop and clam
   samples. However, GTX1/4 and GTX2/3 were also present. M1 was the
   predominant metabolite in all the samples, but M3 and M5 were also
   identified, along with three previously unreported presumed metabolites,
   M6, M8 and M10. The results indicate that the biotransformation of
   toxins was species specific. It was concluded that the reductive enzyme
   in clams is more active than in scallops and that an enzyme in scallops
   is more apt to catalyse hydrolysis of both the sulfonate moiety at the
   N-sulfocabamoyl of C toxins and the 11-hydroxysulfate of C and GTX
   toxins to produce metabolites. This is the first report of new
   metabolites of PSP toxins in scallops and clams collected in China.},

Journal = {WATER RESEARCH X},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Research on interactions between grazers and toxigenic algae is
   fundamental for understanding toxin dynamics within aquatic ecosystems
   and developing biotic approaches to mitigate harmful algal blooms. The
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum is a well-known microalga responsible
   for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) contamination in many coastal
   regions worldwide. This study investigated the impact of the ciliate
   Euplotes balteatus on cell density and PSTs transfer in simulated A.
   minutum blooms under controlled conditions. E. balteatus exhibited
   resistance to the PSTs produced by A. minutum with a density of up to
   10,000 cells/mL, sustaining growth and reproduction while eliminating
   algal cells within a few days. The cellular PSTs content of A. minutum
   increased in response to the grazing pressure from E. balteatus .
   However, due to the substantial reduction in density, the overall
   toxicity of the algal population decreased to a negligible level. Most
   PSTs contained within algal cells were temporarily accumulated in E.
   balteatus before being released into the water column, suggesting
   unclear mechanisms for PSTs excretion in unicellular grazers. In
   principle, the grazing of E. balteatus on A. minutum promotes the
   transfer of the majority of intracellular PSTs into extracellular
   portions, thereby mitigating the risk of their accumulation and
   contamination through marine trophic pathways. However, this process
   also introduces an increase in the potential environmental hazards posed
   by extracellular PSTs to some extent.},

   LC-FLD in composite samples of digestive glands and gills of
   Cerastoderma edule cockle. The specimens were sampled in Aveiro lagoon,
   Portugal, under natural depuration conditions (days 0, 8, 12, 14, 19, 21
   and 25) after exposure to a bloom of Gymnodinium catenatum. Individual
   paralytic shellfish toxins indicated different pathways of elimination
   and biotransformation in digestive gland and gills. Toxin concentrations
   in gills were lower than in digestive gland. Most of the quantified
   toxins in digestive gland decreased during the 25 days of observation
   according to negative exponential curves, and only GTX5, GTX6 and NEO
   showed slight irregularities with time. Concentrations of C1+2, C3+4 and
   dcGTX2+3 in gills decreased progressively, however GTX5, GTX6 and dcSTX
   showed pronounced increases. Higher concentrations of those toxins in
   days 8 and 12 in comparison to the initial value (day 0) indicate
   conversion of other toxins into GTX5, GTX6 and dcSTX during those
   periods. It appears that inter-conversion of toxins occurs as G.
   catenatum cells are retained in gills before being transferred to other
   compartments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Environmental conditions are key factors in the development of marine
   toxic phytoplankton. Spirolides are marine toxins with a heptacyclic
   imine ring responsible for the toxicity in mice. Alexandrium ostenfeldii
   (A. ostenfeldii) is the main producer of these toxins, although this
   dinoflagellate often produces toxins belonging to the paralytic
   shellfish poisoning (PSP) group. The present study shows the first
   evidence that external environmental factors can influence the toxin
   profile produced by the dinoflagellate A. ostenfeldii. The species
   investigated is indigenous to the North Atlantic coast, and their cells
   grew under several environmental parameters. Toxin production was
   measured by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and
   the chromatograms reflect the presence of two spirolides in all
   cultures; one in the region m/z 692.5, corresponding to 13-desmethyl
   spirolide C (13-desMeC) and the other in the region m/z 678.5, which
   corresponds to 13,19-didesmethyl spirolide C (13,19-didesMeC). The
   physical parameters studied were salinity, culture media, and
   photoperiod. The highest amount of toxin per cell was obtained when
   dinoflagellates grew in F/2 and Walne medium, 28 parts per thousand
   salinity, and 24 h of light. However, the highest proportion of
   13,19-didesMeC with respect to 13-desMeC was achieved in L1 medium, 33
   parts per thousand salinity, and 14:10 h light:dark. On the contrary,
   the highest proportion of 13-desMeC in cells was obtained when A.
   ostenfeldii was Cultured in F/2 medium, 28 parts per thousand. salinity,
   and the same photoperiod. Therefore, from these data the optimum
   conditions to culture A. ostenfeldii and to obtain the highest amount of
   spirolide per cell are shown. In addition, these environmental
   conditions can be considered a tool to predict and avoid A. ostenfeldii
   blooms. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:301-310. (C) 2009 SETAC},

Title = {Toxicity and potential underlying mechanism of Karenia
   selliformis to the fish Oryzias melastigma},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {262},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Karenia selliformis can produce toxins such as gymnodimines, and form
   microalgal blooms causing massive mortality of marine life such as fish
   and shellfish, and resulting in serious economic losses. However, there
   are a few of studies on the toxic effects of K. selliformis on marine
   organisms and the underlying mechanisms, and it is not clear whether the
   toxins produced by K. selliformis affect fish survival through the food
   chain. In this study, a food chain was simulated and composed by K.
   selliformis-brine shrimp-marine medaka to investigate the possi-bility
   of K. selliformis toxicity transmission through the food chain, in which
   fish behavior, histopathology and transcriptomics changes were observed
   after direct or indirect exposure (through the food chain) of K.
   selliformis. We found that both direct and indirect exposure of K.
   selliformis could affect the swimming behavior of medaka, manifested as
   decreased swimming performance and increased ``frozen events{''}.
   Meanwhile, exposure to K. selliformis caused pathological damage to the
   intestine and liver tissues of medaka to different degree. The effect of
   direct exposure to K. selliformis on swimming behavior and damage to
   fish tissues was more severe. In addition, K. selliformis exposure
   induced significant changes in the expression of genes related to energy
   meta-bolism, metabolic detoxification and immune system in medaka. These
   results suggest that toxins produced by K. selliformis can be
   transferred through the food chain, and that K. selliformis can destroy
   the intestinal integrity of medaka and increase the absorption of
   toxins, leading to energy metabolism disorders in fish, affecting the
   metabolic detoxification capacity of the liver. Our finding provides
   novel insight into the toxicity of K. selliformis to marine fish.},

Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},

Abstract = {A potent and heat-stable tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found to accumulate
   in various marine bivalve species, including Pacific oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas), raising a food safety concern. While several
   studies on geographical occurrence of TTX have been conducted, there is
   a lack of knowledge about the distribution of the toxin within and
   between bivalves. We, therefore, measured TTX in the whole flesh,
   mantle, gills, labial palps, digestive gland, adductor muscle and
   intravalvular fluid of C. gigas using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. Weekly monitoring during summer months revealed the
   highest TTX concentrations in the digestive gland (up to 242 mu g/kg),
   significantly higher than in other oyster tissues. Intra-population
   variability of TTX, measured in the whole flesh of each of twenty
   animals, reached 46\% and 32\% in the two separate batches,
   respectively. In addition, an inter-population study was conducted to
   compare TTX levels at four locations within the oyster production area.
   TTX concentrations in the whole flesh varied significantly between some
   of these locations, which was unexplained by the differences in weight
   of flesh. This is the first study examining TTX distribution in C. gigas
   and the first confirmation of the preferential accumulation of TTX in
   oyster digestive gland.},

Title = {Spirolide uptake and detoxification by Crassostrea gigas exposed
   to the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {358},
Pages = {108-115},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed 4 days to cultures of the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii (strain CCMP1773) that produces
   spirolides belonging to fast acting toxins (FAT) and let depurate for 7
   days. During depuration, oysters were either fed the non-toxic algae
   Isochrysis galbana Tahitian clone (T. Iso) or starved. The objectives of
   this experiment were to evaluate (i) spirolide uptake and depuration by
   oysters (ii) spirolide effects on oysters and (iii) oyster recovery
   according to food supply during depuration.
   A. ostenfeldii cells were filtered and ingested by oysters while faeces
   contained numerous intact cells of the toxic diet. This suggested that
   ingested cells were not totally digested by oysters. Contents of
   spirolides (SPX) in digestive gland and remaining tissues during
   contamination and detoxification periods were measured by liquid
   chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Four
   different SPX analogues (13,19-didesMeC, 13-desMeC, 13-desMeD and trace
   of SPX-D) were detected. The 13,19-didesMeC-SPX dominated in both
   digestive gland and remaining tissues. After four days exposure,
   digestive gland (DG) contained 83\% of the total initial spirolide
   concentration, whereas remaining tissues contained only 17\%. During
   detoxification, spirolide content in DG was lower in fed than in unfed
   oysters but similar in remaining tissues.
   Exposure to A. ostenfeldii resulted in an inflammatory response
   consisting of hemocyte infiltration and diapedesis into the intestinal
   tract of the oysters. Percentage of active digestive tubules in oysters
   fed A. ostenfeldii was significantly lower than in control (prior
   exposition) oysters (36\% and 61\%, respectively). At the end of the
   detoxification period, there was a significant difference in the
   percentage of active digestive tubules (P<0.001) between fed and unfed
   oysters. When oysters were fed T-Iso following the A. ostenfeldii
   exposure, 80\% of digestive tubules were active, thus revealing a rapid
   recovery after toxic algae exposure.
   Overall, both spirolide detoxification and recovery from their toxic
   effects are almost complete within 7 days after exposure to spirolide
   producers. Such informationmay help to resume faster oyster sales after
   toxic events involving FAT implying thus more frequent chemical
   analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The integration of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
   Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) exhibits superior
   performance in biosensor construction. And the distinctive role of
   aptamers in target recognition has long been a focal point of research.
   Through the combination of Cas12a with cis-cleavage activity and aptamer
   with specific recognition, a simple and rapid fluorescent biosensor has
   been constructed. Interestingly, with modified fluorescent and quenching
   groups at two ends, aptamers play a dual role: primarily as the elements
   for target recognition and additionally functioning act as the
   fluorescent probe for signal output. Coupling with cis-cleavage of
   Cas12a, the demand of additional signal probes is eliminated, thus
   simplifying the reaction system and enhancing result accuracy. Taking
   okadaic acid (OA) as a representative small molecule model to evaluate
   the sensor's performance, a simple and straightforward detection method
   was established. Following this, the universality of the constructed
   fluorescent aptasensor was validated by incorporating an adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) aptamer. Consequently, the CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted
   aptasensor was demonstrated to serve as a versatile detection platform
   for small molecules in food safety and clinical diagnostics. In the
   forthcoming research endeavors, it can be further extended for
   applications in environmental analysis and various other fields.},

Abstract = {We report that a Na+-activated nonselective cation channel described
   previously in lobster olfactory neurons, in which phosphoinositide
   signaling mediates olfactory transduction, can also be activated by
   Ca2+. Ca2+ activates the channel in the presence of Na+, increasing the
   open probability of the channel with a K-1/2 of 490 nM and a Hill
   coefficient of 1.3. Ca2+ also increases the sensitivity of the channel
   to Na+. In some cells, the same channel is Ca2+ insensitive in a
   cell-specific manner. The nonspecific activator of protein phosphatases,
   protamine, applied to the intracellular face of patches containing the
   channel irreversibly eliminates the sensitivity to Ca2+. This effect can
   be blocked by okadaic acid, a nonspecific blocker of protein
   phosphatases, and restored by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A
   in the presence of MgATP. The Ca2+-sensitive form of the channel is
   predominantly expressed in the transduction zone of the cells in situ.
   These findings imply that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, and
   possibly its regulation by phosphorylation, play a role in olfactory
   transduction and help tie activation of the channel to the canonical
   phosphoinositide turnover pathway.},

Title = {Development of a three-compartment toxicokinetic model for T-2 toxin in

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Tricothecenes-2 toxin (T-2) is a major mycotoxin that is widely
   distributed in aquatic feeds and poses a huge challenge to the aquatic
   industry, but there is scant information on the toxicokinetics of T-2 in
   aquatic animals. Here, we describe the development of a
   three-compartment toxicokinetic model for the absorption, distribution,
   metabolism and elimination (ADME) of T-2 in shrimp. The three
   compartments were central (the hemolymph), slow metabolizing and fast
   metabolizing compartments to account for the varying ADME rates of T-2
   in different shrimp organs. The toxicokinetic model was solved by the
   blindfold particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the values for the
   model equation parameters were obtained by applying the experimental
   data of T-2 concentrations in shrimp. The model had a good fit with the
   experimental data. It was revealed through the model that after i.m.
   administration, T-2 was rapidly absorbed into the hemolymph and
   distributed into shrimp organs. The hepatopancreas and intestine
   belonged to the fast and muscle to the slow metabolizing compartments,
   respectively, while the hemolymph had no capacity to metabolize T-2. The
   T-2 elimination rates in the hepatopancreas and intestine were similar
   and quite high while that in the muscle was very low. The methods used
   in developing and solving the model could be used for similar
   toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic studies of other animals.},

Title = {PSP detoxification kinetics in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.
   One- and two-compartment models and the effect of some environmental
   variables},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {165-175},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins are accumulated by bivalves
   during toxic plankton blooms. In these bivalves the toxins are
   distributed into different body tissues which have varying affinities
   for them, and later these toxins are transferred by the bivalves to
   other trophic levels. After the disappearance of the toxic cells,
   shellfish remain toxic for a variable period of time, depending on the
   detoxification kinetics. We studied these kinetics in mussels Mytilus
   galloprovincialis previously exposed to a bloom of the PSP producing
   dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum. The toxin profile observed in the
   mussels was very similar to that of G, calenatum, showing that toxin
   transformations (chemical or enzymatic) had Little or no importance in
   this case. The detoxification rates at all the sampling points decreased
   progressively from ca 0.25 to 0 d(-1) following an inverse
   hyperbolic-like curve. These rates were related to different degrees to
   the environmental factors studied (salinity, temperature, and light
   transmission as a measure of seston volume, and in vivo fluorescence as
   a measure of phytoplankton concentration) and to fresh body weight
   during each sampling period (estimated by multiple regression). In
   general, detoxification rates became increasingly independent of the
   variables cited as the experiment progressed. One-and 2-compartment
   detoxification models, both with 2 variants (with fixed and variable
   detoxification rates depending on the environmental variables and body
   weight), were used to describe the detoxification kinetics observed.
   Neither of the 2 variants of the l-compartment models correctly
   described detoxification. The 2-compartment models, on the other hand,
   particularly the environmentally controlled variant, fit the observed
   detoxification kinetics very well. There was only a slight difference
   between these last 2 models, which would suggest that the actual effect
   of the environmental variables considered in the detoxification process
   is unimportant.},

   Portunus trituberculatus injected with 40 mg/kg florfenicol (FLR). The
   results showed that FLR contents in the gills and hepatopancreas were
   higher in the SIs than in the LIs. The activities of erythromycin
   N-demethylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase related to cytochrome
   oxidase P450 (CYP) were induced after FLR injection and showed a
   size-dependent pattern; however, no significant difference in
   aminopyrine N-demethylase activity was found between the LIs and SIs.
   The activity of the phase II enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST)
   increased in the hepatopancreas after FLR injection, and it was higher
   in the SIs than the LIs. Moreover, induction of CYP2, CYP3, GST, ABCB
   and ABCG was observed in the first 24 hr after FLR injection. FLR caused
   more biomolecular damage in the SIs than the LIs, displaying an obvious
   body weight- and time-dependent pattern. In summary, the SIs exhibited
   faster FLR uptake and slower depuration in this species, and FLR caused
   more biomolecular damage to the SIs.},

Abstract = {A DTX-1-producing microalga, Prorocentrum foraminosum, from Peter the
   Great Bay, Sea of Japan, was fed to Gray's mussels, Crenomytilus
   grayanus, for 12 days. An increase in DTX-1 and 7-O-acyl-DTX-1 (DTX-3)
   was observed in the digestive gland, kidneys, and gills. The digestive
   gland accumulated 91-100\% of DTX-1 + DTX-3; and kidneys and gills
   accumulated, up to 8.5\% and 4.3\%, respectively. The kidneys had a
   distinctive pattern of toxin accumulation where the concentration of
   DTX-1 did not grow significantly after the eighth day of feeding,
   indicating the potential of DTX-1 elimination. The digestive gland and
   gills predominantly accumulated DTX-1, with a dramatic increase between
   Days 8 and 12. The DTX-3 content was highest in the digestive gland. The
   composition of DTX-3 in the acyl groups was similar for the digestive
   gland and kidneys, and did not change during feeding. The total toxin
   uptake of mussels exceeded the total toxin content from ingested cells
   by 2.4 times, showing that toxins may have accumulated from the
   seawater. This assumption needs to be further proved. The muscle,
   gonads, and mantle remained free of toxins. No genotoxic effect was
   observed in the gills and digestive gland.},

Title = {Accumulation and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins by Australian

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) were detected in abalone (Haliotis
   rubra) in April 2011 in south-east Tasmania, Australia, during a
   dinoflagellate bloom of Gymnodinium catenatum. This led to restrictions
   on abalone harvesting and triggered continued PST monitoring by Ultra
   Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-FLD) of abalone and mussels
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis), and concurrent phytoplankton monitoring,
   between 2011 and 2013. PST up to 2437 lig STX mu q kg(-1) (three times
   the bivalve regulatory limit) were confirmed in abalone viscera, with
   toxicity up to 586 pg STX mu q kg(-1) in the muscular foot (mainly doSTX
   and minor proportions of SIX and doSTX). Mussels accumulated PST at a
   faster rate than abalone which suggests they can serve as sentinels of
   PST accumulation to inform abalone risk management protocols.
   Three lines of evidence for G. catenatum as the source of PST in abalone
   were established: (1) PST in abalone tissues increased and declined in
   association with dinoflagellate blooms; (2) G. catenatum DNA was
   detected by real-time PCR in abalone digestive tracts; and (3) the PST
   analogues (toxin profile) observed in both abalone viscera and mussels
   were similar suggesting a common PST source. This is the first time a
   conclusive linkage between the occurrence of PST in abalone and a
   dinoflagellate source has been demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {2008},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of marine algal toxins which have been
   found in dinoflagellates and shellfishes. In the present study the
   metabolism of pectenotoxins in brown crabs Cancer pagurus was
   investigated. The feeding experiments were carried out at Tjarno Marine
   Biological Laboratory in Sweden in September of 2006. Brown crabs, both
   male and female with all body parts intact, were collected at 15 to 25 m
   depth of the coast of Tjarno. The toxic blue mussels Mytilus edulis (
   211.4 mu g/kg PTX-2, 2,781.4 mu g/kg PTX-2 SA, 236.3 mu g/kg 7-epi-PTX-2
   SA, 138.3 mu g/kg PTX-12a and 138.7 mu g/kg PTX-12b) were sampled from
   south coast of Norway. The crabs were kept in individual cages in tanks
   with continuous pumping of deep sea water at temperatures ranging from
   10 to 12 C during the experiment. Brown crabs were fed toxic blue
   mussels for 21 days and depurated for 42 days. Toxins were extracted
   with methanol from the digestive glands of contaminated crabs,
   uncontaminated crabs ( control group) and blue mussels. Extracts of crab
   digestive glands and mussel meat were fractionated by liquid-liquid
   partitioning and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
   mass spectrometry. Comparison among the chromatograms of extracts
   revealed the presence of PTX-2, PTX-2 SA, 7-epi-PTX-2 SA, PTX-12 and a
   new PTX-like compound which was designated metabolite-1 in crabs. The
   concentrations of PTXs in the crabs were analyzed during the depuration.
   A one-compartment model was applied to describe the depuration of PTXs.
   The half-life of PTX-2, PTX-2 SA, 7-epiPTX-2 SA, PTX-12a, PTX-12b and
   metabolite-1 were estimated to be respectively 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.5, 7.5,
   7.0 days. After a 42-day depuration the amount of PTXs measured in crab
   digestive glands was less than 1 mu g/kg. The metabolite-1 in crab
   digestive glands was extracted with methanol, purified by solid phase
   extraction with silica gel 60 ( Merck) columns and analyzed by liquid
   chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry. The LC-MS2 mass
   spectrum of metabolite-1 {[}M+Na]+ ion at m/z 897.5 showed fragment ions
   at m/z 853.5 and 555.5 typical of those exhibited by other pectentoxins.
   The molecular weight of metabolite-1 was 874, the same of PTX-11. The OH
   group in the molecular of metabolite-1 was somewhere in the C16-C33
   fragment.},

Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {57},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Paralytic (PSP), diarrheic (DSP), and amnesic shellfish poisonings are
   among the most prominent foodborne diseases threatening the food
   security. Because of the absence of legal methods capable of eliminating
   these biotoxins, the option is to rely on natural detoxification,
   compromising the availability of protein-based food and imposing severe
   socioeconomic impacts. In vivo detoxification methodologies have focused
   on the use of adsorbents (mainly applied to PSP), some of which are
   combined with nontoxic algae. Alternative methodologies for DSP have
   emerged, but they are based on absorption inhibition, which may be
   unfeasible in real situations. It is thus imperative to optimize
   existing proposals or develop novel, safe, and cost-effective methods so
   that the solution is seen as an attractive financial investment.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe dinoflagellate Alexandrium monilatum forms blooms during
   summer in tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Questions persist
   about the potential for A. monilatum to negatively affect aquatic
   organisms. Its main toxin, goniodomin A (GDA), a polyketide macrolide,
   has been shown to have adverse effects on animals, for example through
   cytotoxicity and interaction with actin.MethodsEastern oysters
   Crassostrea virginica were exposed for 96 h to sublethal concentrations
   of A. monilatum (615 +/- 47 cells/mL {[}average +/- SD]; containing
   mainly intracellular GDA {[}215 +/- 7.15 pg/cell] and to a lesser extent
   goniodomin B, goniodomin C, and GDA seco-acid as quantified by liquid
   chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry) or to nontoxic
   phytoplankton or were unexposed. They were subsequently depurated for 96
   h by exposure to nontoxic phytoplankton. Clearance rates were estimated,
   and oysters were sampled daily and tissue (gill, digestive gland, and
   remaining tissues) excised for analyses by histopathology, gene
   expression quantified by quantitative PCR, and goniodomin
   quantification.ResultA positive clearance rate, no mortality, and no
   tissue pathologies were observed in oysters exposed to A. monilatum.
   Goniodomin A was detected in gill 6 h after exposure (504 +/- 329 mu
   g/kg {[}average +/- SE]) and to a lesser extent in the digestive gland
   and remaining soft tissues. In the digestive gland, a trend of
   transformation of GDA to GDA seco-acid was observed. The majority of
   toxins (>= 83\%) were depurated after 96 h. Expression of genes involved
   in oxidative response increased 14-fold after 6 h, and those involved in
   actin synthesis showed a 27-fold change after 24 h, while expression of
   apoptosis genes increased 6.9-fold after 96 h compared with the control
   (eastern oysters exposed to nontoxic phytoplankton).ConclusionExposure
   experiments (nonsublethal or chronic) should be carried out to better
   assess the threat of this species and toxins for eastern oysters and
   other marine organisms.},

Title = {Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Extraction from Bivalve Meat for Analysis
   Using Potentiometric Chemical Sensors},
Journal = {BIOSENSORS-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A simple and reliable methodology for the detection of paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) in bivalve tissues using potentiometric chemical
   sensors was developed. Five methods of PST extraction from mussel and
   oyster tissues were evaluated, including the AOAC-recommended method,
   which served as the reference. The main objective was to minimize the
   matrix effect of the extracts on the sensors' responses and ensure
   efficient toxin recovery. Extraction procedures using acetic acid with
   heating and water yielded the highest responses from the potentiometric
   chemical sensors to PSTs. The highest recovery of PSTs from bivalve
   tissues was achieved with extraction using acetic acid and heating.
   Further extract purification, which is indispensable for liquid
   chromatography with fluorometric detection (LC-FLD) analysis, was found
   to be unnecessary for analysis with chemical sensors. While water
   extraction can also be used as a rapid and simple PST extraction method,
   the lower recoveries should be considered when interpreting the results.
   Further research is needed to identify the compounds remaining in the
   extracts that cause a decrease in sensor responses and to develop
   procedures for their elimination.},

Title = {Conversion and Stability of New Metabolites of Paralytic Shellfish

Abstract = {A number of new C-11 hydroxyl metabolites (so-called M-toxins) of
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) have been discovered in contaminated
   shellfish, and trace amounts have also been detected in some strains of
   PST-producing microalgae. To investigate the chemical conversion and
   stability of M-toxins, mussel extracts were purified with solid-phase
   extraction cartridges (Oasis HLB) and Biogel P-2 resin columns and four
   partially purified M-toxin fractions were stored at different
   temperatures (-20, 4, and 20 degrees C) and pH values (3, 4, and 5). The
   concentrations and profiles of M-toxins in these fractions were analyzed
   using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for 27
   weeks. Results further confirmed the chemical conversion pathway M1 ->
   M3 -> M5 and determined for the first time two new transformation
   pathways: M2 -> M4 -> M6 and neosaxitoxin (NEO) -> M10. The half-lives
   of M1, M2, M4, and M10 were calculated using a first-order degradation
   kinetics model, which indicated that the degradation of all M-toxins was
   dependent upon the temperature and pH, increasing with rising
   temperature and pH. In comparison to M4 and M10, Ml was more sensitive
   to the temperature, followed by M2. Results suggest that M-toxins should
   be maintained at a low temperature (-20 degrees C) and low pH (3) for
   their prolonged storage. M-toxins were less stable than all of the
   common analogues of PSTs, which may be beneficial for shellfish to
   achieve rapid detoxification through transformation of PSTs to M-toxins.
   These new findings are of significance because they enable further
   understanding of the metabolism of PSTs and their detoxification
   mechanisms in contaminated shellfish.},

Title = {Selenocompounds in juvenile white sturgeon: Evaluating blood, tissue,
   and urine selenium concentrations after a single oral dose},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {158-165},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for all vertebrates,
   however, at environmental relevant levels, it is a potent toxin. In the
   San Francisco Bay-Delta, white sturgeon, an ancient Chondrostean fish of
   high ecological and economic value, is at risk to Se exposure. The
   present study is the first to examine the uptake, distribution, and
   excretion of various selenocompounds in white sturgeon. A combined
   technique of stomach intubation, dorsal aorta cannulation, and urinary
   catheterization was utilized, in this study, to characterize the
   short-term effects of Se in the forms of sodium-selenate (Selenate),
   sodium-selenite (Selenite), selenocystine (SeCys), L-selenomethionine
   (SeMet), Se-methylseleno-L-cysteine (MSeCys), and selenoyeast (SeYeast).
   An ecologically relevant dose of Se (similar to 500 mu g/kg body weight)
   was intubated into groups of 5 juvenile white sturgeon. Blood and urine
   samples were repeatedly collected over the 48 h post intubation period
   and fish were sacrificed for Se tissue concentration and distribution at
   48 h. The tissue concentration and distribution, blood concentrations,
   and urinary elimination of Se significantly differ (p <= 0.05) among
   forms. In general, organic selenocompounds maintain higher blood
   concentrations, with SeMeCys maintaining the highest area under the
   curve (66.3 +/- 8.7 and 9.3 +/- 1.0 mu g h/ml) and maximum Se
   concentration in blood (2.3 +/- 0.2 and 0.4 +/- 0.2 mu g/ml) in both the
   protein and non-protein bound fractions, respectively. Selenate,
   however, did not result in significant increase of Se concentration,
   compared with the control, in the protein-bound blood fraction.
   Regardless of source, Se is preferentially distributed into
   metabolically active tissues, with the SeMet treated fish achieving the
   highest concentration in most tissues. In contrast, Selenite has very
   similar blood concentrations and tissue distribution profile to SeCys
   and SeYeast. From blood and tissue Se concentrations, Selenate is not
   stored in blood, but taken up rapidly by the liver and white muscle.
   Urinary elimination of Se is form dependent and peaks between 3 and 12 h
   post intubation. A basic understanding of the overall Se absorption,
   distribution, and elimination is provided through monitoring tissue Se
   concentrations, however, conclusions regarding to the dynamics and the
   specific processes of Se metabolism can only be inferred, in the absence
   of kinetic information. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effects of feeding Alexandrium tamarense, a paralytic shellfish
   toxin producer, on antioxidant enzymes in scallops (Patinopecten
   yessoensis) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Contamination of molluscan bivalves with paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PST) is a frequent occurrence worldwide. Paralytic shellfish poisoning
   (PSP) events seriously threaten consumers' health and shellfish economy.
   It is worthwhile to investigate the dynamic response of antioxidant
   enzymes to PST accumulated by bivalves, since this will help us explore
   the mechanisms for accumulation and biotransformation of PST in
   shellfish. In this study, scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis) and mussels
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were fed in the laboratory with Alexandrium
   tamarense (ATHK), a PST-producing dinoflagellate. Dynamic variations of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes including
   superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and
   glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, EC 1.11.1.9) were monitored in the
   muscle and digestive gland of experimental shellfish. Results showed
   that ROS was quickly generated and then disappeared in the tissues of
   scallop and mussel in the PST-accumulating and depurating periods, and
   that different response of antioxidant enzymes to ROS occurred in the
   two different bivalves. SOD activity was obviously inhibited in the
   tissues of scallop, while the CAT activity was not stimulated by the
   toxic bait in scallop. However, both SOD and CAT activities were induced
   in the tissues of mussel to effectively scavenge superoxide anion free
   radical and H2O2. Similar dynamic fluctuation of GSH-Px activity was
   also stimulated to remove H2O2 or other superoxide compounds in the
   tissues of both bivalves, which was hypothetically modulated by the
   depletion and regeneration of glutathione. Only GSH-Px enzyme was
   induced to remove ROS in scallop, but all SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px enzymes
   were stimulated to avoid oxidative stress in mussel. The species
   specific response of antioxidant enzymes between scallop and mussel fed
   with toxic A. tamarense has been described here for the first time. (c)

Title = {Uptake and release of paralytic shellfish toxins by the clam

Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {77},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A laboratory experiment was performed with the clam Ruditapes
   decussatus, fed with the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum and
   the non-toxic algae Isochrysis galbana (14 days) and subsequently only
   with I. galbana (15 days). Individual paralytic shellfish toxins were
   determined by LC-FLD in G. catenatum cells, whole clam tissues, and
   particulate organic matter (POM) produced by clams. The toxins dcSTX and
   dcGTX2 + 3 in the algae were less abundant than C1 + 2 and B1, but were
   predominant in clams during both the exposure and depuration phases. The
   toxin dcNEO was only detected in clams during a short period, indicating
   conversion from other compounds. The toxin composition of the POM
   indicated the export of dcSTX as faeces or pseudo-faeces along the
   entire experiment (2.5-14 nmol mg(-1)) B1 was present in a short period
   of the exposure and C1 + 2 and dcGTX2 + 3 absent. A mass balance
   calculation indicated that approximately 95\% of C1 + 2 and 85\% of B1
   supplied to the clams were converted into other toxins or lost in
   solution. Conversely, the net gain of 512, 61 and 31 nmol for dcSTX,
   dcGTX2 + 3 and dcNEO, respectively, suggests the conversion from other
   assimilated compounds by clams during exposure and depuration phases.

Title = {Bioactive extracellular compounds produced by the dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium minutum are highly detrimental for oysters},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Blooms of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium spp., known as producers of
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are regularly detected on the French
   coastline. PSTs accumulate into harvested shellfish species, such as the
   Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and can cause strong disorders to
   consumers at high doses. The impacts of Alexandrium minutum on C. gigas
   have often been attributed to its production of PSTs without testing
   separately the effects of the bioactive extracellular compounds (BECs)
   with allelopathic, hemolytic, cytotoxic or ichthyotoxic properties,
   which can also be produced by these algae. The BECs, still
   uncharacterized, are excreted within the environment thereby impacting
   not only phytoplankton, zooplankton but also marine invertebrates and
   fishes, without implicating any PST. The aim of this work was to compare
   the effects of three strains of A. minutum producing either only PSTs,
   only BECs, or both PSTs and BECs, on the oyster C. gigas. Behavioral and
   physiological responses of oysters exposed during 4 days were monitored
   and showed contrasted behavioral and physiological responses in oysters
   supposedly depending on produced bioactive substances. The non-PST
   extracellular-compound-producing strain primarily strongly modified
   valve-activity behavior of C. gigas and induced hemocyte mobilization
   within the gills, whereas the PST-producing strain caused inflammatory
   responses within the digestive gland and disrupted the daily biological
   rhythm of valve activity behavior. BECs may therefore have a significant
   harmful effect on the gills, which is one of the first organ in contact
   with the extracellular substances released in the water by A. minutum.
   Conversely, the PSTs impact the digestive gland, where they are released
   and mainly accumulated, after degradation of algal cells during
   digestion process of bivalves. This study provides a better
   understanding of the toxicity of A. minutum on oyster and highlights the
   significant role of BECs in this toxicity calling for further chemical
   characterization of these substances.},

Title = {Profiles of paralytic shellfish toxins in bivalves of low and elevated
   toxicities following exposure to Gymnodinium catenatum blooms in
   Portuguese estuarine and coastal waters},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {138},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Profiles of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were examined in 405
   composite samples of Mytilus spp., Cerastoderma edule, Donax trunculus
   and Spisula solida collected between 2007 and 2012 from natural
   production areas in two estuaries (Aveiro and Mondego), two coastal
   lagoons (Obidos and Formosa), and three open coastal areas (Aguda,
   Comporta and Culatra). Toxin concentrations were obtained from the
   biotoxin monitoring programme database. Episodes of PST toxicity in
   Portugal have been associated with Gymnodinium catenatum blooms. Toxin
   profiles for each species showed no trend over the surveyed years. In
   general, profiles differ only slightly among areas, except for Obidos.
   However, toxin profiles in bivalves varied between low and elevated
   toxicities, corresponding to below and above the PST regulatory limit,
   respectively. The ratio R1 = (C1+2):B1, which were the main toxins
   produced by G. catenatum cells, decreased considerably between elevated
   and low toxicity cockles, indicating the elimination of C1+2 or
   conversion of compounds into B1. R2 = {[}(dcSTX) + (dcGTX2+3)]:{[}(C1+2)
   + (B1)], which represents the ratio of minor to major toxins in G.
   catenatum cells, increased substantially in wedge clams (D. trunculus)
   of low toxicity and less markedly in cockles (C. edule) and mussels
   (Mytihrs spp.). These differences are interpreted as the predominance of
   a biotransformation phase after exposure to the algal bloom. The toxin
   profile of surf clams (S. solida) was dominated by decarbamoyl
   compounds, reflecting intense biotransformation during exposure to
   blooms. The higher ratio R2 in low toxicity samples suggests that
   elimination of the produced decarbamoyl toxins was slower than
   biotransformation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {T-2 toxin (T-2) is a type-A trichothecene produced by Fusarium that
   causes toxicity to animals. T-2 contamination of grain-based aquatic
   feed is a concern for the industries related to edible aquatic
   crustacean species such as the shrimp industry because it can lead to
   serious food safety issues. T-2, its metabolites, and selected phase I
   (EROD, CarE) and phase II (GST, UGT, SULT) detoxification enzymes in
   hemolymph and tissues were monitored at 0, 5, 10 15, 30, 45, and 60 min
   following T-2 intramuscular administration (3 mg/kg bw) in shrimp
   (Litopenaeus vannamei). Marked increases of EROD activity in
   hepatopancreas and CarE activity in hemolymph, gill, hepatopancreas and
   intestine were observed followed by increases in phase II enzymes (GST,
   UGT, SULT) in hepatopancreas, hemolymph, intestine and gill, which
   remained elevated for an extended period. Time-dependent decrease in
   shrimp tissue T-2 concentration was observed. HT-2 increased up to 15
   min. Most other T-2 metabolites were detected but not T-2 tetraol.
   Enzyme responses on exposure to T-2 were tissue-specific and
   time-dependent. Detection results indicated that HT-2 may not be the
   only important metabolite in aquatic crustacean species. Further
   investigation into T-2 metabolite toxicity is needed to fully understand
   the food safety issues related to T-2.},

Abstract = {The accumulation and depuration of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins in the oyster of Ostrea rivularis Gould (ORG) were investigated
   in this study. Firstly, PSP toxin-accumulating in ORG were produced by
   feeding with the toxic algae Alexandrium minutum cultured in the
   laboratory. The feeding amounts were designed for three concentrations
   of 4.0 x 10(3), 8.0 x 10(3), and 1.2 X 10(4) cells/mL. After 20 day's
   feeding, the toxicity in the ORG became high levels of 28.86, 31.17, and
   38.98 MU/g, respectively. And the toxin-accumulating ORG fed only for 2
   d with 8.0 x 10(3) cells/mL which toxicity was 11.93 MU/g were selected
   for deputation experiment. In the deputation process, the ORG were fed
   with nontoxic microalgae (MA) of Chlorella spp., chitosan (CTS), and MA
   + CTS. Feeding with 8.0 x 10(3) cells/mL MA and 0.05 g/L CTS resulted in
   the largest PSP toxin reduction in the ORG. After 7 d of depuration
   feeding, the toxicity of the PSP toxin decreased from 11.93 to 3.47,
   1.40, and 0.50 MU/g, as determined by the mouse bioassay (MBA). High
   performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence detection systems
   (HPLC-FLD) was applied in the qualitative and quantitative detection of
   PSP toxins in the ORG during accumulation and depuration. Chromatograms
   of samples not containing oxidation and acidulating reagents in the
   mobile phase were used to identify unknown peaks. The HPLC results
   showed that PSP toxicity before depuration was 9.07 MU/g. After 7 d of
   depuration, feeding by CTS and MA + CTS was reduced to 1.41 and 0.12
   MU/g, respectively. The laboratory experiments showed that CTS had a
   remarkable effect on PSP removal in ORG. The toxicity and toxin profiles
   of ORG were investigated by MBA combined with post-column HPLC-FLD. The
   results of both methods supplemented each other, thereby elucidating the
   accumulation, deputation, and transformation of PSP toxins from the
   toxic algae in ORG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since 1992, a monitoring program for bivalve molluscs contaminated by
   algal toxins was established at different stations along the
   Mediterranean Moroccan shores. The monitored stations were tested every
   2 weeks. The presence of toxicity was determined using the mouse
   bioassay method. Toxin profile was carried out by HPLC/FD in selected
   contaminated tissues. According to the outcomes of this surveillance
   from 1994 to 1999, reliable information on toxicity of shellfish was
   obtained. They indicate that PSP is a recurrent toxicity in molluscs
   along the Mediterranean shore of Morocco, It has been noted a difference
   of PSP accumulation among individual shellfish. The cockle
   (Achanthocardia tuberculatum) presents toxicity throughout the year,
   while other specimens from the same area such as clam (Callista chione),
   warty venus (Venus gallina) and marine beans (Donax trunculus)
   accumulate it seasonally from January to April, after which they
   depurate the toxin. Moreover, the study of toxin profiles among
   individual shellfish was undertaken. It was found that shellfish
   presented a complex profile pointing to contamination by Gymnodinium
   catenatum. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Copepod Population-Specific Response to a Toxic Diatom Diet},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Diatoms are key phytoplankton organisms and one of the main primary
   producers in aquatic ecosystems. However, many diatom species produce a
   series of secondary metabolites, collectively termed oxylipins, that
   disrupt development in the offspring of grazers, such as copepods, that
   feed on these unicellular algae. We hypothesized that different
   populations of copepods may deal differently with the same
   oxylipin-producing diatom diet. Here we provide comparative studies of
   expression level analyses of selected genes of interest for three
   Calanus helgolandicus populations (North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and
   Mediterranean Sea) exposed to the same strain of the oxylipin-producing
   diatom Skeletonema marinoi using as control algae the flagellate
   Rhodomonas baltica. Expression levels of detoxification enzymes and
   stress proteins (e. g. glutathione S-transferase, glutathione synthase,
   superoxide dismutase, catalase, aldehyde dehydrogenases and heat shock
   proteins) and proteins involved in apoptosis regulation and cell cycle
   progression were analyzed in copepods after both 24 and 48 hours of
   feeding on the diatom or on a control diet. Strong differences occurred
   among copepod populations, with the Mediterranean population of C.
   helgolandicus being more susceptible to the toxic diet compared to the
   others. This study opens new perspectives for understanding copepod
   population-specific responses to diatom toxins and may help in
   underpinning the cellular mechanisms underlying copepod toxicity during
   diatom blooms.},

Abstract = {The fate of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins ingested by the
   copepod Acartia clausi was studied in unialgal and mixed cultures of the
   toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum and the non-toxic
   dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans. Acartia clausi fed actively on
   Alexandrium minutum, but feeding pressure diminished over time. This
   reduced feeding upon toxic phytoplankton seems to be due to behavioural
   rejection, since feeding pressure on the non-toxic dinoflagellate did
   not diminish over time. The assimilation efficiency of toxins ingested
   by copepods was 3.8\%. Some of these toxins assimilated by copepods were
   redirected to the eggs, but the daily total toxin output in the eggs was
   only 0.98\% of the daily toxins assimilated by the copepods. This small
   amount of toxins in the eggs had no effect on the fate of the toxins in
   the copepods, but did affect copepod reproductive success, since reduced
   egg hatching was observed with increasing toxin accumulation in the
   copepod tissues. The amount of toxins daily excreted in the pellets was
   only 2.26\% of the daily amount of toxins assimilated by the copepods.
   However, the detoxification rate of PSP toxins by the copepods was 0.586
   d(-1). Therefore, toxins were either transformed and excreted as other
   compounds in faecal pellets and/or were eliminated through excretion in
   dissolved form, A model showed that the copepods accumulated PSP toxins
   through dietary incorporation, but excreted them after several days.
   Copepods accumulate toxins up to a threshold without any negative effect
   on fecundity, but above this threshold, they require a higher amount of
   food to achieve the same egg production rate.},

Title = {Can Cephalopods Vomit? Hypothesis Based on a Review of Circumstantial
   Evidence and Preliminary Experimental Observations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {In representative species of all vertebrate classes, the oral ejection
   of upper digestive tract contents by vomiting or regurgitation is used
   to void food contaminated with toxins or containing indigestible
   material not voidable in the feces. Vomiting or regurgitation has been
   reported in a number of invertebrate marine species (Exaiptasia
   diaphana,Cancer productus, andPleurobranchaea californica), prompting
   consideration of whether cephalopods have this capability. This
   ``hypothesis and theory{''} paper reviews four lines of supporting
   evidence: (1) the molluskP. californicasharing some digestive tract
   morphological and innervation similarities withOctopus vulgarisis able
   to vomit or regurgitate with the mechanisms well characterized,
   providing an example of motor program switching; (2) a rationale for
   vomiting or regurgitation in cephalopods based upon the potential
   requirement to void indigestible material, which may cause damage and
   ejection of toxin contaminated food; (3) anecdotal reports (including
   from the literature) of vomiting- or regurgitation-like behavior in
   several species of cephalopod (Sepia officinalis,Sepioteuthis
   sepioidea,O. vulgaris, andEnteroctopus dofleini); and (4) anatomical and
   physiological studies indicating that ejection of gastric/crop
   contentsviathe buccal cavity is a theoretical possibility by
   retroperistalsis in the upper digestive tract (esophagus, crop, and
   stomach). We have not identified any publications refuting our
   hypothesis, so a balanced review is not possible. Overall, the evidence
   presented is circumstantial, so experiments adapting current methodology
   (e.g., research community survey,in vitrostudies of motility, and
   analysis of indigestible gut contents and feces) are described to obtain
   additional evidence to either support or refute our hypothesis. We
   recognize the possibility that further research may not support the
   hypothesis; therefore, we consider how cephalopods may protect
   themselves against ingestion of toxic food by external chemodetection
   prior to ingestion and digestive gland detoxification post-ingestion.
   Reviewing the evidence for the hypothesis has identified a number of
   gaps in knowledge of the anatomy (e.g., the presence of sphincters) and
   physiology (e.g., the fate of indigestible food residues, pH of
   digestive secretions, sensory innervation, and digestive gland
   detoxification mechanisms) of the digestive tract as well as a paucity
   of recent studies on the role of epithelial chemoreceptors in prey
   identification and food intake.},

Abstract = {Biological fouling is undesirable accumulation of various organisms on
   submerged artificial surfaces. Combating biological fouling on
   watercrafts and immersed infrastructures is an eternal pursuit since
   ancient times. Traditionally, toxins, such as arsenic, mercury and
   tributyltin, were used as antifoulants on ship hulls but they are very
   harmful to both human and environment. Therefore, worldwide ban on these
   toxins has been implemented and other toxins with relatively lower
   environmental impact were used in antifouling coatings along with copper
   compounds. Unfortunately, these materials still pose a threat to various
   marine organisms. To completely eliminate this threat, coatings with
   complete absence of toxic materials have been developed. Nevertheless,
   these coatings have their own deficiencies, for instance, foul release
   coatings cannot protect stationary objects. In the past decade, many
   articles reported that titanium dioxide (TiO2) opens up new
   possibilities for antifouling materials. This article reports the
   current development of TiO2 containing materials for antifouling
   applications.},

Title = {Feeding response and dynamic of intoxication and detoxification in two
   populations of the flat oyster Ostrea chilensis exposed to paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST)},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Juvenile oysters (Ostrea chilensis) from two populations (Quempille ` n
   estuary and Pullinque bay) were exposed to a toxic diet containing
   paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), produced by Alexandrium catenella,
   followed by a detoxification period. Feeding behaviour, toxin profile,
   dynamics of intoxication/detoxification, and survival were evaluated
   over the entire experimental period. Both populations reduced their
   feeding rates during the 30 -day exposure to the toxic diet. This
   negative effect was reversible when the diet was switched to the
   non-toxic one. Oysters from the estuary accumulated PST more rapidly
   than the population from the bay, suggesting their increased ability to
   cope with more adverse conditions. Both populations showed low
   detoxification capacity. Survival was significantly higher in oysters
   from the estuary, compared to those from the bay. Due to the increasing
   frequency and intensity of A. catenella blooms in southern Chile, it is
   necessary to better understand the responses of O. chilensis in
   different environments. This is important not only because of the
   ecological and commercial relevance of the bivalve, but also in
   consideration of expected climate change scenarios, where the new
   environmental conditions could favour the frequency and intensity of
   harmful algal bloom events.},

Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The presence of a 13-desmethyl Spirolide C isomer (Iso-13-desm SPX C) is
   very common in some infaunal mollusks in Galicia contaminated with this
   toxin. Its possible origin by biological transformation was investigated
   by incubating homogenates of the soft tissues of limpets and cockles
   spiked with 13-desmethyl Spirolide C (13-desm SPX C). The involvement of
   an enzymatic process was also tested using a raw and boiled cockle
   matrix. The enzymatic biotransformation of the parent compound into its
   isomer was observed in the two species studied, but with different
   velocities. The structural similarity between 13-desm SPX C and its
   isomer suggests that epimerization is the most likely chemical process
   involved. Detoxification of marine toxins in mollusks usually implies
   the enzymatic biotransformation of original compounds, such as
   hydroxylation, demethylation, or esterification; however, this is the
   first time that this kind of transformation between spirolides in
   mollusks has been demonstrated.},

Abstract = {More than half of pygmy sperm whales (Kogia breviceps) that strand
   exhibit signs of cardiomyopathy (CMP). Many factors may contribute to
   the development of idiopathic CMP in K. breviceps, including genetics,
   infectious agents, contaminants, biotoxins, and dietary intake (e.g.
   selenium, mercury, and pro-oxidants). This study assessed trace elements
   in K. breviceps at various stages of CMP progression using fresh frozen
   liver and heart samples collected from individuals that stranded along
   US Atlantic and Gulf coasts between 1993 and 2007. Standard addition
   calibration and collision cell inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS) were employed for total Se analysis and pyrolysis
   atomic absorption (AA) was utilized for total Hg analysis to examine if
   the Se/Hg detoxification pathway inhibits the bioavailability of Se.
   Double spike speciated isotope dilution gas chromatography ICP-MS was
   utilized to measure methyl Hg and inorganic Hg. Immunoblot detection and
   colorimetric assays were used to assess protein oxidation status. Data
   collected on trace elements, selenoproteins, and oxidative status were
   evaluated in the context of animal life history and other complementary
   histological information to gain insight into the biochemical pathways
   contributing to the development of CMP in K. breviceps. Cardiomyopathy
   was only observed in adult pygmy sperm whales, predominantly in male
   animals. Both Hg:Se molar ratios and overall protein oxidation were
   greater in males than females and increased with progression of CMP.

Abstract = {Aquatic microbes produce diverse secondary metabolites with interesting
   biological activities. Cytotoxic metabolites have the potential to
   become lead compounds or drugs for cancer treatment. Many cytotoxic
   compounds, however, show undesirable toxicity at higher concentrations.
   Such undesirable activity may be reduced or eliminated by using lower
   doses of the cytotoxic compound in combination with another compound
   that modulates its activity. Here, we have examined the cytotoxicity of
   four microbial metabolites {[}ethyl N-(2-phenethyl) carbamate (NP-1),
   Euglenophycin, Anabaenopeptin, and Glycolipid 652] using three in vitro
   cell lines {[}human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), mouse neuroblastoma
   cells (N2a), and rat pituitary epithelial cells (GH4C1)]. The compounds
   showed variable cytotoxicity, with Euglenophycin displaying specificity
   for N2a cells. We have also examined the modulatory power of NP-1 on the
   cytotoxicity of the other three compounds and found that at a
   permissible concentration (125 mu g/mL), NP-1 sensitized N2a and MCF-7
   cells to Euglenophycin and Glycolipid 652 induced cytotoxicity.},

Title = {Transcriptomic analysis reveals the genes involved in tetrodotoxin (TTX)
   accumulation, translocation, and detoxification in the pufferfish
   Takifugu rubripes},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent marine neurotoxin that exists in a
   variety of aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Pufferfish in different
   habitats show great variation in their TTX contents. Exploring the genes
   involved in TTX metabolism could contribute to our understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms underlying TTX accumulation, translocation, and
   detoxification in pufferfish. In this study, transcriptomic analysis was
   used to identify the functional genes related to TTX metabolism in the
   blood, liver, and muscle of the toxic and non-toxic tiger puffer
   (Takifugu rubripes). A total of 6101 differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) were obtained after transcriptomic analysis; of these, 2401 were
   identified in the blood, 2262 in the liver, and 1438 in the muscle.
   After enrichment analysis, fourteen genes encoding glutathione
   S-transferases (GSTs), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxins
   (TXNs), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs),
   apolipoproteins (APOs), inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP), and
   solute carrier (SLC), which are mainly antioxidant enzymes, membrane
   transporters, or anti-apoptotic factors, were revealed in the blood.
   Thirty-six genes encoding SLCs, ABCs, long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligases
   (ACSLs), interleukin 6 cytokine family signal transducer (IL6ST),
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) were
   involved in transmembrane transporter activity and innate immune
   response. Notably, a large number of slc genes were found to play
   critical and diverse roles in TTX accumulation and translocation in the
   liver of T. rubripes. Nine genes from the slc, hsp70, complement C5
   (c5), acsl, er, and serpin peptidase inhibitor (serpin) gene families
   were found to participate in the regulation of protein processing and
   anti-apoptosis. These results reflect the diverse functions of genes
   closely related to TTX accumulation, translocation, and detoxification
   in T. rubripes.},

Title = {Hepatorenal Toxicity after 7-Day Oral Administration of Low-Dose
   Tetrodotoxin and Its Distribution in the Main Tissues in Mice},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly toxic compound detected in various edible
   marine animals even in European waters. To characterize the hazard by
   oral exposure to TTX, its tissue distribution was evaluated after single
   (75 \& mu;g/kg) or 7-day (25-125 \& mu;g/kg) oral administration in
   mice. Moreover, TTX liver and renal toxicity was evaluated after 7-day
   oral administration. The elimination cycle of a single oral dose of TTX
   (75 \& mu;g/kg) was found to be approximately 168 h (7 days). Daily oral
   administration of TTX at doses of 25, 75, and 125 \& mu;g/kg for 7
   consecutive days revealed dose-dependent toxic effects on the liver and
   kidney. Histopathological examination showed increased inflammatory cell
   infiltration in the liver and kidney with higher TTX doses, along with
   disorganization of the hepatic cord and renal tubular cell arrangement.
   The study results indicated that TTX had more hepatotoxicity than
   nephrotoxicity in mice. These findings provide insights into the
   unintentional ingestion of a low dose of TTX in mammals, including
   humans, and emphasize the importance of food safety.},

Title = {Toxin Profile of Two Gymnodinium catenatum Strains from Iberian
   Coastal Waters},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Gymnodinium catenatum has been the main species responsible for
   paralytic shellfish poisoning events along the Portuguese coast (Iberian
   Peninsula), causing bans on bivalve harvesting that result in huge
   economic losses. This work presents the characterization of two novel
   isolates of G. catenatum regarding their growth and toxin profiles.
   Laboratory growth experiments revealed that, although low growth rates
   were obtained during cultivation, the cell yields were high compared to
   those reported in the literature. Evaluation of the toxin profiles, by
   HPLC-FLD, essentially confirmed the typical composition of toxins of
   this regional population (Iberian Peninsula), namely, the absence or low
   representation of the toxins dcNEO, GTX1,4 and NEO and a higher ratio of
   the toxins C1,2, GTX6 and GTX5. However, the percentage of the
   identified toxins varied among the strains of this study (under the same
   isolation, growth, and analysis conditions), and also differed from that
   of other strains described in the literature. Interestingly, we found a
   comparatively high abundance of dcSTX in both strains, relative to the
   other toxins, and an unquantifiable amount of C3,4 toxins. In addition
   to the geographic relationship between toxin profiles, chemical
   conversions among toxins may explain some differences encountered in the
   toxin profiles of G. catenatum strains.},

Abstract = {The property perhaps most frequently associated with fluorinated
   polymers is their ability to prevent or limit adhesive bonding to
   themselves. This property forms the basis for such commercial and
   industrial applications as nonstick cooking utensils, finishes for
   carpets, clothing and leather goods, prosthetic devices and surgical
   implants, magnetic recording material, and surface coatings for
   industrial, architectural, automotive and marine use. This work
   concentrates on coatings which resist strong bonds to marine organisms
   and discourage the attachment of marine growth to the hull of a ship.
   The aim is to develop a coating that weakens or eliminates the adhesive
   bond between fouling organisms and the coating. Then the fouling would
   be dislodged by relatively weak mechanical forces such as the weight of
   the fouling or the sheer as the ship moves through the water. The
   intention is to avoid toxins such as heavy metals which may accumulate
   in the environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1595-1606},

Abstract = {Blooms of Lyngbya majuscula have been reported with increasing frequency
   and severity in the last decade in Moreton Bay, Australia. A number of
   grazers have been observed feeding upon this toxic cyanobacterium.
   Differences in sequestration of toxic compounds from L. majuscula were
   investigated in two anaspideans, Stylocheilus striatus, Bursatella
   leachii, and the cephalaspidean Diniatys dentifer. Species fed a
   monospecific diet of L. majuscula had different toxin distribution in
   their tissues and excretions. A high concentration of lyngbyatoxin-a was
   observed in the body of S. striatus (3.94 mg/kg(-1)) compared to bodily
   secretions (ink 0.12 mg/kg- 1; fecal matter 0.56 mg/kg(-1); eggs 0.05
   mg/kg(-1)). In contrast, B. leachii secreted greater concentrations of
   lyngbyatoxin-a (ink 5.41 mg/kg(-1); fecal matter 6.71 mg/kg(-1)) than
   that stored in the body (2.24 mg/kg(-1)). The major internal repository
   of lyngbyatoxin-a and debromoaplysiatoxin was the digestive gland for
   both S. striatus (6.31 +/- 0.31 mg/kg(-1)) and B. leachii (156.39 +/-
   46.92 mg/kg(-1)). D. dentifer showed high variability in the
   distribution of sequestered compounds. Lyngbyatoxin-a was detected in
   the digestive gland (3.56 +/- 3.56 mg/kg(-1)) but not in the head and
   foot, while debromoaplysiatoxin was detected in the head and foot
   (133.73 +/- 129.82 mg/kg(-1)) but not in the digestive gland. The
   concentrations of sequestered secondary metabolites in these animals did
   not correspond to the concentrations found in L. majuscula used as food
   for these experiments, suggesting it may have been from previous dietary
   exposure. Trophic transfer of debromoaplysiatoxin from L. majuscula into
   S. striatus is well established; however, a lack of knowledge exists for
   other grazers. The high levels of secondary metabolites observed in both
   the anaspidean and the cephalapsidean species suggest that these toxins
   may bioaccumulate through marine food chains.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are naturally occurring algal toxins in the aquatic
   environment and pose a serious threat to the ecosystem. In general,
   aquatic populations are structured by organisms of different ages, with
   varying degrees of biochemical and physiological responses. In this
   study, juvenile and adult marine mysids (Neomysis awatschensis) were
   exposed to MC-Leucine Arginine (MC-LR) (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g L-1) for 7
   days, and the bioconcentration dynamics and responses of antioxidant
   defense system were measured during the exposure and additional
   depuration periods (7 days). MC-LR bioconcentrated in a dose dependent
   manner, from a threshold concentration of 1 mu g L-1 in both stages, and
   the levels reduced gradually during the depuration phase,
   Bioconcentration patterns of MC-LR were highly age-specific, as juvenile
   mysids showed peaks during the exposure period, whereas adults exhibited
   a peak on the first day of depuration. After exposure to 10 mu g L-1
   concentration, elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione
   (GSH) were observed during the late (days 5 and 7) exposure and early
   (days 1 and 3) depuration periods in juvenile mysids, while adult mysids
   showed a peak on day 7 of the exposure period. Age -specific responses
   were also observed in the enzymatic activities of glutathione
   S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). Juvenile
   mysids showed a significant elevation in all enzymatic activities during
   the exposure and/or depuration phase upon exposure to 10 mu g L-1 MC-LR,
   but only CAT and SOD enzymes showed significant changes during the
   exposure and/or depuration periods in adults. Overall, our results
   indicate the bioconcentration potential of MC-LR and its threshold in
   the marine mysid, in addition to age -specific MC-LR dynamics and
   subsequent biochemical responses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are widely distributed in shellfish
   along the coast of China, causing a serious threat to consumer health;
   however, there is still a lack of large-scale systematic investigations
   and risk assessments. Herein, 641 shellfish samples were collected from
   March to November 2020, and the PSTs' toxicity was detected via liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the contamination
   status and potential dietary risks of PSTs were discussed. PSTs were
   detected in 241 shellfish samples with a detection rate of 37.60\%. The
   average PST toxicities in mussels and ark shells were considerably
   higher than those in other shellfish. The PSTs mainly included
   N-sulfonylcarbamoyl toxins (class C) and carbamoyl toxins (class GTX),
   and the highest PST toxicity was 546.09 mu g STX eq. kg(-1). The PST
   toxicity in spring was significantly higher than those in summer and
   autumn (p < 0.05). Hebei Province had the highest average PST toxicity
   in spring. An acute exposure assessment showed that consumers in Hebei
   Province had a higher dietary risk, with mussels posing a significantly
   higher dietary risk to consumers. This research provides reference for
   the green and sustainable development of the shellfish industry and the
   establishment of a shellfish toxin prevention and control system.},

Title = {Ontogenetic development of metabolic and detoxification genes in
   Seriola rivoliana larvae},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY MECHANISMS AND METHODS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 16},
Abstract = {The early larval stages in marine organisms have evolved to possess a
   genomic response ensuring survival and protection against environmental
   stressors, defined as the `chemical defensome'. The larval fish
   defensome consists of genes transcribed and upregulated after hatching
   to form detoxification proteins, catalyzing enzymes, transporters,
   transcription factors, and antioxidant proteins. Therefore, we aimed to
   analyze the timing of transcription and upregulation of metabolic,
   protective and detoxification genes during the ontogenetic development
   in Seriola rivoliana larvae up to the onset of exogenous feeding. Larvae
   samples from each experimental replicate were taken after hatching (day
   zero), day one (24 h post-hatching), day two (48 h post-hatching), day
   three (72 h post-hatching), and day four (96 h post-hatching). We used
   RNA-seq followed by gene annotation to identify these genes and to
   evaluate differential gene expression. From day one after hatching,
   results showed the upregulation of cytochrome P450 and other genes that
   coded for enzymes capable of bio-transform xenobiotic compounds such as
   reductases, hydrolases, transferases and dehydrogenases. Additionally, a
   set of genes of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters
   became upregulated for cholesterol homeostasis and many others involved
   in detoxification and multidrug resistance of xenobiotics. We also
   analyzed genes involved in stress-responses (transcription factors) and
   genes that code for antioxidants proteins. However, none of them showed
   differential expression. Our study suggests an orchestrated and
   organized ontogenetic sequential upregulation of the defensome as a
   natural process to adapt to the environment, the regulation process of
   macronutrients, and a defensive metabolic response in case of
   encountering harmful xenobiotic compounds or toxins in food and water at
   the onset of exogenous feeding, which contributes to the understanding
   of the chemical defensome in early marine larval development.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {178-186},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are an important problem worldwide.
   Cyanobacteria may negatively impact young-of-the-year (YOY) fish
   directly (toxin production, turbidity, decrease in water quality) or
   indirectly (trophic toxin transfer, changes in prey species
   composition). Here we test whether there are any differences in
   cyanobacterial tolerance between four geographically distinct
   populations of European perch (Perca fluviatilis). We show that P.
   fluviatilis may develop tolerance against cyanobacteria demonstrated by
   the ability of individuals from a marine site (exposed to annual
   cyanobacterial blooms) to increase their detoxification more than
   individuals from an oligotrophic site (rarely exposed to cyanobacteria).
   Our results also revealed significant interaction effects between
   genotypes within a population and response to cyanobacterial exposure in
   terms of absolute growth and detoxification activity. This genotype by
   treatment interaction may result in local adaptations to cyanobacterial
   exposure in P. fluviatilis. Hence, the sensitivity against
   cyanobacterial exposure may differ between within species populations
   increasing the importance of local management of fish populations. (C)

Title = {Ultrastructural evidence of detoxification in the alimentary canal of
   Urechis caupo},
Journal = {INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {117},
Number = {4},
Pages = {307-317},
Abstract = {The marine worm Urechis caupo exhibits specialized secondary lysosomes
   termed sulfide-oxidizing bodies throughout the epithelial tissues of the
   alimentary canal which appear to concentrate environmental toxins such
   as aluminum, silica and sulfur, as revealed by X-ray microanalysis.
   Ultrastructural examination of the alimentary tract of U. caupo reveals
   a digestive tube consisting of an inner layer of epithelium Lining the
   central lumen, a layer of connective tissue with embedded muscle fibers,
   and a peritoneal covering. The thickness, ciliation and morphology of
   the innermost epithelium show regional variation that correlate with
   functional specialization, and the main cell types are ciliated,
   microvillate, and mucus- and enzyme-secreting cells. In the anterior
   part of alimentary canal (esophagus, gizzard, and stomach), the
   epithelium is almost entirely composed of ciliated and mucus cells,
   serving to move particulate matter and fluids, and the gizzard
   epithelial morphology reflects comminution of food particles. Zn the
   midgut, the epithelium is composed of microvillate and enzyme-secreting
   cells, suggesting involvement in digestive and absorptive functions. The
   hindgut, which acts as a water lung and is devoid of any digestive
   function, is Lined by microvillate cells involved in gaseous exchange.
   The epithelium of the body wall and hindgut have been previously
   reported to contain numerous sulfide-oxidizing bodies, similar in
   ultrastructure and elemental composition to those of the alimentary
   canal described here (Menon \& Arp 1992; 1993). These unusual
   organelles, which form a peripheral defense on all exposed surfaces of
   the worm, are part of an extensive suite of sulfide detoxification and
   tolerance mechanisms which enable the worm to flourish in a sulfide-rich
   environment.},

Abstract = {A simple system was used to simulate the effect of alternating toxic
   (paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins) and non-toxic microalgal diets on
   oyster feeding behaviors and rates of toxin accumulation. These
   experimental conditions were meant to reflect, to some extent, the
   incoming and outgoing fluxes of toxic algae observed at the mouth of the
   Penze estuary (Northern Brittany, France). Physiological and
   toxicological parameters were estimated based oil fluorescence
   measurements recorded continuously at the outlet of each experimental
   tank, which contained a single oyster. Q(tox), this variable describes
   toxin uptake in oysters, it was used (instead of the toxin ingestion
   rate): i) in simple graphical analyses, ii) as well as in one- and
   two-compartment models. Results Show that toxin Uptake varies widely
   from one individual to another and is not proportional to the
   concentration of toxic algae in sea water. A one-compartment model with
   individual fluorescence recordings as ``input{''} data gave questionable
   results, however, a two-compartment model was found to effectively
   describe coil lamination kinetics ill oysters. Limitations of this model

Title = {The fine structure of the excretory and venous systems of the

Abstract = {The fine structure and function of the excretory system and associated
   veins of the muricid Nucella lapillus have been studied and compared
   with those of the buccinid Buccinum undatum. It is argued that in both
   species the nephridial gland vein is a functional unit with the auricle
   as it is in Littorina, and that its sinuses provide a compensation sac
   for blood displaced from the mantle skirt on retraction of the snail
   into the mantle cavity. This may be typical of marine caenogastropods.
   The epithelium lining the tubules of the gland recaptures organic
   solutes from the urine at the start of the systemic circulation, and
   phagocytes in its sinuses (the blood gland) abstract macromolecules and
   toxins from the blood. The development of two different types of folds
   on the dorsal wall of the kidney in neogastropods and other carnivorous
   neotaenioglossans is correlated with adaptations of the foregut to diet
   and with feeding mechanisms in which a retractile proboscis is
   accommodated in the cephalic haemocoel. It does not necessarily reflect
   phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of the observations reported
   here it is concluded that the dorsal afferent renal vein and secondary
   folds of the kidney act primarily as a compensation sac for blood
   displaced from the cephalopedal haemocoel during retraction of the
   proboscis, or when the snail withdraws into its shell. Aggregates of
   haemocyanin form in these blood spaces at such times. The relationship
   between the two sets of folds, which interdigitate in pycnonephridians
   or are largely separate in meronephridians, is related to shell shape,
   proboscis type and foregut structure in different families. Loss of the
   anal gland in the buccinoideans is correlated with changes in the
   efferent renal veins, a reduction in the size of the rectal sinus and
   the reduction or loss of the gland of Leiblein. Extracellular bacteria
   occur in the anal gland of the muricid Ocenebra erinacea similar to
   those previously reported in Nucella, suggesting that their presence may
   be typically associated with the gland in the Ocenebrinae and possibly
   other muricids.},

Abstract = {From June 2006 to January 2007 passive samplers (solid phase adsorbing
   toxin tracking, SPATT) were tested as a monitoring tool with weekly
   monitoring of phytoplankton and toxin content (liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS) in picked cells of Dinophysis
   and plankton concentrates. Successive blooms of Dinophysis acuminata, D.
   acuta and D. caudata in 2006 caused a long mussel harvesting closure
   (4.5 months) in the Galician Rias (NW Spain) and a record (up to 9246
   ng.g resin-week(-1)) accumulation of toxins in SPATT discs. Best fit of
   a toxin accumulation model was between toxin accumulation in SPATT and
   the product of cell densities by a constant value, for each species of
   Dinophysis, of toxin content (average) in picked cells. Detection of
   Dinophysis populations provided earlier warning of oncoming diarrhetic
   shellfish poisoning (DSP) outbreaks than the SPATT, which at times
   overestimated the expected toxin levels in shellfish because: (i) SPATT
   accumulated toxins did not include biotransformation and depuration loss
   terms and (ii) accumulation of toxins not available to mussels continued
   for weeks after Dinophysis cells were undetectable and mussels were
   toxin-free. SPATT may be a valuable environmental monitoring and
   research tool for toxin dynamics, in particular in areas with no
   aquaculture, but does not provide a practical gain for early warning of
   DSP outbreaks.},

Abstract = {Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has caused sharp
   declines in aquaculture industries of whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei
   in Asia and the Americas since 2010. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V
   campbellii, V owensii, and V punensis have been proved to cause AHPND.
   However, the mechanisms underlying the burgeoning number of Vibrio
   species that cause AHPND is not known. All of AHPND-causing Vibrio
   bacteria (V-AHPND) harbor a highly homologous plasmid (designated as
   pVA1-type) carrying pirAB(vp) toxin genes. In this study, we demonstrate
   conclusively that the pVA1-type plasmid can be transferred from V-AHPND
   to non-pathogenic bacteria. We constructed a pVPGX1 -Cm-r plasmid (a
   pVA1-type plasmid) by adding a chloramphenicol resistance gene as a
   marker in a donor AHPND-causing V parahaemolyticus 20130629002S01
   (Vp2S01). Horizontal transfer of this plasmid was successfully performed
   from the AHPND-Vp2S01 to a non-pathogenic strain of V campbellii at the
   transfer efficiency of 2.6 x 10(-8) transconjugant/recipient, and DNase
   I treatment did not eliminate the transfer. The recipient V campbellii
   acquired the pVA1-type plasmid and was shown to produce pirAB(vp) RNA
   and proteins. Challenge studies using the transconjugant caused 100\%
   mortality in exposed groups of P. vannamei. The challenged shrimp,
   infected with the transconjugant bacteria, showed typical gross signs
   and histological lesions of AHPND. These results demonstrated the
   conjugative transfer of an AHPND pVA1-type plasmid. It provides timely
   information for explaining the increased species of AHPND-causing Vibrio
   bacteria and will be useful in the development of management strategies
   leading to the prevention and control of AHPND.},

Abstract = {The detoxification of toxic substances is of general relevance in all
   biological systems. The plethora of exogenous xenobiotic compounds and
   endogenous toxic metabolic products explains the evolutionary pressure
   of all organisms to develop molecular mechanisms to detoxify and excrete
   harmful substances from the body. P-glycoprotein and other members of
   the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family extrude innumerous
   chemical compounds out of cells. Their specific expression in diverse
   biological contexts cause different phenotypes: (1) multidrug resistance
   (MDR) and thus failure of cancer chemotherapy, (2) avoidance of
   accumulation of carcinogens and prevention of carcinogenesis in healthy
   tissues, (3) absorption, distribution, metabolization and excretion
   (ADME) of pharmacological drugs in human patients, (4) protection from
   environmental toxins in aquatic organisms (multi-xenobiotic resistance,
   MXR). Hence ABC-transporters may have opposing effects for organismic
   health reaching from harmful in MDR of tumors to beneficial for
   maintenance of health in MXR. While their inhibition by specific
   inhibitors may improve treatment success in oncology and avoid
   carcinogenesis, blocking of ABC-transporter-driven efflux by
   environmental pollutants leads to ecotoxicological consequences in
   marine biotopes. Poisoned seafood may enter the food-chain and cause
   intoxications in human beings. As exemplified with ABC-transporters,
   joining forces in interdisciplinary research may, therefore, be a wise
   strategy to fight problems in human medicine and environmental sciences.},

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Whether P-glycoproteins (P-gps) like those which confer multidrug
   resistance in tumor cell lines are important in adaptation to chemicals
   in natural populations of vertebrates exposed to contaminant mixtures is
   the focus of this study. P-gp expression was examined in the intertidal
   fish high cockscomb blenny (Anoplarchus purpurescens) exposed to crude
   oil or pulp mill effluent. The relationship between P-gp expression and
   cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) induction also was investigated.
   Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis revealed that levels of P-gp
   expression in the bile canaliculi were three- to five-fold greater in
   oil exposed fish than in control fish. Levels of P-gp expression were
   highly correlated with hepatic CYP1A levels previously measured in these
   fish. In fish from sites near pulp mills, P-gp expression in freshly
   caught fish did not correlate with proximity to pulp mills. However,
   hepatic P-gp expression levels in freshly caught fish were 14-fold
   higher than in fish from those sites that were depurated in clean water
   for 6 weeks. CYP1A levels were also elevated in liver of freshly caught
   as compared with depurated fish. Expression of neither CYP1A nor P-gp
   was elevated in depurated fish exposed to sediment and food from within
   the original pulp mill effluent stream. Depurated fish, which were
   injected with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist
   B-naphthoflavone (BNF) showed an expected induction of CYP1A but no
   induction of P-gp. These results suggest that in blennies, unlike CYP1A,
   P-gp expression is not regulated by the AHR pathway; although P-gp and
   CYP1A both may be induced by some compounds in petroleum and
   unidentified xenobiotics at field sites. While our data indicate that
   CYP1A and P-gp are not coordinately regulated, these proteins may play
   complementary roles in cellular detoxification. Thus the elevation of
   P-gp activity may be an important mechanism of multixenobiotic
   resistance for organisms, such as intertidal fish, which are commonly
   exposed to anthropogenic contaminants and naturally occurring toxins.

Abstract = {Marine snails of the genus Aplysia possess numerous bioactive
   substances. We have purified a 60 kDa protein, APIT (Aplysia punctata
   ink toxin), from the defensive ink of A. punctata that triggers cell
   death with profound tumor specificity. Tumor cell death induced by APIT
   is independent of apoptosis but is characterized by the rapid loss of
   metabolic activity, membrane permeabilization, and shrinkage of nuclei.
   Proteome analysis of APIT-treated tumor cells indicated a modification
   of peroxiredoxin I, a cytoplasmic peroxidase involved in the
   detoxification of peroxides. Interestingly, knockdown of peroxiredoxin I
   expression by RNA interference sensitized cells for APIT-induced cell
   death. APIT induced the death of tumor cells via the enzymatic
   production of H2O2 and catalase completely blocked APITs' activity. Our
   data suggest that H2O2 induced stress and the modulation of
   peroxiredoxins might be a promising approach for tumor therapy.},

Abstract = {Toxicities of the marine algae Alexandrium minutum and its excreted
   gonyautoxins (GTXs) to the marine crustacean Artemia salina were
   investigated. Mortality was observed for neither larvae nor adult A.
   sauna exposed to A. minutum at a density of 5000 cells/mL or 0.5 mu M
   GTX2/3. After exposure, the full transcriptome of adult A. salina was
   assembled and functionally annotated. A total of 599,286 transcripts
   were obtained, which were clustered into 515,196 unigenes. Results of
   the transcriptional effect level index revealed that direct exposure to
   the toxic algae A. minutum caused greater alterations in the
   transcriptome than did exposure to the extracellular product GTX2/3.
   Mechanisms of effects were different between exposure of A. salina to A.
   minutum cells or GTX2/3. Exposure to A. minutum modulated formation of
   the ribonucleoprotein complex and metabolism of amino acids and lipids
   in A. salina. Exposure to GTX2/3 exposure inhibited expression of genes
   related to metabolism of chitin, which might result in disruption of
   molting process or disturbed sheath morphogenesis. Overall, effects on
   transcription observed in this study represent the first report based on
   application of next generation sequencing techniques to investigate the
   transcriptomic response of A. salina exposed to an environmentally
   realistic level of A. minutum or GTX2/3. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In order to elucidate the metabolic fate of
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) in fish and to thereby facilitate
   the assessment of the risks posed by this environmental toxin, we
   determined the whole body half-life, tissue distribution and metabolism
   of {[}H-3] TCDF in rainbow, trout (Onchorynchus mykiss), treated orally.
   A whole body biphasic elimination pattern resulted in the excretion of
   60\% of the administered chemical during the first 3 days, after which a
   much slower elimination-rate (half-life = 14 days) was observed.
   Significant amounts of water-soluble metabolites were found in both bile
   and liver. Of the TCDF-derived radioactivity in bile, approximately 50\%
   represented glucuronide conjugates, predominantly
   4-hydroxy-2,3,7,8-TCDF; substantial amounts of the sulfate conjugate of
   this same metabolite were also present. Except at early time points,
   muscle contained the predominant fraction of TCDF-derived radioactivity,
   amounting to 25-65\% of the total radioactivity present in the fish.
   More than 95\% of the radioactivity present in muscle represented
   unmetabolized TCDF.},

Title = {First report of detection of microcystins in farmed mediterranean
   mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in Thermaikos gulf in Greece},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-THESSALONIKI},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Background Microcystins are emerging marine biotoxins, produced by
   potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Their presence has been reported in
   aquatic animals in Greek freshwater, while data are few in marine
   environments. Since the climate change induces eutrophication and
   harmful algal blooms in coastal marine ecosystems affecting the public
   health, further research on microcystins' presence in marine waters is
   required. The aim of this study was to examine the potential presence of
   microcystins in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in the largest farming
   areas in Thermaikos gulf, in Northern Greece, and to investigate their
   temporal and spatial distribution, adding to the knowledge of
   microcystins presence in Greek Mediterranean mussels. Results A 4-year
   microcystins' assessment was conducted from 2013 to 2016, in farmed
   Mediterranean mussels M. galloprovincialis, in five sampling areas in
   Thermaikos gulf, in northern Greece, where the 90\% of the Greek
   mussels' farming activities is located. The isolation of potentially
   toxic cyanobacteria was confirmed by molecular methods. An initial
   screening was performed with a qualitative and quantitative direct
   monoclonal (DM) ELISA and results above 1 ng g(-1) were confirmed for
   the occurrence of the most common microcystins-RR, -LR and -YR, by Ultra
   High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a high-
   resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) (Orbitrap analyzer). Microcystin-RR
   and microcystin-LR were detected, while the intensity of microcystin-YR
   was below the method detection limit. Most samples that exhibited
   concentrations above 1 ng g(-1) were detected during the warm seasons of
   the year and especially in spring. Results indicated an overestimation
   of the ELISA method, since concentrations ranged between 0.70 +/- 0.15
   ng g(-1) and 53.90 +/- 3.18 ng g(-1), while the confirmation denoted
   that the levels of microcystins were 6 to 22 times lower. Conclusions
   Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected for the first time in
   mussel M. galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in
   Central Macedonia, Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially
   toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation was observed in digestive gland,
   while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples
   with levels above 1 ng g(-1) were observed mostly during spring,
   confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of
   the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an
   overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.},

Volume = {143},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Under laboratory conditions, the scallop Chlamys nobilis and the mussel
   Perna viridis were exposed to N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C2 toxin), a
   paralytic shellfish toxin (PST), by feeding a local toxic strain of the
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (ATDP) that produced C2 toxin
   exclusively. The bivalves were subsequently depurated in the field, and
   their depuration kinetics, biotransformation and toxin distribution were
   quantified. Depuration was characterized by a rapid loss within the
   first day, followed by a secondary slower loss of toxins. In the fast
   depuration phase, scallops detoxified PSTs more quickly than the mussels
   (depuration rate constants for scallops and mussels were 1.16 day(-1)
   and 0.87 day(-1), respectively). In contrast, the mussels detoxified
   PSTs more quickly than the scallops in the slow depuration phase, and
   the calculated depuration rate constants (mean+SE) from day 2 to day 13
   were 0.063+0.009 day(-1) and 0.040+0.019 day(-1) for mussels and
   scallops, respectively. The differences in the appearances of
   gonyautoxins, GTX2 and GTX3, and their decarbamoyl derivatives, dcGTX2,
   dcGTX3 and GTX5, which are all derivatives of C2 toxin, indicated active
   and species-specific biotransformation of the algal toxins in the two
   bivalves. In both species of bivalves, the non-viscera tissue contained
   fewer toxins and lower concentrations than the viscera-containing tissue
   compartment. In scallops, very little toxin was distributed in the
   adductor muscle. In mussels, most of the PSTs were found in the
   digestive gland with significant transport of toxins into the digestive
   gland from other tissues during the course of depuration. The toxin
   profiles of scallops and mussels differed from each other and from that
   of the toxic algae fed. A significant fraction of GTX5 was detected in
   the mussels but not in the scallops. Our study demonstrates a species
   specificity in the depuration kinetics, biotransformation and tissue
   distribution of PSTs among different bivalves.},

Abstract = {The effect of an electron beam on the toxic

   involved in the phenomenon of seawater blooming known as red tides, has
   been studied. This annual disaster causes mass intoxication and death of
   marine life. Electron-beam irradiation at an absorbed dose of to 1 kGy
   leads to inactivation of more than 2/3 of the microalgae population due
   to disruption of cell walls, damage to chloroplasts, and cell
   aggregation. Radiolysis destroys paralytic toxins, including the most
   dangerous of them. Because of low doses and the ease of irradiation, the
   electron-beam treatment of water can be a promising method for the
   inactivation and detoxification of phytoplankton involved in red tides.},

Abstract = {Multixenobiotic resistance in aquatic organisms exposed to natural
   toxins or anthropogenic contaminants is a phenomenon analogous to
   multidrug resistance in mammalian tumor cell lines tolerant of
   anti-cancer drugs. Multidrug resistance is commonly due to the elevated
   expression of transmembrane P-glycoproteins (P-gp) which actively
   transport a wide variety of structurally and functionally diverse
   compounds. The purpose of this review is to place aquatic
   ecotoxicological data in context of the larger multidrug resistance
   field of study. Information on P-glycoproteins structure, mechanism of
   transport, and substrate specificity gained through traditional
   mammalian and cell culture models is examined in conjunction with recent
   work on aquatic species exposed to xenobiotics both in the field and in
   the laboratory. The physiological function of P-glycoproteins is
   explored through studies of gene knockout models and expression patterns
   in normal tissues and tumors. The effect of xenobiotic exposures on P-gp
   activity and protein titer is examined in wild and captive populations
   of aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates. Substrate overlap and evidence
   of co-expression of phase I detoxification enzymes (e.g. cytochromes
   P450) and P-gp are presented. The role of P-gp chemosensitizers as
   environmental pollutants and the ecotoxicological consequences of P-gp
   inhibition are highlighted. The overwhelming evidence suggests that
   P-glycoproteins provide aquatic organisms with resistance to a wide
   range of natural and anthropogenic toxins. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Title = {Exchange or Eliminate: The Secrets of Algal-Bacterial Relationships},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Algae and bacteria have co-occurred and coevolved in common habitats for
   hundreds of millions of years, fostering specific associations and
   interactions such as mutualism or antagonism. These interactions are
   shaped through exchanges of primary and secondary metabolites provided
   by one of the partners. Metabolites, such as N-sources or vitamins, can
   be beneficial to the partner and they may be assimilated through
   chemotaxis towards the partner producing these metabolites. Other
   metabolites, especially many natural products synthesized by bacteria,
   can act as toxins and damage or kill the partner. For instance, the
   green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii establishes a mutualistic
   partnership with a Methylobacterium, in stark contrast to its
   antagonistic relationship with the toxin producing Pseudomonas
   protegens. In other cases, as with a coccolithophore haptophyte alga and
   a Phaeobacter bacterium, the same alga and bacterium can even be subject
   to both processes, depending on the secreted bacterial and algal
   metabolites. Some bacteria also influence algal morphology by producing
   specific metabolites and micronutrients, as is observed in some
   macroalgae. This review focuses on algal-bacterial interactions with
   micro- and macroalgal models from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial
   environments and summarizes the advances in the field. It also
   highlights the effects of temperature on these interactions as it is
   presently known.},

Abstract = {Blooms of toxigenic organisms have increased in spatial and temporal
   extent due to human activities and natural forces that alter ecologic
   habitats and pollute the environment. In aquatic environments, harmful
   algal blooms pose a risk for human health, the viability of organisms,
   and the sustainability of ecosystems. The estuarine dinoflagellate,
   Pfiesteria piscicida, was discovered in the late 1980s at North Carolina
   State University as a contaminant in fish cultures. R piscicida was
   associated with fish death in laboratory aquaria, and illness among
   laboratory workers who inhaled the mist above aquaria. Both the fish and
   humans exhibited signs of toxicity. During the 1990s, large-scale
   mortality among fish and other aquatic organisms was associated with
   high concentrations of Pfiesteria sp. in estuaries on the eastern
   seaboard of North America from New York to Texas. Illness among humans
   was associated with direct exposure to estuaries and exposures to
   estuarine aerosols around the time of Pfiesteria-related fish kills.
   This review of the scientific literature on associations between
   Pfiesteria and human illness identified some of the possible mechanisms
   of action by which putative Pfiesteria toxins may have caused morbidity.
   Particular attention was given to the Pfiesteria-associated,
   human-illness syndrome known as Possible Estuary Associated Syndrome
   (PEAS). PEAS was characterized by multiple-system symptoms, deficits in
   neuropsychological tests of cognitive function, and rapid and severe
   decrements in visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), an indicator of
   neurologic function in the visual system. PEAS was diagnosed in acute
   and chronic illness cases, and was reacquired during re-exposure. Rapid
   normalization of PEAS signs and symptoms was achieved through the use of
   cholestyramine therapy. Cholestyramine, a non-absorbable polymer, has
   been used by humans to lower cholesterol levels since it was approved
   for that use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1958. When
   dissolved in water or juice and taken orally, cholestyramine binds with
   cholesterol, bile acids, and salts in the intestines, causing them to be
   eliminated rather than reabsorbed with bile during enterohepatic
   recirculation. Cholestyramine also has been reported to bind and
   eliminate a variety of toxic substances. The efficacy of cholestyramine
   therapy in treatment of PEAS supported the hypothesis that PEAS is a
   biotoxin-associated illness. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Biotic and environmental stress induces nitration and changes in
   structure and function of the sea urchin major yolk protein toposome},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The major yolk protein toposome plays crucial roles during gametogenesis
   and development of sea urchins. We previously found that nitration of
   toposome increases in the gonads of a Paracentrotus lividus population
   living in a marine protected area affected by toxic blooms of
   Ostreospsis cf. ovata, compared to control populations. This
   modification is associated with ovatoxin accumulation, high levels of
   nitric oxide in the gonads, and a remarkable impairment of progeny
   development. However, nothing is known about the
   environmental-mediated-regulation of the structure and biological
   function of toposome. Here, we characterize through wide-ranging
   biochemical and structural analyses the nitrated toposome of sea urchins
   exposed to the bloom, and subsequently detoxified. The increased number
   of nitrated tyrosines in toposome of sea urchins collected during algal
   bloom induced structural changes and improvement of the Ca2+-binding
   affinity of the protein. After 3 months' detoxification, ovatoxin was
   undetectable, and the number of nitric oxide-modified tyrosines was
   reduced. However, the nitration of specific residues was irreversible
   and occurred also in embryos treated with metals, used as a proxy of
   environmental pollutants. The structural and functional changes of
   toposome caused by nitration under adverse environmental conditions may
   be related to the defective development of sea urchins' progeny.},

Abstract = {The bloom forming marine cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena Mertens
   produces the toxic compound nodularin, The production and excretion of
   nodularin during growth were measured in a monoculture of N. spumigena
   and in a mixed culture with the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina. Most of
   the toxin produced was found intracellularly, and extracellular
   nodularin was not detected until the stationary growth phase. The
   presence of R. salina did not significantly affect the production and
   excretion of nodularin by N. spumigena. Addition of pure nodularin did
   not affect the growth of a monoculture of R. salina. Similarly, no
   allelopathic effects were found when N. spumigena was tested in mixed
   culture experiments with 6 different phytoplankton species. Instead of
   being inhibited by an allelopathic compound, the growth of the test
   algae was controlled by the pH level in the culture media and by the pH
   tolerance of each species involved. Because N. spumigena can elevate pH
   up to very high levels (10.6), it out-competed 5 of the 6 phytoplankton
   species. This suggests that the high pH tolerance of N. spumigena in
   natural environments might be important for N. spumigena in the
   competition with other phytoplankton species.},

Abstract = {Stable isotope tracers were first applied to evaluate the Microcystis
   cell assimilation efficiency of Sinanodonta bivalves, since the past
   identification method has been limited to tracking the changes of each
   chl-a, clearity, and nutrient. The toxicity profile and accumulation of
   MC-LR, -RR and -YR in different organs (foot and digestive organs) from
   the three filter-feeders (Sinanodonta woodiana, Sinanodonta arcaeformis,
   and Unio douglasiae) were assessed under the condition of toxigenic
   cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) blooms through an in situ pond
   experiment using C-13 and N-15 dual isotope tracers. Chl-a concentration
   in the manipulated pond was dramatically decreased after the beginning
   of the second day, ranging from 217.5 to 15.6 mu g.L-1. The highest
   amount of MCs was incorporated into muscle and gland tissues in U.
   douglasiae during the study period, at early 2 or 3 times higher than in
   S. woodiana and S. arcaeformis. In addition, the incorporated C-13 and
   N-15 atom \% in the U. douglasiae bivalve showed lower values than in
   other bivalves. The results demonstrate that U. douglasiae has less
   capacity to assimilate toxic cyanobacteria derived from diet. However,
   the incorporated C-13 and N-15 atom \% of S. arcaeformis showed a larger
   feeding capacity than U. douglasiae and S. woodiana. Our results
   therefore also indicate that S. arcaeformis can eliminate the toxin more
   rapidly than U. douglasiae, having a larger detoxification capacity.},

Title = {Toxicogenomic evaluation of microcystin-LR treated with ultrasonic
   irradiation},

Abstract = {Microcystins are a family of toxins produced by cyanobacteria found
   throughout the world in marine and freshwater environments. The most
   commonly encountered form of microcystin is microcystin-LR (MC-LR).
   Humans are exposed to MC-LR by drinking contaminated water. The toxin
   accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage.
   Treatment of water containing MC-LR by ultrasonic irradiation leads to
   the breakdown of the toxin. Both the parent toxin and the treated toxin
   reaction products (TTRP) were evaluated for toxic effects in mice.
   Animals were exposed to purified MC-LR or ail equivalent dose of the
   TTRP and sacrificed after 4 h or 24 h. Serum was collected and assayed
   for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as an indicator of
   hepatotoxicity. LDH activity was detected in the serum of MC-LR exposed
   mice indicative of liver damage, but not in control mice. Only a
   fraction of that activity was detectable in mice exposed to TTRP. Liver
   RNA was used for microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Individual
   animals varied in their overall genomic response to the toxin; however,
   only 20 genes showed consistent changes in expression. These include
   chaperones which may be part of a generalized stress response;
   cytochrome P450 which may be involved in metabolizing the toxin; and
   lipid dystrophy genes such as lipin-2, uridine phosphorylase and a
   homolog to tribbles, a stress-inducible gene involved in cell death. Of
   the genes that responded to the MC-LR, none showed significant changes
   in expression profile in response to TTRP. Taken together, the data
   indicate that ultrasonic irradiation of MC-LR effectively reduces
   hepatotoxicity in mice and therefore may be a useful method for
   detoxification of drinking water. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Fitness consequences for copepods feeding on a red tide dinoflagellate:
   deciphering the effects of nutritional value, toxicity, and feeding
   behavior},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Phytoplankton exhibit a diversity of morphologies, nutritional values,
   and potential chemical defenses that could affect the feeding and
   fitness of zooplankton consumers. However, how phytoplankton traits
   shape plant-herbivore interactions in the marine plankton is not as well
   understood as for terrestrial or marine macrophytes and their grazers.
   The occurrence of blooms of marine dinoflagellates such as Karenia
   brevis suggests that, for uncertain reasons, grazers are unable to
   capitalize on, or control, this phytoplankton growth-making these
   systems appealing for testing mechanisms of grazing deterrence. Using
   the sympatric copepod Acartia tonsa, we conducted a mixed diet feeding
   experiment to test whether K. brevis is beneficial, toxic, nutritionally
   inadequate, or behaviorally rejected as food relative to the palatable
   and nutritionally adequate phytoplankter Rhodomonas lens. On diets rich
   in K. brevis, copepods experienced decreased survivorship and decreased
   egg production per female, but the percentage of eggs that hatched was
   unaffected. Although copepods showed a 6-17\% preference for R. lens
   over K. brevis on some mixed diets, overall high ingestion rates
   eliminated the possibility that reduced copepod fitness was caused by
   copepods avoiding K. brevis, leaving nutritional inadequacy and toxicity
   as remaining hypotheses. Because egg production was dependent on the
   amount of R. lens consumed regardless of the amount of K. brevis eaten,
   there was no evidence that fitness costs were caused by K. brevis
   toxicity. Copepods limited to K. brevis ate 480\% as much as those fed
   only R. lens, suggesting that copepods attempted to compensate for low
   food quality with increased quantity ingested. Our results indicate that
   K. brevis is a poor food for A. tonsa, probably due to nutritional
   inadequacy rather than toxicity, which could affect bloom dynamics in
   the Gulf of Mexico where these species co-occur.},

Title = {Combined effects of warming and acidification on accumulation and

   galloprovincialis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {164},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HAB) have been increasing in frequency and
   intensity most likely due to changes on global conditions, which
   constitute a significant threat to wild shellfish and its commercial
   farming. This study evaluated the impact of increasing seawater
   temperature and acidification on the accumulation/elimination dynamics
   of HAB-toxins in shellfish. Mytilus galloprovincialis were acclimated to
   four environmental conditions simulating different climate change
   scenarios: i) current conditions, warming, iii) acidification and iv)
   interaction of warming with acidification. Once acclimated, mussels were
   exposed to the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) producing
   dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenation for 5 days and to non-toxic diet
   during the subsequent 10 days. High toxicity levels (1493 mu g STX eq.
   kg(-1)) exceeding the safety limits were determined under current
   conditions at the end of the uptake period. Significantly lower PSP
   toxicity levels were registered for warming-and acidification-acclimated
   mussels (661 and 761 mu g STX eq. kg -1 ). The combined effect of both
   warming and acidification resulted in PSP toxicity values slightly
   higher (856 mu g STX eq. kg -1 ). A rapid decrease of toxicity was
   observed in mussels at the current conditions after shifting to a
   non-toxic diet, which was not noticed under the predicted climate change
   scenarios. Variability of each PST analogue, measured throughout the
   experiment, highlighted different mechanisms are associated with changes
   of each environmental factor, although both resulting in lower toxicity.
   Warming-acclimated mussels showed lower accumulation/elimination rates,
   while acidification-acclimated mussels showed higher capability to
   accumulate toxins, but also a higher elimination rate preventing high
   toxicity levels. As different mechanisms are triggered by warming and
   acidification, their combined effect not leads to a synergism of their
   individual effects. The present work is the first assessing the combined
   effect of climate change drivers on accumulation/elimination of PSTs, in
   mussels, indicating that warming and acidification may lead to lower
   toxicity values but longer toxic episodes. PSTs are responsible for the
   food poisoning syndrome, paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in humans.
   This study can be considered as the first step to build models for
   predicting shellfish toxicity under climate change scenarios.},

Abstract = {Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were exposed to an extract made of natural
   cyanobacterial mixture containing toxic cyanobacterium Nodularia
   spumigena (70-110 mu g nodularin 1(-1), 24-h exposure followed by 144-h
   deputation period in clean water). Toxin concentration increased from
   initial 400 to 1100 mg kg(-1) after 24-h exposure, measured by liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Acetylcholinesterase activity
   (AChE), a biomarker of direct neurotoxic effects, showed inhibition
   after 12 and 24 h exposure but returned to control level during the
   deputation period. Catalase (CAT) activity, an indicator of oxidative
   stress, showed significantly elevated levels in exposed mussels but only
   72 h after the end of the exposure. No change in the activity of
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST) involved in conjugation reactions could
   be observed. A gradual yet incomplete elimination of nodularin (from
   1100 to 600 mg kg(-1)) was observed during the deputation period, and
   the tissue levels were 30\% lower in clean water after 24 h. The
   observed increase in oxidative stress indicated by elevated CAT activity
   is likely connected to detoxification reactions leading to the
   production of reactive oxygen species, including an apparent time lag in
   this specific enzymatic defence response. That no change in GST activity
   was observed suggests that this enzyme is not significantly involved in
   the detoxification process of nodularin-containing cyanobacterial
   extract in M. edulis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Metabolic Hepatic Disorders Caused by Ciguatoxins in Goldfish
   (Carassius auratus)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Ciguatoxins (CTXs) are potent neurological marine toxins
   able to cause ciguatera poisoning (CP) in humans via the food web.
   Although considered one of the most important foodborne diseases in the
   world, little is known about how CTXs are metabolized in fish, and the
   possible alteration of hepatic metabolomic linked to these toxins. To
   clarify this aspect, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were fed with C-CTX1
   enriched flesh, and their livers were analyzed by nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR). Altered concentrations of glucose, glycogen, taurine,
   alanine, and lactate were observed. Furthermore, an increase in liver
   size was noted in animals fed a toxic diet. In addition, increased
   ammonia concentrations in the aquarium with toxic feed were detected.
   These results suggest that C-CTX1 ingestion leads to changes in liver
   metabolomic, which are related to the glucose-alanine cycle. This is the
   first evidence of CTXs-mediated alterations in liver metabolomic, and a
   step to further elucidate the metabolism of these toxins within fish.
   Ciguatera poisoning (CP) is a foodborne disease known for centuries;
   however, little research has been conducted on the effects of
   ciguatoxins (CTXs) on fish metabolism. The main objective of this study
   was to assess different hepatic compounds observed in goldfish
   (Carassius auratus) fed C-CTX1 using nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR)-based metabolomics. Thirteen goldfish were treated with
   C-CTX1-enriched flesh and sampled on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. On
   day 43, two individuals, referred to as `Detox', were isolated until
   days 102 and 121 to evaluate the possible recovery after returning to a
   commercial feed. At each sampling, hepatic tissue was weighed to
   calculate the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and analyzed for the
   metabolomics study; animals fed toxic flesh showed a higher HSI, even
   greater in the `Detox' individuals. Furthermore, altered concentrations
   of alanine, lactate, taurine, glucose, and glycogen were observed in
   animals with the toxic diet. These disturbances could be related to an
   increase in ammonium ion (NH4+) production. An increase in ammonia (NH3)
   concentration in water was observed in the aquarium where the fish
   ingested toxic meat compared to the non-toxic aquarium. All these
   changes may be rationalized by the relationship between CTXs and the
   glucose-alanine cycle.},

Abstract = {Japanese scallops, Patinopecten yessoensis, were fed with the toxic
   dinoflagellate Dinophysis fortii to elucidate the relative magnitude of
   assimilation, accumulation, and metabolism of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins (DSTs) and pectenotoxins (PTXs). Three individual scallops were
   separately exposed to cultured D. fortii for four days. The average cell
   number of D. fortii assimilated by each individual scallop was 7.7 x
   10(5). Dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and their
   metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and the toxin content in individual tissues
   (digestive gland, adductor muscle, gill, gonad, mantle, and the others),
   feces and the seawater medium were quantified. Toxins were almost
   exclusively accumulated in the digestive gland with only low levels
   being detected in the gills, mantles, gonads, and adductor muscles. DTX1
   and PTX2 were the dominant toxins in the D. fortii cells fed to the
   scallops, whereas the dominant toxins detected in the digestive gland of
   scallops were PTX6 and esterified acyl-O-DTX1 (DTX3). In other tissues
   PTX2 was the dominant toxin observed. The ratio of accumulated to
   assimilated toxins was 21\%-39\% and 7\%-23\% for PTXs and DTXs
   respectively. Approximately 54\%-75\% of PTX2 and 52\%-70\% of DTX1
   assimilated by the scallops was directly excreted into the seawater
   mainly without metabolic transformation.},

Title = {Nodularin accumulation during cyanobacterial blooms and experimental
   depuration in zooplankton},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {148},
Number = {4},
Pages = {683-691},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are a common phenomenon in the Baltic Sea, and the
   hepatotoxin nodularin has been frequently detected in certain Baltic Sea
   fishes and mussels. However, there is no knowledge about the naturally
   occurring concentrations of nodularin in Baltic Sea zooplankton. The aim
   of this study was to survey the concentrations of nodularin in natural
   zooplankton assemblages, and to study the depuration of nodularin in one
   common copepod species, Eurytemora affinis, experimentally. The
   nodularin concentrations in common zooplankton species were determined
   from field-collected samples from the northern Baltic Proper in 2001 and
   2002, during cyanobacterial blooms, and the samples were analysed by
   ELISA immunoassay. Nodularin could be detected from the field-collected
   zooplankton, suggesting that during a natural bloom event toxins
   accumulate in their tissues. The concentrations were relatively low
   (0.07 +/- 0.01 mu g g(-1) ww), ranging from below detection limit to
   0.62 mu g g(-1) ww. Some variation occurred in the concentrations
   between species and years; generally concentrations were higher in 2001
   than in 2002. In the depuration experiment E. affinis copepods were fed
   with toxic Nodularia spumigena for 24 h, and their toxin contents were
   monitored for 24 h after transferring them to filtered seawater. A rapid
   decrease in nodularin concentrations occurred during the first 0.5-3 h
   after the exposure. However, after a 24-h depuration period in filtered
   seawater, nodularin could be still detected in E. affinis tissues,
   indicating that part of the accumulated nodularin, or its derivatives,
   could be transferred to planktivores.},

Title = {A deep learning-enabled portable imaging flow cytometer for
   cost-effective, high-throughput, and label-free analysis of natural
   water samples},
Journal = {LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {We report a deep learning-enabled field-portable and cost-effective
   imaging flow cytometer that automatically captures phase-contrast color
   images of the contents of a continuously flowing water sample at a
   throughput of 100 mL/h. The device is based on partially coherent
   lens-free holographic microscopy and acquires the diffraction patterns
   of flowing micro-objects inside a microfluidic channel. These
   holographic diffraction patterns are reconstructed in real time using a
   deep learning-based phase-recovery and image-reconstruction method to
   produce a color image of each micro-object without the use of external
   labeling. Motion blur is eliminated by simultaneously illuminating the
   sample with red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes that are pulsed.
   Operated by a laptop computer, this portable device measures 15.5 cm x
   15 cm x 12.5 cm, weighs 1 kg, and compared to standard imaging flow
   cytometers, it provides extreme reductions of cost, size and weight
   while also providing a high volumetric throughput over a large object
   size range. We demonstrated the capabilities of this device by measuring
   ocean samples at the Los Angeles coastline and obtaining images of its
   micro- and nanoplankton composition. Furthermore, we measured the
   concentration of a potentially toxic alga (Pseudo-nitzschia) in six
   public beaches in Los Angeles and achieved good agreement with
   measurements conducted by the California Department of Public Health.
   The cost-effectiveness, compactness, and simplicity of this
   computational platform might lead to the creation of a network of
   imaging flow cytometers for largescale and continuous monitoring of the
   ocean microbiome, including its plankton composition.},

Abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters confer resistance in
   human cancer cells as well as in pathogenic microorganisms by mediating
   the extrusion of various chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell. In
   aquatic invertebrates, the presence of ABC transporters which are
   involved in the multi-xenobiotic resistance has been demonstrated.
   However, most studies have been confined to the MDR1 subfamily. In the
   present study, we characterized the expression and localization of the
   ABC multidrug transporters including MDR1, MRP1 and BCRP subfamily in
   the Indian-rock oyster Saccostrea forskali. To our knowledge, these data
   represent one of the first reports on the orthologues of MRP1 and BCRP
   in marine invertebrates. Furthermore, the observations of (i) the
   expression of the ABC multidrug proteins in detoxifying tissues; (ii)
   the induction of these transporters upon exposure to an environmental
   organic pollutant tributyltin (TBT); and (iii) the
   concentration-dependent inhibition of rhodamine efflux by TBT imply a
   possible role of these proteins in the export of TBT. Our findings along
   with previous studies suggest that the ABC multidrug transporters act as
   a detoxifying mechanism of various toxic agents including TBT in aquatic
   organisms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal distribution of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins in shellfish from Argentine Patagonian coast},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been recorded in the Chubut Province,
   Argentina, since 1980, mainly associated with the occurrence of
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins produced by dinoflagellates
   of the genus Alexandrium. PSP events in this area impact on fisheries
   management and are also responsible for severe human intoxications by
   contaminated shellfish. Within the framework of a HAB monitoring program
   carried out at several coastal sites along the Chubut Province, we
   analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of PSP toxicity in shellfish during
   2000-2011. The highest frequency of mouse bioassays exceeding the
   regulatory limit for human consumption was detected in spring and
   summer, with average values of up to approximate to 70\% and 50\%,
   respectively. By contrast, a lower percentage of positive bioassays
   (2-8\%) or no toxicity at all was usually detected during autumn and
   winter. The most intense PSP events were usually observed between
   November and January, with values of up to 4,000 mu g STX eq 100 g(-1),
   and showed a marked interannual variability both in their magnitude and
   location. In addition, a severe PSP outbreak was recorded during autumn,
   2009, at Camarones Bay, with toxicity values of up to 14,000 mu g STX eq
   100 g(-1). The scallop Aequipecten tehuelchus showed significantly
   higher toxicity values compared to other shellfish species in SJG and
   SMG, suggesting a lower detoxification capacity. Our results contribute
   to the understanding of HABs dynamics on the Argentine Patagonian coast.},

Title = {Tetrodotoxins Secretion and Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Adaptation in

Abstract = {Nemertea is a phylum of marine worms whose members bear various toxins,
   including tetrodotoxin (TTX) and its analogues. Despite the more than 30
   years of studying TTXs in nemerteans, many questions regarding their
   functions and the mechanisms ensuring their accumulation and usage
   remain unclear. In the nemertean Kulikovia alborostrata, we studied TTX
   and 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX concentrations in body extracts and in released
   mucus, as well as various aspects of the TTX-positive-cell excretion
   system and voltage-gated sodium (Nav1) channel subtype 1 mutations
   contributing to the toxins' accumulation. For TTX detection, an
   immunohistological study with an anti-TTX antibody and HPLC-MS/MS were
   conducted. For Nav1 mutation searching, PCR amplification with specific
   primers, followed by Sanger sequencing, was used. The investigation
   revealed that, in response to an external stimulus, subepidermal
   TTX-positive cells released secretions actively to the body surface. The
   post-release toxin recovery in these cells was low for TTX and high for
   5,6,11-trideoxyTTX in captivity. According to the data obtained, there
   is low probability of the targeted usage of TTX as a repellent, and
   targeted 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX secretion by TTX-bearing nemerteans was
   suggested as a possibility. The Sanger sequencing revealed identical
   sequences of the P-loop regions of Nav1 domains I-IV in all 17 studied
   individuals. Mutations comprising amino acid substitutions, probably
   contributing to nemertean channel resistance to TTX, were shown.},

Title = {Down-regulation of iron/zinc ion transport and toxin synthesis in
   Microcystis aeruginosa exposed to 5,4′-dihydroxyflavone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {460},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Flavonoids, common natural polyphenolic compounds from plants, have been
   proposed as highly effective and safe algicides. However, the molecular
   mechanism of flavonoids inhibiting Microcystis aeruginosa remains
   unclear. This study aims in exploring the global transcriptional changes
   and molecular docking in cyanobacterial cells in response to flavonoids.
   Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 5,4 \& PRIME;-dihydroxyflavone
   (DHF) primarily affected the genes transcription of iron and zinc ion
   transport, resulting in the blockage of transport for iron (II), iron
   (III) and zinc (II), which eventually led to a decrease in intracellular
   iron and zinc content. 5,4 \& PRIME;-DHF can also interfere with iron
   and zinc transport by binding to metal ion transport-related proteins,
   leading to eliminated biological activities in M. aeruginosa. Meanwhile,
   5,4 \& PRIME;-DHF inhibit microcystin synthesis and reduce the content
   of intercellular toxin by inhibiting the transcription of mcyC and
   binding with McyC protein, implying that 5,4 \& PRIME;- DHF have
   potential to reduce the risk of microcystins in the environment.
   Moreover, iron starvation and down regulation of photosynthesis-related
   genes transcription led to the inhibition of electron transport in
   photosynthetic system. These results provide more information for the
   inhibitory mechanism of flavonoids, and the inhibition of flavonoids on
   metal ion transmembrane transport provides a new perspective for the
   development of allelochemical algicides.},

Title = {The effects of removing aflatoxin B1 and T-2 toxin by lactic

   stress},
Journal = {LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {130},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a high salt
   culture medium (fish sauce and salted fish) on the detoxification
   capacity of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L.a), L. bulgaricus (L.b), and L.
   casei (L.c). These lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were mixed with
   dried fish and fish sauce containing aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) and T-2
   toxin (T-2) and cultured at room temperature for 24 h. The toxin
   concentrations in the media were quantified using LC-MS/MS following the
   incubation. Compared with the MRS broth, the growths of L.a, L.b, and
   L.c were inhibited in the salted fish and fish sauce media. As the toxin
   concentration in the MRS broth increased, the toxin removal rates for
   L.a, L.b, and L.c increased, especially those for the mixed L.a, L.b,
   and L.c (L.abc). Moreover, the abilities of L.a, L.b, and L.c to remove
   AFB(1) in the MRS broth was significantly stronger than that for T-2,
   indicating the mycotoxin toxicity enhanced the detoxification ability of
   LAB. Unlike the MRS broth, salted fish and fish sauce can enhance the
   removal rates of T-2 for L.a, L.b, and L.c. This indicates that
   high-salt stress could promote the synthesis of a detoxification factor
   in LAB.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are the most studied toxins of cyanobacteria in
   freshwater bodies worldwide. However, they are poorly documented in
   coastal waters in several parts of the world. In this study, we
   investigated the composition of cyanobacteria and the presence of
   microcystins (MCs) in several coastal aquatic ecosystems of Nigeria.
   Direct morphological analysis revealed that members of the
   genusOscillatoriawere dominant with five species, followed
   byTrichodesmiumwith two species in Nigerian coastal waters. Oso Ibanilo
   had the highest cyanobacterial biomass (998 x 10(3)cells/L), followed by
   Rivers Ocean (156 x 10(3)cells/L). Except for the Cross River Ocean,
   cyanobacteria were present in all the investigated aquatic ecosystems.
   Ten (10) out of twenty water bodies examined had detectable levels of
   MCs. Furthermore, genomic DNA analysis for themcyE gene of microcystin
   synthetase (mcy) cluster showed identities higher than 86\% (query
   coverage > 96\%) with toxic strains of cyanobacteria in all the samples
   analyzed. Also, the sequences of samples matched those of uncultured
   cyanobacteria from recreational lakes in Southern Germany. Our findings
   indicate that the presence of toxic cyanobacteria in coastal waters of
   Nigeria is of public and environmental health concern.},

Abstract = {Tributyltin-binding proteins (TBT-bps), members of the lipocalin family,
   bind TBT in fish blood and are pre-sumed to contribute to detoxification
   of TBT. Recent studies have shown that many fish species have TBT-bp
   genes, and that these genes are induced by stresses such as exposure to
   chemicals or fish pathogenic bacteria. However, the function of TBT-bps,
   and the mechanisms of their induction and detoxification activity are
   still unclear. Here, towards elucidating the functions of TBT-bp2, we
   produced a TBT-bp2 knockout (TBT-bp2(-/-)) strain of Japanese medaka,
   Oryzias latipes, by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Gene expression of the
   mutated TBT-bp2 was reduced, and the cDNA sequencing and predicted
   protein structure suggested possible loss of function. However, the fish
   could be grown under normal conditions. Exposure of the TBT-bp2(-/-)
   strain of medaka to various stresses in future experiments is expected
   to contribute to our understanding of this novel detoxification system
   in aquatic organisms.},

Title = {Trends of natural accumulation and detoxification of paralytic shellfish
   poison in two bivalves from the Northwest Patagonian inland sea},

Abstract = {The accumulation of marine toxins in aquatic filterers is a recurrent
   event that imposes serious risks to human health and important economic
   losses. While direct monitoring of seafood toxicity will remain as a
   priority for human health protection, a better understanding of toxin
   accumulation and detoxification dynamics might allow for forecasting
   tools to design better cost-effective mitigation strategies for bivalve
   farming and fisheries. In this study we explore monitoring data to
   extract temporal trends in natural accumulation and detoxification of
   paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) for two important mytilids from the
   Northwest Patagonian inland sea: Mytilus chilensis and Aulacomya atra.
   The data were collected between 1995 and 1998 in 13 stations, during two
   Alexandrium catenella blooms. The generalized linear models approach
   applied indicated A. catenella concentration, exposure time, salinity,
   temperature and zone had significant effects upon PSP concentration
   during the accumulation phase. Time, salinity, temperature and zone had
   significant effects upon PSP concentration during the detoxification
   phase. To obtain quantitative descriptors for accumulation and
   detoxification dynamics, we construct a simplified one-box model,
   defined by two parameters: 1) the proportionality constant between A.
   catenella concentration and PSP and 2) the instantaneous PSP decay rate.
   In spite of the limited nature of available data, the proposed model
   described significantly the observed variation in accumulation and
   detoxification trends of PSP. It remains. However, an evident need to
   validate the model against independent data sets from the same area and
   to identify and quantify sources of variability, uncertainty and bias
   that may affect model parameters.},

Abstract = {Vibrio coralliilyticus is a pathogen of coral and shellfish, leading to
   devastating economic and ecological consequences worldwide. Although
   rising ocean temperatures correlate with increased V. coralliilyticus
   pathogenicity, the specific molecular mechanisms and determinants
   contributing to virulence remain poorly understood. Here, we
   systematically analyzed the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a
   contact-dependent toxin delivery apparatus, in V. coralliilyticus. We
   identified 2 omnipresent T6SSs that are activated at temperatures in
   which V. coralliilyticus becomes virulent; T6SS1 is an antibacterial
   system mediating interbacterial competition, whereas T6SS2 mediates
   anti-eukaryotic toxicity and contributes to mortality during infection
   of an aquatic model organism, Artemia salina. Using comparative
   proteomics, we identified the T6SS1 and T6SS2 toxin arsenals of 3 V.
   coralliilyticus strains with distinct disease etiologies. Remarkably,
   T6SS2 secretes at least 9 novel anti-eukaryotic toxins comprising core
   and accessory repertoires. We propose that T6SSs differently contribute
   to V. coralliilyticus's virulence: T6SS2 plays a direct role by
   targeting the host, while T6SS1 plays an indirect role by eliminating
   competitors.},

   semiplicataat three exposure dose for 28 days, and later, with
   toxin-free food until day 67. Three fish individuals from each treatment
   were sampled, and the distribution of TTX in different tissues was
   measured. The results showed that the accumulation ratio of TTX in the
   three exposure dose groups ranged from 35.76\% to 40.20\%. The
   accumulation ratio in the skin and liver was the highest amongst all
   tissues, accounting for more than 85\% of the total TTX, whereas that in
   the kidney and gallbladder was the lowest (0.11-0.78\%). Studies on the
   kinetic of TTX accumulation and elimination revealed that the skin was
   the tissue with the highest accumulation speed constant (8.06), while
   the liver, kidney, and intestinal tract showed the highest speed of TTX
   elimination. The time required for TTX reduction to reach the safety
   limit could be predicted by using standard elimination equations.
   Qualitative analysis by UPLC-MS/MS revealed the occurrence of seven TTX
   derivatives inT. obscurus; of these TTX, 5-deoxy TTX, 11-deoxy TTX,
   4,9-anhydro TTX were found in all tested tissues.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide, a common constituent of marine intertidal sediments,
   is both a potent toxin of aerobic cellular respiration and an
   electron-rich molecule used by some prokaryotic organisms as a source of
   energy, In ciliated gills from Geukensia demissa, a marine mussel from
   sulfide-rich sediments, sulfide oxidation supports cellular work,
   Evidence for this comes from measurements of ciliary beat frequency
   (f(CB)) as a measure of ATP turnover rate, the rate of gill oxygen
   consumption ((M) over dot (O2)) as a measure of ATP production rate, and
   mitochondrial cytochrome redox state as an indicator of the path of
   electron flow, Results from experiments performed in the presence and
   absence of the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor antimycin A to limit
   endogenous carbon substrate oxidation showed that exposure to sulfide
   stimulated oxygen consumption and ciliary beating, with cytochrome c
   being the dominant reduced species. These results, along with the
   resultant f(CB)/(M) over dot (O2), ratio, are qualitatively and
   quantitatively consistent with the hypothesis that electrons from
   sulfide oxidation support mitochondrial ATP production, We propose that
   Geukensia demissa gills use sulfide as a respiratory substrate when
   given the choice and thus function metabolically as facultative
   chemolithoheterotrophs. Similar conclusions could not be drawn for the
   ciliated gills from Mytilus edulis, a marine mussel from aerated
   habitats, or for the ciliated lungs from the phylogenetically distinct
   leopard frog Rana pipiens.},

Title = {Insecticide resistance in disease vectors from Mayotte: an opportunity
   for integrated vector management},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Background: Mayotte, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has been
   affected for many years by vector-borne diseases. Malaria, Bancroftian
   filariasis, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever have circulated or
   still circulate on the island. They are all transmitted by Culicidae
   mosquitoes. To limit the impact of these diseases on human health,
   vector control has been implemented for more than 60 years on Mayotte.
   In this study, we assessed the resistance levels of four major vector
   species (Anopheles gambiae, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, Aedes
   aegypti and Aedes albopictus) to two types of insecticides: i) the
   locally currently-used insecticides (organophosphates, pyrethroids) and
   ii) alternative molecules that are promising for vector control and come
   from different insecticide families (bacterial toxins or insect growth
   regulators). When some resistance was found to one of these
   insecticides, we characterized the mechanisms involved.
   Methods: Larval and adult bioassays were used to evaluate the level of
   resistance. When resistance was found, we tested for the presence of
   metabolic resistance through detoxifying enzyme activity assays, or for
   target-site mutations through molecular identification of known
   resistance alleles.
   Results: Resistance to currently-used insecticides varied greatly
   between the four vector species. While no resistance to any insecticides
   was found in the two Aedes species, bioassays confirmed multiple
   resistance in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus (temephos: similar to 20 fold and
   deltamethrin: only 10\% mortality after 24 hours). In An. gambiae,
   resistance was scarce: only a moderate resistance to temephos was found
   (similar to 5 fold). This resistance appears to be due only to
   carboxyl-esterase overexpression and not to target modification.
   Finally, and comfortingly, none of the four species showed resistance to
   any of the new insecticides.
   Conclusions: The low resistance observed in Mayotte's main disease
   vectors is particularly interesting, because it leaves a range of tools
   useable by vector control services. Together with the relative isolation
   of the island (thus limited immigration of mosquitoes), it provides us
   with a unique place to implement an integrated vector management plan,
   including all the good practices learned from previous experiences.},

Abstract = {Moored observations are used to investigate the seasonal change in
   vertical structure of the cross-shelf circulation at a midshelf location
   in the northern California Current System. A streamwise-normal
   coordinate system is employed to eliminate meander-and eddy-induced
   biases in the cross-shelf flow that are unaccounted for with an
   alternative, commonly applied approach. The resulting flow structure
   develops an organized pattern midway through the upwelling season. In
   particular, under upwelling-favorable conditions an onshore return layer
   occurs just beneath the offshore surface flow, and a third
   offshore-directed layer exists at depth that does not appear to satisfy
   Ekman dynamics (to within 9 m of the bottom). Both subsurface layers
   strengthen in time over the upwelling season. Mechanisms to explain the
   mean structure are evaluated, and it is suggested that the timing of the
   development and strengthening of both the interior onshore return flow
   and the offshore near-bottom layer are consistent with the seasonally
   changing direction and magnitude of the large-scale alongshelf sea level
   gradient. The change to a poleward sea level gradient initiates a
   seasonal relaxation of upwelled isopycnals that likely leads to the
   near-bottom flow. Late-season enhancement of the interior onshore return
   flow is related to the alongshelf surface wind stress but appears to
   form as a consequence of offshore transport in the near-bottom layer and
   the need to satisfy coastal mass balance.},

Title = {Effects of Vibrio vulnificus and Microcystis aeruginosa co-exposures on
   microplastic accumulation and depuration in the Eastern Oyster
   (Crassostrea virginica)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {359},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, and bivalves
   such as the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) can accumulate these
   particles directly from the water column. Bivalves are concurrently
   exposed to pathogenic and toxin-producing bacteria, including Vibrio
   spp. and Microcystis spp., which have been shown to adversely impact
   filtration rates. Exposure to these bacteria could thus affect oysters'
   ability to accumulate and depurate microplastics. As climate change
   creates conditions that favor Vibrio spp. and Microcystis spp. growth in
   estuaries, it is increasingly important to understand how these
   co-occurring biotic stressors influence microplastic contamination in
   bivalves. The objective of this study was to examine how co-exposures to
   Vibrio vulnificus and Microcystis aeruginosa influence microplastic
   accumulation and depuration in Eastern oysters. Oysters were exposed to
   nylon microplastics (5000 particles L- 1) and either V. vulnificus, M.
   aeruginosa, or both species (104 colony-forming units or cells mL- 1,
   respectively) and sampled over time up to 96 h. Following exposure,
   remaining oysters were allowed to depurate in clean seawater and sampled
   over time for up to 96 h. Microplastic concentrations in oysters were
   quantified and compared among treatments, and rate constants for uptake
   (ku) and depuration (kd) were calculated using nonlinear regression and
   two-compartment kinetic models. Overall, microplastic concentrations in
   oysters exposed to V. vulnificus (X = 2.885 f 0.350 (SE) particles g- 1
   w.w.) and V. vulnificus with M. aeruginosa (X = 3.089 f 0.481 particles
   g- 1 w.w.) were higher than oysters exposed to M. aeruginosa (X = 1.540
   f 0.235 particles g- 1 w.w.) and to microplastics alone (X = 1.599 f
   0.208 particles g- 1 w.w.). Characterizing microplastic accumulation and
   depuration in oysters co-exposed to these biotic stressors is an
   important first step in understanding how contaminant loads in bivalves
   can change. With this research, the efficacy of depuration for
   commonly-consumed seafood species can be estimated.},

Title = {Fungal diversity and mycotoxin contamination in dried fish products in
   Zhanjiang market, China},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dried fish are important dietary protein and income sources in
   Zhanjiang, China. Mycotoxins produced by pathogenic fungi that
   contaminate fish during processing can cause considerable hazard to
   consumer health. This study reports fungal diversity, total fungal
   counts and mycotoxin contamination of dried fish sold at the seafood
   market in Zhanjiang. Seven dried fish products (Hemibarbus maculatus,
   Pseudosciaena crocea, Lutjanus erythopterus, Thunnus thynnus,
   Scomberomorus niphonius, Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Trichiurus
   lepturus, n = 10) from seven retailers were analyzed for contaminated
   fungal species, occurrence frequency and residues analysis of four
   mycotoxins. Using potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate purification,
   morphology observation, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence
   analysis, 25 fungal strains representing 12 genera from dried fish were
   systematically isolated and identified. Three dominant genera in dried
   fish were Fusarium sp. (80.4\%), Penicillium sp. (70.7\%) and
   Aspergillus sp.(63.9\%). Other fungal genera were Neoscytalidium
   sp.(38.1\%), Cutaneotrichosporon sp. (38.1\%), Trichoderma sp.(20.3\%),
   Naganishia sp.(15.3\%), Kodamaea sp. (10.8\%), Phialemoniopsis
   sp.(9.2\%), Nigrospora sp.(7.3\%), Ceriporia sp.(6.3\%), Phellinus
   sp.(4.5\%). Aspergillus flavus contamination was the higher and ranged
   from 1.10 x 10(3) to 2.40 x 10(4) cfu/g. The mean fungal contamination
   of other fungal species in dried fish ranged from 1.07 x 10(2) to 4.58 x
   10(4) cfu/g. The total fungal counts of Fusarium sp. ranged from 1.09 x
   10(2) to 2.11 x 10(4) cfu/g, but the occurrence frequency is relatively
   high. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses
   showed that mycotoxin residues were present in 12 out of the 25 dried
   fish tested. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was the most frequently detected and
   the concentration ranged from 0.03 to 3.52 mu g/kg. T-2 toxin (T-2),
   ochratoxin A (OTA), and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentrations ranged from
   0.21 to 1.53, 0.03-2.21 and 0.71 mu g/kg respectively. High occurrence
   of fungal populations and mycotoxins in dried fish sold in the Zhanjiang
   market pose a potential threat to consumer health. It is recommended
   that in future, advanced processing methods and controlled storage
   condition need to be used to minimize and if possible eliminate fungal
   contamination during dried fish processing.},

Title = {Toxic mucus traps: A novel mechanism that mediates prey uptake in the
   mixotrophic dinoflagellate Alexandrium pseudogonyaulax},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The functional role of harmful substances (i.e. toxins) produced by
   marine planktonic algae is still, in many cases, unknown. This study
   describes a novel mechanism by which the phototrophic dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium pseudogonyaulax secretes a toxic mucus trap where prey items
   are caught and immobilized prior to ingestion. Prey cells remain
   entrapped and immobile in the mucus trap, but most stay intact, readily
   available as whole-cell prey. It is shown that food uptake by A.
   pseudogonyaulax increases its growth rate considerably even in
   nutrient-replete, high-light conditions. The increase in growth rate was
   more enhanced in light-limited treatments and A. pseudogonyaulax grew
   significantly faster when fed Heterocapsa rotunda to, than when fed
   Teleaulax acuta under both light conditions. For comparison, strains of
   Alexandrium catenella and Alexandrium minutum were studied for their
   mixotrophic capabilities. None of these strains were mixotrophic under
   the conditions provided. In addition, the toxic effects on various
   protistan targets of these Alexandrium strains as well as Alexandrium
   tamarense and Alexandrium ostenfeldii were compared to that of A.
   pseudogonyaulax. A. tamarense and A. catenella did immobilize and lyse
   target cells through substances leaked directly into the water,
   differing from all the strains of A. pseudogonyaulax studied. Results
   show that the toxic effect of A. pseudogonyaulax is nonspecific causing
   nearly 100\% immobilization of a variety of protistan targets at
   relatively low cell concentrations (500 cells ml(-1) of donor cell). A
   critical donor cell density was not required as only one A.
   pseudogonyaulax cell was able to cause immobilization of target cells.
   For the first time, the connection between excreted toxins and
   phagotrophy is evident in an Alexandrium species and this particular
   strategy has the potential to severely impact competing phytoplankton
   communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Historically, public confidence in shellfish became damaged by health
   scares of bacterial, algal toxin and viral origin. Depuration has
   largely eliminated bacterial outbreaks, other than marine vibrios, but
   viral risks are only partially reduced during normal depuration
   timescales. Water quality legislation and shellfish hygiene legislation
   have together reduced risks from shellfish consumption. Even with good
   controls, a small element of risk remains. Self-regulation by the
   industry and good management practice can achieve much. Confidence has
   also been damaged by unfounded dietary cholesterol scares. Most people
   do not significantly concentrate cholesterol from food. Only people with
   familial hypercholesterolaemia need caution. Filter feeders are low in
   cholesterol and high in plant sterols. Risks need to be balanced against
   the health benefits of shellfish in the diet, which are summarised.},

Title = {Microbial community interactions and population dynamics of an algicidal
   bacterium active against Karenia brevis (Dinophyceae)},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-293},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The population dynamics of Cytophaga strain 41-DBG2, a bacterium
   algicidal to the harmful algal bloom (HAB) dinoflagellate Karenia
   brevis, were investigated in laboratory experiments using fluorescent
   in-situ hybridization (FISH) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE). Following its introduction into non-axenic K brevis cultures at
   concentrations of 10(3) or 10(5) bacterial cells per milliliter, 41-DBG2
   increased to 10(6) cells per milliliter before initiation of its
   algicidal activity. Such threshold concentrations were not achieved when
   starting algal cell numbers were relatively low (10(3) cells per
   milliliter), suggesting that the growth of this bacterium may require
   high levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) excreted by the algae. It
   remains to be determined whether this threshold concentration is
   required to trigger an algicidal response by 41-DBG2 or, alternatively,
   is the point at which the bacterium accumulates to an effective killing
   concentration. The ambient microbial community associated with these
   algal cultures, as determined by DGGE profiles, did not change until
   after K. brevis cells were in the process of lysing, indicating a
   response to the rapid input of algal-derived organic matter. Resistance
   to algicidal attack exhibited by several K brevis clones was found to
   result from the inhibition of 41-DBG2 growth in the presence of
   currently unculturalble bacteria associated with those clones. These
   bacteria apparently prevented 41-DBG2 from reaching the threshold
   concentration required for initiation of algicidal activity. Remarkably,
   resistance and susceptibility to the algicidal activity of 41-DBG2 could
   be transferred between K. brevis clones with the exchange of their
   respective unattached bacterial communities, which included several
   dominant phylotypes belonging to the alpha-proteobacteria,
   gamma-proteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB)
   groups. We hypothesize that CFB bacteria may be successfully competing
   with 41-DBG2 (also a member of the CFB) for nutrients, thereby
   inhibiting growth of the latter and indirectly providing resistance
   against algicidal attack. We conclude that if algicidal bacteria play a
   significant role in regulating HAB dynamics, as some authors have
   inferred, bacterial community interactions are crucial factors that must
   be taken into consideration in future studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {A dynamic mathematical model is presented for the growth and Paralytic
   Shellfish Poison (PSP) content of Alexandrium fundyense. The model
   includes cellular nitrogen-cycling to enable the synthesis of toxins in
   the absence of an external nitrogen-source. PSP synthesis is promoted by
   phosphorus stress but depressed by nitrogen stress, with the model
   containing sigmoidal functions relating nitrogen and phosphorus status
   to toxin synthesis. The model was tuned simultaneously to 4 sets of
   experimental data for ammonium- and nitrate-grown cultures of A.
   fundyense that were P-replete or P-stressed, The good fit of the model,
   with a single set of control constants, to almost all data (cellular N:C
   and P:C, cellsize, chlorophyll a:carbon, toxin content, external
   nutrients) demonstrates the capabilities of mechanistic models under
   dynamic situations. The potential consequences of recycling toxin-N, or
   of not making toxins at all, were considered using the model. Loss of
   toxin from cells could be by turnover or by leakage/excretion; model
   output and experimental data sets suggest that turnover may be the fate
   in P-stressed nitrate-grown cells but not in ammonium-grown cells, From
   simulations, there appears to be no significant disadvantage in
   expending nitrogen on toxin synthesis, thus there need not be a specific
   evolutionary advantage in the process, If PSP synthesis were
   selection-neutral this could explain the significant diversity in PSP
   synthesis capabilities within the genus Alexandrium.},

Abstract = {This study tests hypotheses on the biochemical functions of geophagy in
   parrots: mechanical enhancement of digestion, acid buffering capacity,
   mineral supplementation, adsorption of dietary toxins, and
   gastrointestinal cytoprotection. Parrots showed clear preferences for
   specific soil horizons. Comparisons of preferred and nonpreferred soils
   from several sites suggest that soils have little ability to enhance
   grinding and no measurable ability to buffer gastric pH. Soils offered
   insignificant mineral supplementation since most minerals occurred at
   similar levels in samples regardless of preference, and the minerals
   were generally more plentiful in the birds' diets. Sodium was available
   in moderate levels at some sites (>1000 ppm), but was well below sodium
   detection thresholds of parrots. X-ray diffraction, cation exchange
   capacity, and in vitro adsorptive trials showed that the preferred soils
   are capable of exchanging substantial quantities of cations and are
   capable of adsorbing low-molecular-weight secondary compounds. In
   captive Amazona parrots, orally administered clay reduced the
   bioavailability of the alkaloid quinidine by roughly 60\%, demonstrating
   that in vivo adsorption of potentially toxic compounds may be a
   biologically important function of geophagy. Labeled clay remained in
   the lower gastrointestinal tract of captive parrots for >12 hr, which
   along with high adsorptive capacities, further suggests a potential role
   in protecting the gastrointestinal lining from various biological and
   chemical insults. Detoxification and cytoprotection are the most likely
   functions of geophagy for parrots and herbivores with similar ecologies.
   Given the variety of chemically defended seeds consumed by these
   herbivores, geophagy likely protects consumers from dietary toxins,
   allowing increased diet breadth and/or enhancing digestibility.},

Title = {Extracellular vesicles as viral countermeasures: dampening of
   oscillations and reduction of extinction risk},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {101},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Microbes produce extracellular vesicles (EVs, tiny membrane enclosures)
   that can transport some ``cargo{''} (signaling molecules,
   proteins/enzymes, toxins, and nucleic acids) away from themselves or to
   other cells. EVs have also been shown to adsorb virus (phage) particles
   and inhibit infection, so another potential function is to serve as
   decoys for virus infection. However, the fitness benefit has not been
   explored quantitatively. Here, three existing mathematical models are
   extended to include EVs and parameterized based on literature.
   Simulations include a number of environments (lab culture and ambient),
   conditions (equilibrium and oscillating, i.e. predator-prey cycles), and
   bacteria (including enteric Escherichia coli and marine
   Prochlorococcus). Hosts invest, on average, similar to 10\% of resources
   into EV production. The models predict that producing EVs typically
   results in relatively minor increases in average host concentration
   (average similar to 4.3\% of log concentration). However, under
   oscillating conditions, EVs can substantially dampen and, in most cases,
   completely eliminate fluctuations, thereby increasing the minimum
   concentration and reducing extinction risk. These results provide
   insights into the fitness benefit of EVs as viral countermeasures, and
   they constitute a starting point for including EVs in ecosystem models.
   Several existing mathematical microbe-virus models were extended to
   include extracellular vesicles (EVs), parameterized based on the
   literature, and used to explore the ecological role of EV production.},

Abstract = {Bacteria that are members of the Vibrio genus are ubiquitous in the
   marine environment and are part of the natural estuarine microflora.
   Several Vibrio species can accumulate in shellfish through filter
   feeding, and pose a significant threat to human health from important
   fishery resources. Little is known about the interactions of these
   microorganisms with shellfish that result in significant accumulation of
   the bacteria. Vibrio vulnificus can cause fatal septicemic infections in
   individuals who are immunocompromised or suffer from liver disease
   through consumption of raw shellfish harvested from warm water regions.
   In addition, the bacterium can cause severe necrotizing wound infections
   in otherwise healthy people who handle shellfish. Such infections impact
   the entire U.S. shellfish industry causing significant economic losses.
   Another vibrio, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, has a wider geographic
   distribution and is a significant source of shellfish-transmitted
   gastrointestinal illness in humans, with increased incidence during
   summer months. Our research is aimed at the characterization of surface
   structures called pili or fimbriae to ascertain their function in
   persistence of vibrios in oysters, as well as in human pathogenesis.
   Pili are thin (ca. 10 nm diameter) fiber-like structures that extend
   from bacterial cells and are often involved in cell to cell binding or
   attachment of a bacterium to a variety of biotic and abiotic surfaces.
   In initial studies on the role of a specific class of pili in V.
   vulnificus, designated type IV, we have demonstrated their role in
   adherence to human epithelial cells, biofilm formation, virulence in a
   mouse model, and persistence in oysters. We are currently examining the
   function of homologous pili in K parahaemolyticus. If these factors
   prove to be responsible for the bacterium's ability to colonize oyster
   tissue, they may present a unique and specific target(s) for compounds
   designed to interfere with this attachment, leading to depuration
   methods that could potentially reduce or eliminate the organisms from
   oysters.},

Title = {Pharmacokinetic and toxicological data of spirolides after oral and

Abstract = {Spirolides are a kind of marine toxins included in the cyclic imine
   toxin group and produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii.
   This study shows for the first time a complete and detailed description
   about the symptoms observed in mice when these toxins were
   intraperitoneal (i.p.) administered. It is also compared the i.p.
   toxicity of 13-desmethyl spirolide C (13-desMeC), 13,19-didesMeC
   (13,19-didesMeC) and 20-methyl spirolide G (20-Me-G) in experiments
   performed with highly purified toxins. The bioassay indicates that
   13-desMeC and 13,19-didesMeC are extremely toxic compounds which have a
   LD50 of 27.9 mu g/kg and 32.2 mu g/kg, respectively. However, when
   20-MeG was i.p administrated with dose up 63.5 mu g/kg, no deaths were
   recorded.
   In order to evaluate the oral toxicity, spirolides were administered by
   gastric intubation into mice. Then, samples of blood, urine and faeces
   were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   tandem (LC-MS/MS) technique. Spirolides appear in blood at 15 min and in
   urine after 1 h of being toxin administered. In summary, in this paper,
   it is provided new data about the toxicity, absorption, and excretion of
   spirolides in mouse. So far, little information is available on this
   item but necessary for spirolide regulation in the European Union (EU).

Abstract = {The environmental neurotoxin beta-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) may
   represent a risk for human health. BMAA accumulates in freshwater and
   marine organisms consumed by humans. However, few data are available
   about the kinetics of BMAA accumulation and detoxification in exposed
   organisms, as well as the organ distribution and the fractions in which
   BMAA is present in tissues (free, soluble bound or precipitated bound
   cellular fractions). Here, we exposed the bivalve mussel Dreissena
   polymorpha to 7.5 mu g of dissolved BMAA/mussel/3 days for 21 days,
   followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water. At 1, 3, 8, 14 and 21
   days of exposure and depuration, the hemolymph and organs (digestive
   gland, the gills, the mantle, the gonad and muscles/foot) were sampled.
   Total BMAA as well as free BMAA, soluble bound and precipitated bound
   BMAA were quantified by tandem mass spectrometry. Free and soluble bound
   BMAA spread throughout all tissues from the first day of exposure to the
   last day of depuration, without a specific target organ. However,
   precipitated bound BMAA was detected only in muscles and foot from the
   last day of exposure to day 8 of depuration, at a lower concentration
   compared to free and soluble bound BMAA. In soft tissues (digestive
   gland, gonad, gills, mantle and muscles/foot), BMAA mostly accumulated
   as a free molecule and in the soluble bound fraction, with variations
   occurring between the two fractions among tissues and over time. The
   results suggest that the assessment of bivalve contamination by BMAA may
   require the quantification of total BMAA in whole individuals when
   possible.},

Abstract = {The surf clam S. solidissima, when exposed to a northern bloom of the
   toxic dinoflagellate Gonyaulax tamarensis, concentrates paralytic
   shellfish poison (PSP) and retains it for periods of over 1 yr. The
   purpose of this investigation was to identify those tissues in which S.
   solidissima concentrates PSP and to examine the efficacy of O3 in PSP
   detoxification. Various levels of the toxin were found in every
   untreated tissue examined: the mantle and gill containing high
   concentrations (> 1600 .mu.g/100 g tissue); the visceral mass, siphon
   and foot showing less toxicity (1100 to 200 .mu.g/100 g tissue); and the
   adductor muscle yielding a level of toxin considered safe for human
   consumption (< 60 .mu.g/100 g tissue). Toxic clams exposed to ozonized
   seawater for 2 wk exhibited rapid detoxification in all tissues
   examined.},

Title = {Prevalence and intensity of pathologies induced by the toxic
   dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa circularisquama, in the
   Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {37-50},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The harmful dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa circularisquama, has been
   causing mass mortalities of bivalve molluscs in Japan, at relatively low
   cell densities. Although several studies have been conducted to
   determine the toxicity mechanisms, the specific cause of death is still
   unclear. In a previous study, in our laboratory, it was shown that H.
   circularisquama (10(3) cells ml(-1)) caused extensive cytotoxicity in
   the gills of short-neck clams, Ruditapes philippinarum. In the present
   study, Mediterranean mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were exposed to
   H. circularisquama at four cell densities (5, 50, 500, 10(3) cells
   ml(-1)), three temperatures (15, 20, and 25 degrees C), and three
   exposure durations (3, 24, and 48 h), and the pathologies in nine organs
   (gills, labial palps, mantle, hepatopancreas, stomach, intestines,
   exhalant siphon, adductor muscles, and foot) were assessed.
   Foot, adductor muscles, and exhalent siphons of mussels were not
   affected; however, 16 inflammatory (hemocytic infiltration and
   aggregation, diapedesis, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, edema, melanization,
   and firbrosis) and degenerative (thrombus, thrombosed edema, cilia
   matting and exfoliation, epithelial desquamation, atrophy, and necrosis)
   pathologies were identified in the gills, labial palps, mantle,
   hepatopancreas, stomach, and intestines. The total prevalence and total
   intensity of pathology in each individual mussel, and the prevalence and
   intensity of pathology in each organ increased significantly with
   increased cell density, exposure duration, and temperature. The
   prevalence of pathology was the highest in gills, followed by the
   prevalence in labial palps, mantle, stomach, and intestines. Pathology
   was least prevalent in the hepatopancreas. The intensity of pathology
   was the highest in the gills, followed by the labial palps and mantle,
   the stomach and intestines, and the hepatopancreas.
   This detailed quantitative histopathological study demonstrates that
   exposure to H. circularisquama induces a broad cytotoxic effect in six
   vital organs, even at low density (5 cells ml(-1)) and low temperature
   (15 degrees C), but not in muscular organs. Combining cell density,
   time, and duration of exposure, the organ most affected by the harmful
   alga was the gill, followed by the labial palps and mantle, the stomach
   and intestines, and the hepatopancreas. The results of this pathological
   analysis show that exposure to H. ciruclarisquama severely affects the
   gills, the labial palps, and mantle thereby interfering with particle
   clearance and sorting, cleansing, and respiration, but also affects the
   stomach, intestines, and hepatopancreas, altering the digestive
   processes and possibly detoxification pathways, if mussels are able to
   detoxify the toxins of H. circularisquarna. In the most severe cases,
   bivalves would most likely have died as a result of combined severe
   alterations of the vital functions, failure of tissue repair, and
   moderate to heavy hemorrhaging in both the external organs and the
   digestive organs concomitantly with light to moderate alterations in the
   detoxifying processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Palytoxin Found in Palythoa sp Zoanthids (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia)
   Sold in the Home Aquarium Trade},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Zoanthids (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia) are colonial anemones that contain
   one of the deadliest toxins ever discovered, palytoxin (LD50 in mice 300
   ng/kg), but it is generally believed that highly toxic species are not
   sold in the home aquarium trade. We previously showed that an
   unintentionally introduced zoanthid in a home aquarium contained high
   concentrations of palytoxin and was likely responsible for a severe
   respiratory reaction when an individual attempted to eliminate the
   contaminant colonies using boiling water. To assess the availability and
   potential exposure of palytoxin to marine aquarium hobbyists, we
   analyzed zoanthid samples collected from local aquarium stores for
   palytoxin using liquid chromatography and high resolution mass
   spectrometry and attempted to identify the specimens through genetic
   analysis of 16S and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) markers. We found four
   specimens of the same apparent species of zoanthid, that we described
   previously to be responsible for a severe respiratory reaction in a home
   aquarium, to be available in three aquarium stores in the Washington D.
   C. area. We found all of these specimens (n = 4) to be highly toxic with
   palytoxin or palytoxin-like compounds (range 0.5-3.5 mg crude toxin/g
   zoanthid). One of the most potent non-protein compounds ever discovered
   is present in dangerous quantities in a select species of zoanthid
   commonly sold in the home aquarium trade.},

   concholepas: Variability, Toxin Profiles and Mechanisms for Toxicity
   Reduction},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms of toxin-producing microalgae are recurrent in
   southern Chile. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks pose the
   main threat to public health and the fishing industry in the Patagonian
   fjords. This study aims to increase understanding of the individual and
   spatial variability of PSP toxicity in the foot of Concholepas
   concholepas, Chile's most valuable commercial benthic invertebrate
   species, extracted from the Guaitecas Archipelago in Chilean Patagonia.
   The objective is to determine the effect of pigment removal and freezing
   during the detoxification process. A total of 150 specimens (>= 90 mm
   length) were collected from this area. The live specimens were
   transferred to a processing plant, where they were measured and gutted,
   the foot was divided into two equal parts, and pigment was manually
   removed from one of these parts. The PSP toxicity of each foot (edible
   tissue) was determined by mouse bioassay (MBA) and high-performance
   liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and postcolumn
   oxidation (HPLC-FLD PCOX). The individual toxicity per loco, as the
   species is known locally, varied from <30 to 146 mu g STX diHCL eq 100
   g(-1) (CV = 43.83\%) and from 5.96 to 216.3 mu g STX diHCL eq 100 g(-1)
   (CV = 34.63\%), using MBA and HPLC, respectively. A generalized linear
   model showed a negative relation between individual weight and toxicity.
   The toxicological profile showed a dominance of STX (>95\%), neoSTX and
   GTX2. The removal of pigment produced a reduction in PSP toxicity of up
   to 90\% and could represent a good detoxification tool moving forward.
   The freezing process in the muscle with pigment did not produce a clear
   pattern. There is a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of PSP toxicity via
   PCOX but not MBA. Furthermore, the study discusses possible management
   and commercialization implications of the findings regarding small-scale
   fisheries.},

Title = {Seaweed extracts as biological control of aflatoxins produced by
   Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus flavus},
Journal = {EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundMycotoxins are secondary metabolites made by a variety of
   molds and fungi. They contaminate a lot of food products and local crops
   during pre- and post-harvesting under favorable conditions like high
   temperature and moisture. Aspergillus species are the most common fungi
   that contaminate food and produce biochemicals known as mycotoxins.
   Aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2) are the major mycotoxins
   produced by A. flavus and A. parasiticus that harm animal and human
   health. These fungi are controlled by chemical fungicides, but these are
   harmful to the environment. The aim of this study was to determine
   whether the aflatoxigenic fungi can be exterminated only by marine algal
   extracts or not.ResultsThe findings showed that the tested seaweed
   extracts inhibited fungal growth and aflatoxins production to varying
   degrees. The maximum antifungal activity was recorded in Halimeda
   opuntia extract against A. parasiticus-24 and A. flavus-18 and
   Turbunaria decurrens extract against A. flavus-18 (with an inhibition
   percentage of 77.78\%), followed by Jania rubens extract against A.
   parasiticus-16 with inhibition percentage 75.88\% compared to the
   control. Aqueous extract of H. opuntia effectively eliminated aflatoxins
   (B1, B2, G1, and G2) in A. parasiticus-16 and A. parasiticus-24. T.
   decurrens extract could detoxify 100\% of aflatoxins in three isolates
   of A. parasiticus. J. rubens extract eliminated aflatoxins in A.
   parasiticus-15 and A. parasiticus-16 compared to their normal production
   using high-performance liquid chromatography.ConclusionsAccording to
   this study, the macroalgal species with numerous distinctive antifungal
   properties constituents significantly inhibited the growth and
   production of aflatoxin in A. parasiticus and A. flavus isolates. The
   findings supported the use of macroalgae as a biological control agent
   against fungi and their toxins.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography
   (diceCT), we examined the morphology of the oral glands of 12 species of
   the family Homalopsidae. Snakes of this family exhibit substantial
   interspecific morphological variation in their oral glands. Particular
   variables are the venom glands, ranging from large (e.g., Subsessor
   bocourti) to small (e.g., Erpeton tentaculatum). The supra- and
   infralabial glands are more uniform in morphology, being the second most
   developed in almost all the sampled species. Premaxillary glands
   distinct from the supralabial glands were observed in five species
   (Myron richardsonii, Bitia hydroides, Cantoria violacea, Fordonia
   leucobalia, and Gerarda prevostiana), in addition to Cerberus rynchops,
   the only species in which this condition was previously documented
   associated with the excretion of salt. In the three species of the
   saltwater group of homalopsids (C. violacea, F. leucobalia, and G.
   prevostiana), the premaxillary glands also extend posteriorly, occupying
   a large area above the supralabial gland, a condition not observed in
   any other species of snake studied thus far. Character evolution
   analyses indicate that premaxillary glands differentiated from the
   supralabial gland and evolved independently three or four times in the
   family, always in lineages that invaded marine habitats. Our results
   suggest that the differentiated premaxillary glands are likely salt
   glands, as is the case in C. rynchops. If corroborated, this increases
   to six or seven the number of independent evolutionary origins of salt
   glands in snakes that have undergone an evolutionary transition to
   marine life.
   We describe interspecific morphological variation in the oral glands of
   mud snakes. Venom glands range from large to small, while premaxillary
   glands distinct from the supralabial glands are observed in lineages
   that underwent a secondary transition to saltwater habitats. Our
   findings suggest that the differentiated premaxillary glands are likely
   salt glands that evolved independently three or four times in the
   family, increasing the number of evolutionary origins of salt glands in
   snakes.image},

Title = {Effects of feeding and reverse feeding jellyfish on the growth of
   Pampus argenteus juveniles and the detoxification of jellyfish
   toxins by serine protease},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {582},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {A 20 days feeding experiment and 15 days reversed feeding experiment
   were conducted to study the growth of Pampus argenteus juveniles under
   different feeding strategies. A total of 900 juveniles (an average +/-
   SD, 5.88 +/- 0.98 cm and 5.69 +/- 0.64 g) were divided into three
   feeding groups and the experiments run in triplicate. Each experimental
   tank contained 1000 L of water and each group was fed to satiation four
   times a day. Three groups were constructed: group A (fed with 100\%
   jellyfish), group B (fed with 100\% Yubao 5\# feed), and group C (fed
   with 50\% jellyfish and 50\% Yubao 5\# mixed feed). The remaining 200
   healthy individuals respectively in groups A and B were removed
   following the 20 days feeding experiment and subjected to 15 days of
   reverse feeding, resulting in group A' (fed with 100\% Yubao 5\# feed)
   and group B ` (fed with 100\% jellyfish). Yubao 5\# feed is 42\% protein
   while live jellyfish larvae with a 1-2 cm umbrella diameter contain
   approximately 10\% protein content. After 20 days, the results showed
   similar growth performance in terms of weight gain and specific growth
   rate (P > 0.05) for group A and B, indicating that the P. argenteus
   juveniles were able to survive on a jellyfish diet. However, the
   juveniles in group C showed significant (P < 0.05) weight gain and
   specific growth rate (8.96 +/- 0.77 and 4.739 +/- 0.572, respectively)
   over the same culture period. Serine protease (SP) was selected to study
   the detoxification mechanism of P. argenteus that were fed on jellyfish,
   and the SP enzyme activities, mRNA, and protein expression under
   different culture conditions were analyzed to illustrate the
   detoxification effect of SP protease on jellyfish toxin. The results
   showed that the highest SP enzyme activities occurred in the kidneys,
   liver, stomach, lateral capsules, caecum, and intestine (P < 0.05), with
   enzyme activity in the order group A > group C > group B, group A > A',
   and group B ` > B (P < 0.05). The highest enzyme activity of 188.91 UL
   /L was observed in group A when P. argenteus were fed jellyfish
   exclusively for 20 days (P < 0.05). The results indicate that jellyfish
   were the main contributors to the changes observed in the SP mRNA,
   protein, and enzyme activities. Our results indicate that P. argenteus
   juveniles can survive when feeding only on jellyfish and grow more
   rapidly when 50\% jellyfish is added to the feed than when fed with
   jellyfish or Yubao 5\# feed alone. SP enzymes, which are sensitive to
   jellyfish, play an important regulatory role in the digestion and
   decomposition of jellyfish by P. argenteus, and the kidneys are the most
   important organ for the detoxification and regulation of jellyfish
   toxin.},

Title = {Uptake and Depuration Kinetics of Pacific Ciguatoxins in Orange-Spotted

Volume = {54},

Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTXs), produced by toxic benthic dinoflagellates, can
   bioaccumulate in marine organisms at higher trophic levels. The current
   study evaluated the uptake and depuration kinetics of some of the most
   potent CTXs, Pacific CTX-1, -2, and -3 (P-CTX-1, -2, and -3), in
   orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) exposed to 1 ng P-CTXs
   g(-1) fish daily. Over a 30 d exposure, P-CTX-1, -2, and -3 were
   consistently detected in various tissues of exposed fish, and the
   concentrations of the total P-CTXs in tissues generally ranked following
   the order of liver, intestine, gill, skin, brain, and muscle. Relatively
   higher uptake rates of P-CTX-1 in the groupers were observed compared
   with those of P-CTX-2 and -3. The depuration rate constants of P- CTX-1,
   -2, and -3 in different tissues were (0.996-16.5) X 10(-2), (1.51 16.1)
   X 10(-2), and (0.557-10.6) X 10(-2) d(-1), respectively. The
   accumulation efficiencies of P-CTX-1, -2, and -3 in whole groupers were
   6.13\%, 2.61\%, and 1.15\%, respectively. The increasing proportion of
   P-CTX-1 and the decreasing proportion of P-CTX-2 and -3 over the
   exposure phase suggest a likely biotransformation of P-CTX-2 and -3 to
   P-CTX-1, leading to higher levels of P-CTX-1 in fish and possibly a
   higher risk of CTXs in long-term exposed fish.},

Title = {Injectable Nanosponge-Loaded Pluronic F127 Hydrogel for Pore-Forming
   Toxin Neutralization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {4239-4250},
Abstract = {Purpose: Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) perform important functions during
   bacterial infections. Among various virulence-targeting therapies,
   nanosponges (NSs) have excellent neutralization effects on multiple
   PFTs. To enhance treatment efficacy, NSs tend to be incorporated into
   other biomaterials, such as hydrogels.
   Methods: In the present work, red blood cell (RBC) vesicles were
   harvested to wrap polymer nanoparticles, leading to the formation of
   NSs, and the optimal Pluronic F127 hydrogel concentration was determined
   for gelation. Then, a novel detoxification system was constructed by
   incorporating NSs into an optimized Pluronic F127 hydrogel (NS-pGel).
   Next, the system was characterized by rheological and sustained release
   behavior as well as micromorphology. Then, the in vitro neutralization
   effect of NS-pGel on various PFTs was examined by a hemolysis protocol.
   Finally, therapeutic and prophylactic detoxification efficiency was
   evaluated in a mouse subcutaneous infection model in vivo.
   Results: A thermosensitive, injectable detoxification system was
   successfully constructed by loading NSs into a 30\% Pluronic F127
   hydrogel. Characterization results demonstrated that the NS-pGel hybrid
   system sustained an ideal fluidity and viscosity at lower temperatures
   but exhibited a quick sol-gel transition capacity near body temperature.
   In addition, this hybrid system had a sustained release behavior
   accompanied by good biocompatibility and biodegradability. Finally, the
   NS-pGel system showed neutralization effects similar to those of NSs
   both in vitro and in vivo, indicating a good preservation of NS
   functionality.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, we constructed a novel temperature-sensitive
   detoxification system with good biocompatibility and biodegradability,
   which may be applied to the clinical treatment of PFT-induced local
   lesions and infections.},

Title = {Fish feed as source of potentially allergenic peptides from the fish
   parasite Anisakis simplex (s.l.)},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {202},
Pages = {52-61},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The carry-over of certain feed components into animal products can be of
   concern for human health. The safety assessment of chemical contaminants
   including natural toxins, agrochemicals, veterinary drugs, and
   environmental pollutants is a key element of the ``farm-to-fork{''}
   ({''}One Health{''}) approach. The transmissibility of proteinaceous
   feed constituents such as enzymes, proteins from genetically engineered
   crops, and infectious prions in animal meal has also become of interest;
   but the transfer of proteins with allergic potential is little studied.
   In the present study, an exploratory zebrafish feeding trial using feed
   containing 20 percent of processed larvae of the marine fish parasite
   Anisakis simplex was performed as a proof-of-principle experiment. After
   a 2-week exposure period, anisakid peptides were detected in zebrafish
   tissue by high-resolution liquid-chromatography Orbit-rap mass
   spectrometry and immunostaining using specific polyclonal antibodies or
   sera from patients with confirmed allergy to A. simplex. Since fishmeal
   produced from marine pelagic fish is an important feed component in the
   culture of Atlantic salmon and in the poultry industry, it should be
   considered as a source of potentially allergenic peptides in the final
   products. Furthermore, the substitution of fishmeal with plant proteins
   would not eliminate the potential health risk by allergen carry-over
   since crops of high nutritional value such as legumes also contain
   important food allergens. If our preliminary results from the present
   zebrafish feeding trial should be confirmed in necessary follow-up
   experiments, the question of labeling information on fish and animal
   food products raised on feed containing potentially allergenic
   ingredients could arise in order to minimize the exposure risk of
   allergic consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adult scallops, Patinopecten yessoensis, held for 8 d separately in
   tanks and fed known amounts of cultured cells of the dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium tamarense were held without feeding for an additional 10 d.
   During the 18 d study, 3 scallops were removed every 2 d and the
   quantity of of each toxin present was analyzed individually, The toxins
   released into the environmental seawater were recovered and also
   analyzed. These experiments showed that the individual variation in
   bivalve toxicity often observed in feeding experiments and field surveys
   is due to differences in the amounts of dinoflagellate cells ingested by
   the bivalves and that a portion of the total amount of toxins
   accumulated in the scallop is released into the environmental water.
   However, the sum of the amount of toxins in the scallop and that
   released into the water cannot be explained in terms of the amount
   supplied by A. tamarense, suggesting that in addition to toxin
   accumulation from the food chain, another unknown mechanism is involved
   in toxin accumulation in the scallop. The toxins incorporated into the
   scallop from A. tamarense are considered to undergo metabolism in the
   scallop through which the toxins are changed to derivatives undetectable
   by HPLC.},

Abstract = {The pelagic harpacticoid copepod, Macrosetella gracilis (A. Scott), is
   found in association with colonies of the nitrogen-fixing
   (diazotrophic), bloomforming cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp, in
   tropical and subtropical waters, M. gracilis is one of the few direct
   grazers of these often toxic cyanobacteria. Experiments investigating
   NH4+ regeneration by M. 4 gracilis were conducted in the Caribbean in
   September 1992 and the Coral Sea, Australia in November 1994. Rates of
   M. gracilis ingestion of Trichodesmium thiebautii labelled with N-15(2)
   measured in the eastern Caribbean indicated that M. gracilis could
   consume 33 to 45\% of total T. thiebautii colony Nd-1 and > 100\% of new
   N fixed d(-1). We also measured the release of NH4+ by M. gracilis
   feeding on T. thiebautii, 4 as well as by non-feeding copepods, using
   N-15 isotope dilution methods. In non-feeding copepods, rates of NH4+
   release increased as numbers of copepods were 4 increased. In feeding
   copepods, the rate of NH4+ release 4 increased as both copepod numbers
   and food availability increased. In the presence of T. thiebautii
   colonies, M. gracilis had an average rate of NH4+ regeneration of 7.7
   +/- 1.5 nmol N copepod(-1) h(-1) (+/-SE), which was significantly higher
   than when food was absent (1.9 +/- 0.7 nmol N copepod(-1) h(-1)). Rates
   of M. gracilis excretion were relatively high based on
   excretion:ingestion ratios-which could be due to having a high-N food
   source readily available, to `'sloppy-feeding'' effects, or as a
   response to toxins in the cyanobacterium. Incubations of M. gracilis
   with and without T. erythraeum resulted in significant increases in
   {[}NH4+] as a function of copepod density only. Ammonium leakage from
   the cyanobacterium and/or microheterotroph associates was relatively
   low. M. gracilis, through excretion and possible mechanical breakage of
   cells while grazing, appears to provide a direct link between
   atmospherically derived `'new'' nitrogen and regenerated NH4+ in the
   oligotrophic systems where Trichodesmium spp. are abundant.},

Abstract = {The worldwide occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms makes it necessary to
   perform environmental risk assessment procedures to monitor the effects
   of microcytins on fish. Oxidative stress biomarkers are valuable tools
   in this regard. Considering that zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a common
   model species in fish toxicology and the zebrafish gill is potentially
   useful in screening waterborne pollutants, this study investigated the
   oxidative stress response in zebrafish gill exposed to subchronic
   microcystin-LR (MCLR) concentrations (2 or 20 mu g/l) via measurement of
   toxin accumulation, protein phosphatase (PP) activity, and the
   antioxidant parameters (glutathione-S-transferase-GST; glutathione-GSH;
   superoxide dismutase-SOD; catalase-CAT; glutathione peroxide-GPx;
   glutathione reductase-GR), as well as levels of hydroxyl radical (OH)
   and lipid peroxidation (LPO). The results showed that after 30 days
   exposure, MCLR accumulated in zebrafish gill and MCLR exposure induced
   PP activity in gill. A linear inhibition of GST activity and GSH content
   was observed in the gills, revealing that they were involved in the
   first step of MCLR detoxification. The 2 mu g/l MCLR treatment
   neglectably affected OH content and the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT,
   GPx, and GR), however oxidative stress was induced under the 20 mu g/l
   MCLR treatment in which an enhanced OH content and alterations of the
   antioxidant enzymes were observed in the treated gills, although both
   treatments exerted little effect on LPO level. The principal component
   analysis results indicated that the most sensitive biomarkers of MCLR
   exposure were GST and GSH in zebrafish gill. So, D. rerio could be
   regarded as a suitable bioindicator of MCLR exposure by measuring CAT,
   GR, GST, and GSH as biomarkers.},

Title = {Are Alexandrium catenella Blooms Spreading Offshore in Southern

Abstract = {The blooms of Alexandrium catenella, the main producer of paralytic
   shellfish toxins worldwide, have become the main threat to coastal
   activities in Southern Chile, such as artisanal fisheries, aquaculture
   and public health. Here, we explore retrospective data from an intense
   Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning outbreak in Southern Chile in
   Summer-Autumn 2016, identifying environmental drivers, spatiotemporal
   dynamics, and detoxification rates of the main filter-feeder shellfish
   resources during an intense A. catenella bloom, which led to the
   greatest socio-economic impacts in that area. Exponential detoxification
   models evidenced large differences in detoxification dynamics between
   the three filter-feeder species surf clam (Ensis macha), giant barnacle
   (Austromegabalanus psittacus), and red sea squirt (Pyura chilensis).
   Surf clam showed an initial toxicity (9054 mu g STX-eq<middle dot>100
   g(-1)) around 10-fold higher than the other two species. It exhibited a
   relatively fast detoxification rate and approached the human safety
   limit of 80 mu g STX-eq<middle dot>100 g(-1) towards the end of the 150
   days. Ecological implications and future trends are also discussed.
   Based on the cell density evolution, data previously gathered on the
   area, and the biology of this species, we propose that the bloom
   originated in the coastal area, spreading offshore thanks to the resting
   cysts formed and transported in the water column.},

Abstract = {Marine micro/nanoplastic (MNP) contamination has evolved into a serious
   threat to the ecosystem. Unfortunately, MNPs can act as vectors for
   heavy metals (e.g., Pb(ii)), which can exacerbate their ecotoxicological
   effects. The development of MNPs removal methods, as well as, MNP
   surface clean-up strategies is, therefore, crucial to remediating marine
   MNP pollution. Herein, we report a magnetic ``nano-fishnet{''} (i.e.,
   alkylated nanoscale zerovalent iron grown on naturally derived cellulose
   nanofibers (ac-nZVI)) to quickly enrich and trap MNPs from seawater.
   Driven by the attractive electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of
   ac-ZVI, the removal efficiency of 100 nm, 2 \& mu;m and 10 \& mu;m MNPs
   (PS, PVC, PMMA) from artificial seawater (ASW) has been shown to reach
   98.28\%, 98.58\% and 97.64\% within 1 min, with the calculated
   collection capability of 40.96, 167.62 and 324.88 mg(MNPs) g(Fe)(-1),
   respectively. Similarly, its rapid and complete removal performance has
   also been demonstrated in MNP-spiked natural seawater. Furthermore, the
   microscopic reaction behaviors between ac-nZVI and MNPs with different
   sizes are unraveled; the mechanism involves the encapsulation of single
   plastic spheres, adhesion of multiple particles and trapping of larger
   aggregates. After the reaction, the MNPs are packaged and removed using
   a magnet. Moreover, the unique core-shell structure endows the iron
   nanoparticles with rich aquatic chemistry properties for Pb(ii)
   transformation and detoxification. The full contact between ac-nZVI and
   MNPs facilitates the reduction reactions between Fe-0 and Pb(ii); thus,
   Pb(ii) on the MNP surface is reduced to Pb-0. Our work suggests an
   appealing strategy for the remediation of MNP-polluted seawater and
   proposes a new concept for the toxin decontamination of MNPs.},

Abstract = {To better understand the effect of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PSTs)
   accumulation in the digestive gland of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea
   gigas, we experimentally exposed individual oysters for 48 h to a PSTs
   producer, the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. In comparison to the
   effect of the non-toxic Alexandrium tamarense, on the eight apoptotic
   related genes tested, Bax and BI.1 were significantly upregulated in
   oysters exposed 48 h to A. catenella. Among the five detoxification
   related genes tested, the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A) was
   shown to be correlated with toxin concentration in the digestive gland
   of oysters exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate. Beside this, we observed
   a significant increase in ROS production, a decrease in caspase-3/7
   activity and normal percentage of apoptotic cells in this tissue. Taken
   together, these results suggest a feedback mechanism, which may occur in
   the digestive gland where BI.1 could play a key role in preventing the
   induction of apoptosis by PSTs. Moreover, the expression of CYP1A, Bax
   and BI.1 were found to be significantly correlated to the occurrence of
   natural toxic events, suggesting that the expression of these genes
   together could be used as biomarker to assess the biological responses
   of oysters to stress caused by PSTs.},

Abstract = {The northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria was exposed to bloom
   concentrations of the toxic red-tide dinoflagellate Alexandrium, the
   proximal cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in eastern North
   America, under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Two cultured
   isolates of Alexandrium, exhibiting markedly different PSP toxin
   compositions and specific toxicities, were used independently to
   determine the kinetics of toxin accumulation and loss, as well as the
   potential for biotransformation of individual PSP toxins in certain
   tissues. Clams readily ingested and absorbed a monospecific diet of the
   low toxicity A. tamarense isolate GtLI22. They also ingested cells of
   the high toxicity A. fundyense isolate GtCA29, but at a lower rate, and
   only when the diet was supplemented with a nontoxic diatom,
   Thalassiosira weissflogii. As natural populations of M. mercenaria
   rarely accumulate a substantial PSP toxin load, this suggests the
   existence of a toxin recognition mechanism. Maximum toxicities in clam
   tissues, attained within 2 wk of exposure to either toxic
   dinoflagellate, exceeded the regulatory harvest closure level (80-mu-g
   STXeq 100 g-1) by several orders of magnitude. Detoxification to levels
   acceptable for human consumption occurred within 3 to 6 wk. HPLC
   analyses revealed significant differences between the toxic profile of
   the dinoflagellates and that accumulated in various clam tissues. Clams
   toxified with isolate GtLI22, a strain rich in low potency C-toxins,
   showed: (1) de novo appearance of STX, (2) significant reduction in the
   proportion of C-toxins, and (3) reciprocal increase in the proportion of
   the gonyautoxins GTX2+3. Significant relative enrichment in STX also
   occurred in tissues of clams fed upon GtCA29, an isolate rich in the
   more potent carbamate toxins. The first experimental evidence of PSP
   accumulation/detoxification by M. mercenaria is provided, underscoring
   the potential of this species to act as a vector of PSP in humans.},

Abstract = {Azaspiracids (AZAs) are a group of shellfish toxins that were discovered
   in mussels from Irish waters in 1995. Because of the rare occurrence of
   poisoning incidents, the toxicity of the compounds is a continued matter
   of debate. Neither their mechanism of action nor their pharmacokinetic
   behavior has been elucidated, principally because of the lack of
   standards and reference tissues. Procedures to isolate AZAs from
   contaminated shellfish or to synthesize them have been developed; in
   particular, the procedures used for the preparative isolation of these
   toxins are currently being improved. The present paper describes the
   stability of AZAs in an array of pH and temperature conditions in
   methanolic solution, in shellfish tissue, and in aqueous mixtures of
   acids and shellfish tissues. Strong acids such as hydrochloric and
   formic acid led to rapid degradation of AZA1 at mM concentration, while
   the weaker acetic acid required harsher temperature conditions (70
   degrees C) and greater concentrations to show similar effects. AZAs
   showed much greater stability in aqueous acidic mixtures with shellfish
   tissues, suggesting a significant protective effect of the matrix. A
   mechanism for the acid-catalyzed degradation is proposed, supported by
   mass spectral evidence from some of the degradation products. Strong
   bases (sodium hydroxide) also showed a detrimental effect on AZA1;
   however, weaker bases (ammonium hydroxide) did not lead to degradation
   over 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the toxic potential of acid
   degradation products of AZAs was found to be dramatically reduced
   compared to the parent compounds, as assessed through cytotoxicity.},

Abstract = {Toxin production is widespread among aquatic microalgae, suggesting a
   functional advantage for organisms producing toxic compounds. However,
   the biological role of algal toxin production is only vaguely
   understood. Here, we show that excretion of a toxic substance in the
   phagotrophic phytoflagellate Prymnesium parvum (Prymnesiophyceae)
   constitutes a mechanism to immobilize and seize motile prey. Feeding
   frequency of P. parvum in dilute batch cultures was low when fed the
   motile prey Heterocapsa rotundata (dinoflagellate). However, dense
   cultures caused inunobilization of H. rotundata cells, thereby allowing
   P. parvum to feed on them. In contrast, when fed a nonmotile prey-the
   diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana-feeding frequency was high, even in
   dilute P. parvum cultures. We could demonstrate that feeding frequency
   of P. parvum on H. rotundata was positively correlated with the measure
   of the toxic effect causing immobilization and lysis of prey cells. The
   fact that the toxic effect on H. rotundata was found in cell-free
   filtrate of P. parvum cultures suggests that immobilization and lysis of
   prey cells were caused by the excretion of toxins.},

Title = {Interannual variability in the timing of New England shellfish toxicity
   and relationships to environmental forcing},

Abstract = {Routine monitoring along the coast of the Gulf of Maine (GoM) reveals
   shellfish toxicity nearly every summer, but at varying times, locations,
   and magnitudes. The responsible toxin is known to be produced by the
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense, yet there is little apparent
   association between Alexandrium abundance and shellfish toxicity. One
   possibility is that toxic cells are persistent in offshore areas and
   variability in shellfish toxicity is caused not by changes in overall
   abundance, but rather by variability in transport processes.
   Measurements of offshore Alexandrium biomass are scarce, so we bypass
   cell abundance as an explanatory variable and focus instead on the
   relations between shellfish toxicity and concurrent metrics of GoM
   meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography. While this yields over two
   decades (1985-2005) of data representing a variety of interannual
   conditions, the toxicity data are gappy in spatial and temporal
   coverage. We address this through a combination of parametric curve
   fitting and hierarchical cluster analysis to reveal eight archetypical
   modes of seasonal toxicity timing. Groups of locations are then formed
   that have similar interannual patterns in these archetypes. Finally, the
   interannual patterns within each group are related to available
   environmental metrics using classification trees. Results indicate that
   a weak cross-shore sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the summer
   is the strongest correlate of shellfish toxicity, likely by signifying a
   hydrological connection between offshore Alexandrium populations and
   near-shore shellfish beds. High cumulative downwelling wind strength
   early in the season is revealed as a precursor consistent with this
   mechanism. Although previous studies suggest that alongshore transport
   is important in moving Alexandrium from the eastern to western GoM,
   alongshore SST gradient is not an important correlate of toxicity in our
   study. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for
   designing efficient and effective shellfish monitoring programs along
   the GoM coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Recent trends in paralytic shellfish toxins in Puget Sound,
   relationships to climate, and capacity for prediction of toxic events},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Temporal and spatial trends in paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in
   Puget Sound shellfish and their relationships with climate are
   investigated using long-term monitoring data since 1957. Data are
   selected for trend analyses based on the sensitivity of shellfish
   species to PSTs and their depuration rates, and the frequency of sample
   collection at individual sites. These criteria limit the analyses to the
   shellfish species Mytilus edulis at 20 sites from 1993 to 2007. Blue
   mussel toxicity is highly variable, but typically exceeds the regulatory
   limit for human consumption from July to November annually, with most
   closures occurring early in fall. Using blue mussel data only, we find
   no robust evidence to suggest that the frequency, magnitude, duration,
   or geographic scope of PST events in Puget Sound increased between 1993
   and 2007. However, there is a significant basin-wide trend for closures
   to occur earlier in the year. There are no significant correlations
   between annual indices of mussel toxicity and aspects of the local and
   large-scale climate. Case studies of daily variations in local
   environmental factors leading up to exceptionally toxic events identify
   a combination of conditions that generally precedes most closures from
   1993 to 2007. These results suggest that periods of warm air and water
   temperatures and low streamflow on sub-seasonal timescales may
   facilitate toxin accumulation in mussels. No relationships were found
   between water residence times in the surface layer and either streamflow
   or mussel toxicity. Recommendations are made for future monitoring to
   improve forecasting of PST risks in Puget Sound, an important region for
   recreational, commercial, and tribal subsistence shellfish harvesting.

   nutrient-treated seawater. Toxin concentration was monitored with
   LC-ESI-MS.
   During different exposures, the amount of nodularin detected in mussels
   increased linearly with increasing toxin concentration in food and
   attained 0.28-13.8 mu g of nodularin g dw(-1) of the mussel whole body
   tissue after 12h. The digestive gland was found to be the tissue with
   the highest toxin concentration. Nodularin concentration in faeces was
   not proportional to faeces production or to toxin concentration in food;
   however, it seemed to be mostly related to food quality as well as to
   food availability. The percentage of nodularin taken up by the mussels,
   relative to the amount contained in the offered food, varied from 10\%
   to 20\%, depending on food quality. During a 5-day toxin accumulation
   experiment, the acute reduction of the toxin in mussel tissues the
   second day and the following stabilization, showed that probably mussels
   maintain low toxin levels via efficient elimination and/or toxin
   metabolism. After a 72 h depuration period, mussels showed 75\%
   reduction in their toxin content. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Lack of accumulation of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in

Abstract = {To clarify the fate of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in
   planktonic food webs, toxin contents of the planktonic ciliate Favella
   taraikaensis feeding on Alexandrium tamarense and of the surrounding
   seawater were examined in laboratory experiments using high-performance
   liquid chromatography fluorometric detection. During 5 or 6 d incubation
   periods in 3 replicate experiments, F taraikaensis actively ingested A,
   tamarense and reached 8 to 17-fold initial density values. At the end of
   the incubation, the toxin concentration of the suspension consisting
   mostly of F taraikaensis, which had increased by feeding on A.
   tamarense, was much lower than that of A. tamarense cells. The toxin
   content of pure F taraikaensis, which was analyzed based on 165 to 200
   individuals of E taraikaensis directly taken from the suspension, was
   also lower than the cellular toxicity of A. tamarense. Toxin
   concentration in filtrates of the F taraikaensis suspension was
   significantly higher than that in filtrates of the suspension containing
   only A. tamarense. Furthermore, the total toxin concentration in the F.
   taraikaensis suspension (particulates plus the filtrate) was almost
   equivalent to that in the A. tamarense suspension in each trial, We
   conclude that the PSP toxins of A. tamarense are not accumulated in F
   taraikaensis over 24 h in the course of predator-prey interactions, and
   the toxins are rapidly excreted from the cell body of the ciliate.},

Abstract = {The growing prevalence of new toxins in the environment continues to
   cause widespread concerns. Pharmaceuticals, organic pollutants, heavy
   metal ions, endocrine-disrupting substances, microorganisms, and others
   are examples of persistent organic chemicals whose effects are unknown
   because they have recently entered the environment and are displaying up
   in wastewater treatment facilities. Pharmaceutical pollutants in
   discharged wastewater have become a danger to animals, marine species,
   humans, and the environment. Although their presence in drinking water
   has generated significant concerns, little is known about their destiny
   and environmental effects. As a result, there is a rising need for
   selective, sensitive, quick, easy-to-handle, and low-cost early
   monitoring detection systems. This study aims to deliver an overview of
   a low-cost carbon-based composite to detect and remove pharmaceutical
   components from wastewater using the literature reviews and bibliometric
   analysis technique from 1970 to 2021 based on the web of science (WoS)
   database. Various pollutants in water and soil were reviewed, and
   different methods were introduced to detect pharmaceutical pollutants.
   The advantages and drawbacks of varying carbon-based materials for
   sensing and removing pharmaceutical wastes were also introduced.
   Finally, the available techniques for wastewater treatment, challenges
   and future perspectives on the recent progress were highlighted. The
   suggestions in this article will facilitate the development of novel
   on-site methods for removing emerging pollutants from pharmaceutical
   effluents and commercial enterprises.},

Abstract = {The paper builds on existing literature, highlighting current
   understanding and identifying unresolved issues about MeHg exposure,

   predatory fish or for whom fish is a dietary mainstay. Methylmercury
   developmental neurotoxicity has constituted the basis for risk
   assessments and public health policies. Despite gaps in our knowledge on
   new bioindicators of exposure, factors that influence MeHg uptake and
   toxicity, toxicokinetics, neurologic and cardiovascular effects in adult
   populations, and the nutritional benefits and risks from the large
   number of marine and freshwater fish and fish-eating species, the panel
   concluded that to preserve human health, all efforts need to be made to

Abstract = {The dynamic transmission and transformation of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs) from the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense to the
   cladoceran Moina mongolica and subsequently to the larvae of the fish
   Sciaenops ocellatus were investigated under laboratory conditions. The
   results showed that PSTs could be transferred to S. ocellatus when they
   preyed on PST-containing M. mongolica. During the experimental period,
   A. tamarense, M. mongolica and the digestive glands of the fish larvae
   contained C(1/2) toxins, and the viscera of S. ocellatus contained
   neoSTX. The proportion of beta toxin (C(2)) in C(1+2) toxins increased
   when PSTs were transferred from A. tamarense to M. mongolica, but in the
   subsequent transfer from M. mongolica to S. ocellatus the proportion of
   a toxin (C(1)) increased. During depuration, the contents of C, and C2
   toxins in fish larvae decreased with the duration of depuration, but
   neoSTX remained relatively constant. The present results indicated that,
   using a cladoceran as the vector, PSTs can be transferred from toxic
   algae to a high trophic level fish and metabolized in the fish. Future
   work should address the metabolic characteristics of PSTs in cladocerans
   and the end result when they are transferred to fishes. (c) 2007

Abstract = {Bacteria associated with toxic algae in culture have been implicated in
   the enhancement of algal toxin production and in auto-toxigenesis, with
   taxon specificity of the bacteria suggested to be important in their
   association with the algae. In this study, bacteria isolated from toxic
   and nontoxic dinoflagellates have been examined for both their potential
   to produce sodium channel blocking (SCB) toxins, as ascertained by the
   mouse neuroblastoma assay, and their ability to biotransform paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST) using high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). Toxigenic bacteria were found to belong to the alpha- and
   gamma-Proteobacteria. Bacteria capable of SCB activity were present in
   PST-producing Alexandrium tamarense and A. lusitanicum cultures, while
   the bacterial flora isolated from a non-toxic A. tamarense strain did
   not appear to demonstrate this trait. A disparate population of the
   bacterial flora associated with non-PST-producing Scrippsiella
   trochoidea also demonstrated SCB activity. Some bacteria from all the
   dinoflagellates examined were capable of transforming PST, with possible
   mechanisms including oxidase activity with transformation of
   gonyautoxins GTX 2/3 to GTX 1/4, reductive elimination as demonstrated
   by the transformation of GTX 1/4 to GTX 2/3, and further unknown
   pathways. Noticeably, there was little overlap between bacteria
   demonstrating SCB activity and those that were able to modify PST,
   indicating that biosynthesis of SCB toxins and catabolism of PST may not
   be related in these bacterial isolates.},

Title = {Selenocompounds in juvenile white sturgeon: Estimating absorption,
   disposition, and elimination of selenium using Bayesian hierarchical
   modeling},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {The biological function of selenium (Se) is determined by its form and
   concentration. Selenium is an essential micronutrient for all
   vertebrates, however, at environmental levels, it is a potent toxin. In
   the San Francisco Bay-Delta, Se pollution threatens top predatory fish,
   including white sturgeon. A multi-compartmental Bayesian hierarchical
   model was developed to estimate the fractional rates of absorption,
   disposition, and elimination of selenocompounds, in white sturgeon, from
   tissue measurements obtained in a previous study (Huang et al., 2012).
   This modeling methodology allows for a population based approach to
   estimate kinetic physiological parameters in white sturgeon. Briefly,
   thirty juvenile white sturgeon (five per treatment) were orally
   intubated with a control (no selenium) or a single dose of Se (500 mu g
   Se/kg body weight) in the form of one inorganic (Selenite) or four
   organic selenocompounds: selenocystine (SeCys), L-selenomethionine
   (SeMet), Se-methylseleno-L-cysteine (MSeCys), or selenoyeast (SeYeast).
   Blood and urine Se were measured at intervals throughout the 48 h post
   intubation period and eight tissues were sampled at 48 h. The model is
   composed of four state variables, conceptually the gut (Q(1)), blood
   (Q(2)), and tissue (Q(3)); and urine (Q(0)), all in units of viz Se. Six
   kinetics parameters were estimated: the fractional rates {[}1/h] of
   absorption, tissue disposition, tissue release, and urinary elimination
   (k(12), k(23), k(32), and k(20)), the proportion of the absorbed dose
   eliminated through the urine (f(20)), and the distribution blood volume
   (V; percent body weight, BW). The parameter k(12) was higher in sturgeon
   given the organic Se forms, in the descending order of MSeCys > SeMet >
   SeCys > Selenite > SeYeast. The parameters k(23) and k(32) followed
   similar patterns, and f(20) was lowest in fish given MSeCys. Selenium
   form did not affect k(20) or V. The parameter differences observed can
   be attributed to the different mechanisms of transmucosal transport,
   metabolic reduction, and storage of the Se forms, which, in general,
   appear to be similar to that in mammals. We have demonstrated that the
   Bayesian approach is a powerful tool for integrating quantitative
   information from a study with sparse blood and urinary measurements and
   tissue concentrations from a single time point, while providing a full
   characterization of parameter variability. The model permits the
   quantitative mechanistic interpretation and predictions of Se
   absorption, disposition, and elimination processes. Furthermore, the
   model represents a first step towards population based physiological
   toxicokinetic modeling of Se in white sturgeon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Dual characteristics of Bellamya aeruginosa
   encountering Microcystis aeruginosa: Algal control and
   toxin depuration},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {252},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The benthic gastropods Bellamya aeruginosa (B. aeruginosa) is ubiquitous
   in freshwater in China and neighboring countries with great edible
   value. It has been recognized as a potential manipulator to control
   harmful algal blooms due to its filtration on algal cells. In this
   study, the control effect of B. aeruginosa on toxic and non-toxic
   Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa), and the accumulation and
   depuration of microcystins (MCs) in the snail were systematically
   explored. Results indicated that although toxic M. aeruginosa could
   protect itself via pro-ducing MCs, the introduction of B. aeruginosa
   could still effectively inhibit the algae with cell density below 1 x
   106 cells/mL. Hepatopancreas was the primary target of MCs in all
   tissues of B. aeruginosa, presenting a maximum of 3089.60 ng/g DW when
   exposed to toxic M. aeruginosa of 1.0 x 107 cells/mL. The enrichment of
   MCs in other tissues following the order of digestive tract > gonad >
   mantle > muscle. Interestingly, snail could again excrete previously
   enriched MCs when transferred to non-toxic M. aeruginosa, giving rise to
   over 80\% reduction of MCs in the body. After depuration, the estimated
   daily intake (EDI) of free MCs in intact individuals and the edible
   parts of B. aeruginosa were both lower than the tolerable daily intake
   (TDI). These results implicated that B. aeruginosa could control low
   density of M. aeruginosa in spring. Particularly, the snail could be
   perfectly safe to consume by purifying for a while after using as
   manipulator.},

Title = {Effects of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa on the silver carp
   Hypophthalmichtys molitrix revealed by hepatic RNA-seq and

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the effects of toxic
   Microcystis aeruginosa on the silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix.
   Silver carps were exposed to two cyanobacteria species (toxic and
   non-toxic) for RNA-seq and miRNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that the
   liver tissue contained 105,379 unigenes. Of these genes, 143 were
   significantly differentiated, 82 were markedly up-regulated, and 61 were
   remarkably down-regulated. GO term enrichment analysis indicated that 35
   of the 154 enriched GO terms were significantly enriched. KEGG pathway
   enrichment analysis demonstrated that 17 of the 118 enriched KEGG
   pathways were significantly enriched. A considerable number of
   disease/immune-associated GO terms and significantly enriched KEGG
   pathways were also observed. The sequence length determined by miRNA-seq
   was mainly distributed in 20-23 bp and composed of 882,620 unique small
   RNAs, and 53\% of these RNAs were annotated to miRNAs. As confirmed, 272
   known miRNAs were differentially expressed, 453 novel miRNAs were
   predicted, 112 miRNAs were well matched with 7,623 target genes, and 203
   novel miRNAs were matched with 15,453 target genes. qPCR also indicated
   that Steap4, Cyp7a1, CABZ01088134.1, and PPP1R3G were significantly
   differentially expressed and might play major roles in the toxic,
   detoxifying, and antitoxic mechanisms of microcystin in fish.},

Title = {Combined Effects of Temperature and Toxic Algal Abundance on Paralytic
   Shellfish Toxic Accumulation, Tissue Distribution and Elimination
   Dynamics in Mussels Mytilus coruscus},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This study assessed the impact of increasing seawater surface
   temperature (SST) and toxic algal abundance (TAA) on the accumulation,
   tissue distribution and elimination dynamics of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs) in mussels. Mytilus coruscus were fed with the
   PSTs-producing dinoflagellate A. catenella under four simulated
   environment conditions. The maximum PSTs concentration was determined to
   be 3548 mu g STX eq.kg(-1), which was four times higher than the EU
   regulatory limit. The increasing SST caused a significant decline in
   PSTs levels in mussels with rapid elimination rates, whereas high TAA
   increased the PSTs concentration. As a result, the PSTs toxicity levels
   decreased under the combined condition. Additionally, toxin burdens were
   assessed within shellfish tissues, with the highest levels quantified in
   the hepatopancreas. It is noteworthy that the toxin burden shifted
   towards the mantle from gill, muscle and gonad at the 17th day.
   Moreover, variability of PSTs was measured, and was associated with
   changes in each environmental factor. Hence, this study primarily
   illustrates the combined effects of SST and TAA on PSTs toxicity,
   showing that increasing environmental temperature is of benefit to lower
   PSTs toxicity with rapid elimination rates.},

Abstract = {Most seafoods available to the U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to
   cause illness in the consumer. Nevertheless, there are areas of risk.
   The major risk of acute disease is associated with the consumption of
   raw shellfish, particularly bivalve molluscs. For persons living in
   tropical areas, there is a risk of ciguatera; other natural toxins
   (paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, etc.)
   have been associated with shellfish from endemic areas. Finally, there
   are less well-defined risks of acute and chronic disease related to
   environmental contamination of aquatic food animals. Dealing with such
   risks on a short-term basis requires improvements in the present system
   of regulatory control. In the long term, amelioration and eventual
   elimination of some hazards require strengthening and more effective
   application of control measures to prevent the disposal of human and
   industrial waste into offshore marine and fresh waters.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial bloom elimination has become an urgent concern in aquatic
   environment protection. Allelopathic technology, however, is one of the
   potential effective approaches because of its exclusive and ecological
   safety protection. The potential application of chitosan fiber in the
   inhibition of Microcystis aeruginosa was explored for the first time.
   Results showed that the cell growth of M. aeruginosa was inhibited
   effectively by chitosan fibers. After 12 days of treatment, the
   inhibition rate (IR) of algal cells was above 78.9\%; those of
   chlorophyll a and carotenoids in algal cells were 86.9\% and 93.1\%,
   respectively; those of phycocyanin, allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin in
   phycobiliproteins were all approximately 100\%; those of soluble
   proteins and algal toxins were 88\% and 100\%, respectively; and those
   of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were 68\% and 74\%,
   respectively. In addition, chitosan fiber effectively destroyed the
   structure of algal cells involved in the photosynthetic process, thereby
   destroying the metabolic activity of algal cells. This study provides a
   novel method utilizing a new allelopathic material.},

Title = {Accumulation of paralytic shellfish toxins by Southern Rock lobster
   Jasus edwardsii causes minimal impact on lobster health},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {230},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recurrent dinoflagellate blooms of Alexandrium catenella expose the
   economically and ecologically important Southern Rock Lobster in
   Tasmania to paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), and it is unknown if PST
   accumulation adversely affects lobster performance, health and
   catchability. In a controlled aquaculture setting, lobsters were fed
   highly contaminated mussels to accumulate toxin levels in the
   hepatopancreas (mean of 6.65 mg STX center dot 2HCl equiv. kg(-1)),
   comparable to those observed in nature. Physiological impact of PST
   accumulation was comprehensively assessed by a range of behavioural
   (vitality score, righting ability and reflex impairment score), health
   (haemocyte count, bacteriology, gill necrosis and parasite load),
   nutritional (hepatopancreas index and haemolymph refractive index) and
   haemolymph biochemical (21 parameters including electrolytes,
   metabolites, and enzymes) parameters during a 63 day period of uptake
   and depuration of toxins. Exposure to PST did not result in mortality
   nor significant changes in the behavioural, health, or nutritional
   measures suggesting limited gross impact on lobster performance.
   Furthermore, most haemolymph biochemical parameters measured exhibited
   no significant difference between control and exposed animals. However,
   the concentration of potassium in the haemolymph increased with PST,
   whilst the concentration of lactate and the sodium:potassium ratio
   decreased with PST. In addition, exposed lobsters showed a
   hyperglycaemic response to PST exposure, indicative of stress. These
   findings suggest that PST accumulation results in some measurable
   indicators of stress for lobsters. However, these changes are likely
   within the adaptive range for Jasus edwardsii and do not result in a
   significant impairment of gross performance. Our findings support
   previous conclusions that crustaceans are relatively tolerant to PST and
   the implications for the lobster fishery are discussed.},

Abstract = {Mussels are quite resistant to cyanotoxins and their resistance may be
   because of an efficient metabolization of cyanotoxins by
   glutathione-S-transferases (GST) activity. Nevertheless, other secondary
   metabolites may interfere with the detoxication efficiency. The
   accumulation and depuration of hepatotoxins produced by the freshwater
   cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in the mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis were studied. Mussels were fed twice a day 1.5 x 10(5)
   cells/mL of the toxic cyanobacterium, which produces microcystins (MCs)
   -FR, -LR and -WR, for 4 days. After that period, the animals were placed
   in toxin-free water and were fed the green algae Ankistrodesmus sp.
   During 2 weeks, the concentration of the toxin in the mussels was
   monitored using an ELISA assay. Mussels showed a maximum detectable
   level of MCs of 0.38 mu g/g mussels dry weight (DW) during the
   accumulation period and 0.37 mu g MC/g mussel DW by day 4 of the
   depuration period. Then there was a decrease trend with peaks of toxin
   at days 8 and 12 of the depuration period. The activity of the
   detoxication enzymes GST was studied and the results showed that the
   peaks of toxin in the mussels coincide with an increase in the activity
   of GST. These results support the hypothesis that the rise of the toxin
   level on days 4, 8 and 12 of the depuration period in the mussels may be
   related to the renewal of protein phosphatases and subsequent release of
   unbound toxins. J. Exp. Zool. 311A:226-230, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Anemonia sulcata may be a source of marine natural products (MNPs) due
   to the antioxidant and antitumor activity of its crude homogenates shown
   in vitro in colon cancer cells. A bioguided chromatographic
   fractionation assay of crude Anemonia sulcata homogenates with and
   without its symbiont Symbiodinium was performed to characterize their
   bioactive composition and further determine their biological potential
   for the management of colorectal cancer (CRC). The 20\% fractions
   retained the in vitro antioxidant activity previously reported for
   homogenates. As such, activation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes
   was also evaluated. The 40\% fractions showed the greatest
   antiproliferative activity in T84 cells, synergistic effects with
   5-fluoruracil and oxaliplatin, overexpression of apoptosis-related
   proteins, cytotoxicity on tumorspheres, and antiangiogenic activity. The
   predominantly polar lipids and toxins tentatively identified in the 20\%
   and 40\% fractions could be related to their biological activity in
   colon cancer cells although further characterizations of the active
   fractions are necessary to isolate and purify the bioactive compounds.},

Abstract = {In the era of climate changes, harmful dinoflagellate outbreaks that
   produce potent algal toxins, odor, and water discoloration in aquatic
   environments have been increasingly reported. Thus, various treatments
   have been attempted for the mitigation and management of harmful blooms.
   Here, we report engineered nanoparticles that consist of two different
   types of rylene derivatives encapsulated in polymeric micelles. In
   addition, to avoid dissociation of the aggregate, the core of micelle
   was stabilized via semi-interpenetrating network (sIPN) formation. On
   two types of the marine red-tide dinoflagellates, Akashiwo sanguinea and
   Alexandrium pacificum, the nanoparticle uptake followed by fluorescence
   labeling and photothermal effect was conducted. Firstly, fluorescence
   microscopy enabled imaging of the dinoflagellates with the ultraviolet
   chromophore, Lumogen Violet. Lastly, near-infrared (NIR) laser
   irradiation was exposed on the Lumogen IR788 nanoparticle-treated Ak.
   Sanguinea. The irradiation resulted in reduced cell survival due to the
   photothermal effect in microalgae. The results suggested that the
   nanoparticle, IR788-sIPN, can be applied for potential red-tide algal
   elimination.},

Title = {Aluminum Silicate Organic Framework for the Removal of Industrial
   Organic Toxins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {An initial investigation was followed by a semi-industrial analysis
   aimed at evaluating the ability of our new adsorbent system in various
   sectors to eliminate specific environmental hazards. A novel
   nanocomposite was fabricated through the impregnation of pulverized
   marine plant organic products into an aluminum silicate (AS) framework,
   resulting in the formation of an AS mixed organic structure framework
   (ASMOSF). Different characterization techniques including scanning
   electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence
   (XRF), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were applied.
   The adsorption capacity of our innovative ASMOSF nanocomposite is
   notably greater than that of AS and mixed organic structure (MOS)
   nanocomposites, particularly when exposed to Congo red (CR)
   concentrations below 20 ppm. Using batch experiments, the kinetics and
   isotherms of CR dye adsorption, in addition to the effects of a
   multitude of experimental parameters, were investigated. The CR removal
   percentage is significantly influenced by the operating temperature, the
   quantity of adsorbent utilized, and the pH level. In an aqueous solution
   with a neutral pH, the optimum temperature for CR adsorption onto ASMOSF
   is 40 degrees C. Depending on the concentration of CR, AS and MOS employ
   two distinct kinetic adsorption models; however, for CR adsorption on
   ASMOSF, the first-order diffusion model is efficacious. Lastly, field
   testing demonstrated that the ASMOSF nanocatalyst effectively eliminated
   mixed colors from industrial wastewater with a removal rate of 95\%.
   This finding provides a foundation for the development of novel
   eco-friendly nanoadsorbents that can facilitate the reutilization of
   industrial wastewater.},

Abstract = {Purple clams (Hiatula rostrata Lighttoot) accumulate paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) toxins produced by a toxic strain of the dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium minutum Halim. The results confirm the data of our previous
   study concerning the muscle and siphon that were not showing a gradual
   rise in toxicity when shellfish accumulated more A. minutum. However,
   muscle and siphon are intermittently toxic both in exposure and
   depuration period in laboratory cultured purple clams. PSP toxins were
   detected in outdoor cultured purple clams, whereas no A. minutum were
   found in the culture pond during most of the survey time. The outdoor
   cultured purple clams need longer time to decrease toxicity to allowable
   levels than laboratory cultured purple clams. It was shown that
   laboratory data may not predict times over which pond-cultured purple
   clams may prove toxic to consumers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {``SALMON SOVEREIGNTY{''} AND THE DILEMMA OF INTENSIVE ATLANTIC SALMON
   AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT IN BRITISH COLUMBIA},

Abstract = {Agricultural industrialization and globalization are often identified as
   key processes in the erosion of food security and sovereignty. Global
   seafood production is dominated by modern day hunter-gatherers and so
   food sovereignty debates until recently have been confined to
   terrestrial systems. The recent introduction and subsequent spectacular
   proliferation of industrial marine aquaculture has brought the food
   sovereignty debate to the sea. The current hub of North American
   marine-based industrial aquaculture is British Columbia (BC) where
   salmon farming has grown to become a major factor in shaping coastal
   communities. Since its introduction into BC in the mid-1980s, the global
   industrial salmon farming industry has changed dramatically. The
   meteoric rise of farm salmon production exported from Norway, Chile, and
   Scotland has caused global salmon prices to plummet, forcing intense
   industry-wide rationalization. This is typically characterized by large
   multinationals cannibalizing smaller producers in order to establish
   economies of scale to counterbalance market price erosion of their
   product. As a result, global market forces have all but eliminated the
   sovereignty of both BC salmon farmers and salmon fishermen. Salmon
   farmers and fishermen-and their communities-must adopt ever-greater
   economies of scale to remain competitive with growing/consolidating
   foreign farm producers. All ecological issues associated with farms
   (organic wastes, parasites, toxins use, escapes etc.) are density
   dependant and therefore escalation of production results in
   incrementally greater ecological impacts. Further, the (d-)evolution of
   salmon from a culturally iconic seasonal delicacy and cultural keystone
   species of indigenous communities to a low-value global commodity has
   manifested a broad array of impacts highlighting the codependence of
   ecology, culture, and economics in coastal communities. Finally,
   increasing production increases supply, which in turn lowers price and
   alters consumer expectations of price/value relationships. This not only
   forces another round of production increases/consolidation on the farm,
   but also drives out commercial fishermen, particularly smaller
   owner/operators, who have no capacity to adopt economies of scale in the
   face of falling salmon prices. The ensuing rationalization process
   results in corporate fleets, the only model capable of adapting to the
   economic realities of the commoditization of salmon. Such loss of
   sovereignty effectively liquidates social capital of coastal communities
   which is instead invested into corporate machinery paying a lower rate
   of return far removed from the communities who are now left to pay off
   the interest as a legacy to the venture.},

Abstract = {The pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was experimentally exposed to the
   neurotoxic Alexandrium catenella and a non-producer of PSTs, Alexandrium
   tamarense (control algae), at concentrations corresponding to those
   observed during the blooming period. At fixed time intervals, from 0 to
   48 h, we determined the clearance rate, the total filtered cells, the
   composition of the fecal ribbons, the profile of the PSP toxins and the
   variation of the expression of two a-amylase and triacylglecerol lipase
   precursor (TLP) genes through semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results
   showed a significant decrease of the clearance rate of C. gigas fed with
   both Alexandrium species. However, from 29 to 48 h, the clearance rate
   and cell filtration activity increased only in oysters fed with A.
   tamarense. The toxin concentrations in the digestive gland rose above
   the sanitary threshold in less than 48 h of exposure and GTX6, a
   compound absent in A. catenella cells, accumulated. The a-amylase B gene
   expression level increased significantly in the time interval from 6 to
   48 h in the digestive gland of oysters fed with A. tamarense, whereas
   the TLP gene transcript was significantly up-regulated in the digestive
   gland of oysters fed with the neurotoxic A. catenella. All together,
   these results suggest that the digestion capacity could be affected by
   PSP toxins.},

Title = {Uptake and depuration of anatoxin-a by the mussel Mytilus

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms tend to be more common in warm and
   nutrient-enriched waters and are increasing in many aquatic water bodies
   due to eutrophication. The aim of this work is to study the accumulation
   and deputation of anatoxin-a by Mytilus galloprovincialis a widespread
   distributed mussel living in estuarine and coastal waters and recognized
   worldwide as a bioindicator (e.g. Mussel Watch programs). Research on
   the distribution and biological effects of anatoxin-a in M.
   galloprovincialis is important. Nevertheless, the risk of human
   intoxication due to the consumption of contaminated bivalves should also
   be considered. A toxic bloom was simulated in an aquarium with 5 x 10(5)
   cell ml(-1) of Anabaena sp. (ANA 37), an anatoxin-a producing strain.
   Mussels were exposed to Anabaena for 15 days and then 15 days of
   depuration followed. Three or more animals were sampled every 24 h for
   total toxin quantification and distribution in soft tissues (edible
   parts). Water samples were also taken every 24 h in order to calculate
   total dissolved and particulate anatoxin-a concentrations. Anatoxin-a
   was quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. No deaths occurred
   during accumulation and depuration periods. One day after the beginning
   of deputation, the toxin could not be detected in the animals.
   Anatoxin-a is distributed in the digestive tract, muscles and foot and
   is probably actively detoxified. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The protective effect of chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) and its
   antigen-binding FAb' fragments was studied by their neutralization of
   heat-labile toxin (LT) produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
   (ETEC) strain H10407. High levels of specific antibodies against LT were
   produced and maintained over a period of 8 months in eggs of
   hyper-immunized hens. The FAb' fragment produced by peptic digestion was
   found to be as effective as the whole IgY molecule in neutralizing LT.
   Removal of the enterotoxin-specific antibodies eliminated the
   neutralization activities of both IgY and the FAb' fragment. Heat
   pasteurization at 65 degrees C for 15 min and presence of high salt (1.5
   M-NaCl) at pH 7.0 did not change the neutralization activities of either
   IgY or FAb'. Although incubation at pH of 2.0 for 4 h led to a 16-fold
   decrease in the neutralization activities of IgY and FAb', substantial
   neutralization activities were retained. The combination of low pH and
   high salt content, however, resulted in the complete destruction of the
   neutralization activity of IgY, but not the FAb' fragment.},

Title = {Prevalence and Whole-Genome Sequence-Based Analysis of Shiga
   Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli Isolates from the Recto-Anal
   Junction of Slaughter-Age Irish Sheep},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) organisms are a diverse
   group of pathogenic bacteria capable of causing serious human illness,
   and serogroups O157 and O26 are frequently implicated in human disease.
   Ruminant hosts are the primary STEC reservoir, and small ruminants are
   important contributors to STEC transmission. This study investigated the
   prevalence, serotypes, and shedding dynamics of STEC, including the
   supershedding of serogroups O157 and O26, in Irish sheep. Recto-anal
   mucosal swab samples (n = 840) were collected over 24 months from two
   ovine slaughtering facilities. Samples were plated on selective agars
   and were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed via real-time PCR
   (RT-PCR) for Shiga toxin prevalence and serogroup. A subset of STEC
   isolates (n = 199) were selected for whole-genome sequencing and
   analyzed in silico. In total, 704/840 (83.8\%) swab samples were Shiga
   toxin positive following RT-PCR screening, and 363/704 (51.6\%) animals
   were subsequently culture positive for STEC. Five animals were shedding
   STEC O157, and three of these were identified as supershedders. No STEC
   O26 was isolated. Post hoc statistical analysis showed that younger
   animals are more likely to harbor STEC and that STEC carriage is most
   prevalent during the summer months. Following sequencing, 178/199
   genomes were confirmed as STEC. Thirty-five different serotypes were
   identified, 15 of which were not yet reported for sheep. Serotype
   O91:H14 was the most frequently reported. Eight Shiga toxin gene
   variants were reported, two stx1 and six stx2, and three novel
   Shiga-toxin subunit combinations were observed. Variant stx(1c) was the
   most prevalent, while many strains also harbored stx(2b).
   IMPORTANCE Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) bacteria are
   foodborne, zoonotic pathogens of significant public health concern. All
   STEC organisms harbor stx, a critical virulence determinant, but it is
   not expressed in most serotypes. Sheep shed the pathogen via fecal
   excretion and are increasingly recognized as important contributors to
   the dissemination of STEC. In this study, we have found that there is
   high prevalence of STEC circulating within sheep and that prevalence is
   related to animal age and seasonality. Further, sheep harbor a variety
   of non-O157 STEC, whose prevalence and contribution to human disease
   have been underinvestigated for many years. A variety of Stx variants
   were also observed, some of which are of high clinical importance.},

Abstract = {Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (Group 1)
   seriously impacted the Tasmanian shellfish industry during 2012 and
   2015, necessitating product recalls and intensive paralytic shellfish
   toxin (PST) product testing. The performance of four commercial PST test
   kits, Abraxis (TM), Europroxima (TM), Scotia (TM) and Neogen (TM), was
   compared with the official AOAC LC-FLD method for contaminated mussels
   and oysters. Abraxis and Europroxima kits underestimated PST in 35-100\%
   of samples when using standard protocols but quantification improved
   when concentrated extracts were further diluted (underestimation <=
   18\%). The Scotia kit (cut off 0.2-0.7 mg STX-diHCI eq/kg) delivered 0\%
   false negatives, but 27\% false positives. Neogen produced 5\% false
   negatives and 13\% false positives when the cut off was altered to
   0.5-0.6 mg STX-diHCl eq/kg, the introduction of a conversion step
   eliminated false negatives. Based on their sensitivity, ease of use and
   performance, the Neogen kit proved the most suitable kit for use with
   Tasmanian mussels and oysters. Once formally validated for regulatory
   purposes, the Neogen kit could provide shellfish growers with a rapid
   tool for harvesting decisions at the farm gate. Effective rapid
   screening preventing compliant samples undergoing testing using the more
   expensive and time consuming LC-FLD method will result in significant
   savings in analytical costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Mitigation of fish-killing algal toxins by clay minerals offers great
   promise as an emergency strategy for fish farms threatened by harmful
   algal blooms, but its efficiency is highly clay and algal species (i.e.
   ichthyotoxin) specific. We here screened several different clay types
   (kaolin, zeolite, Korean loess and six bentonites) for their adsorptive
   capacity of extracellular Karlodinium veneficum and Karenia mikimotoi
   ichthyotoxins as quantified with the rainbow trout RTgill-W1 cell line
   assay. Treatment with Korean loess, zeolite (0-0.5 g L - 1),
   polyaluminium chloride (0-0.1 g L (- 1)) and clays modified with this
   flocculant (0-0.25 g L (- 1)) could not significantly improve gill cell
   viability compared to toxic controls. Kaolin only demonstrated effective
   removal in case of K. mikimotoi, but concentrations required for
   complete removal of cytotoxicity were at least 2 x those required for
   bentonite. Bentonites of high swelling capacity and ideally small
   particle size (<2 mu m) proved best suited for ichthyotoxin removal
   against both algal species (100\% removal at concentrations as low as
   0.1 g L (- 1)). Complete elimination of K. veneficum and K. mikimotoi
   toxicity towards the rainbow trout gill cell line was achieved by
   bentonite clay, demonstrating the potential to control ichthyotoxicity
   in an aquaculture setting through targeted clay application.},

Abstract = {Karenia selliformis strain GM94GAB was isolated in 1994 from the north
   of Sfax, Gabes gulf, Tunisia. This species, which produces gymnodimine
   (GYM) a cyclic imine, has since been responsible for chronic
   contamination of Tunisian clams. A study was made by culturing the
   microalgae oil enriched Gaillard f/2 medium. The influence of growing
   conditions oil toxin content was studied, examining the effects of (i)
   different culture Volumes (0.25 to 40 litre flasks), (ii) two
   temperature ranges (17-15 degrees C et 20-21 degrees C) and (iii) two
   salinities (36 and 44). Chemical analyses were made by mass spectrometry
   coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS). Results showed that (i)
   the highest growth rate (0.34 +/- 0.14 div d(-1)) was obtained at 20
   degrees C and a salinity of 36, (ii) GYM content expressed as pg eq GYM
   cell(-1) increased with Culture time. The neurotoxicity of K.
   selliformis extracts was confirmed by mouse bioassay. This study allowed
   us to calculate the minimal lethal dose (MLD) of gymnodimine (GYM) that
   kills a mouse, as a function of the number of K. selliformis cells
   extracted.},

Abstract = {Nassarius has caused serious people poisoning and death incident as a
   popular food due to tetrodotoxin (TTX) accumulation in their body.
   Understanding the genetic basis of tetrodotoxin (TTX) transformation and
   resistance in animals could lead to significant insights into adaptive
   evolution to toxins and toxin poisoning cures in medicine. Here we
   performed comparative transcriptome analysis for toxic and non-toxic
   communities in Nassarius succinctus and Nassarius variciferus to reveal
   their genetic expression and mutation patterns. For both species, the
   cellular and metabolic process, and binding and catalytic activity
   accounted for the top classification categories, and the toxic
   communities generally produced more up-regulated genes than non-toxic
   communities. Most unigenes and different expression genes were related
   to disease, e.g., heat shock protein and tissue factor pathway
   inhibitors, which involve detoxification and coagulation. In mutation
   levels, the sodium channel gene of N. succinctus had one amino acid
   mutation ``L{''}, which is different from that of other animals. In
   conclusion, the comparative transcriptome analysis of different species
   and populations provided an important genetic basis for adaptive
   evolution to toxins, health and toxin poisoning cure research for TTX in
   marine gastropoda mollusk. Future studies will focus on the action
   mechanism of the important functional gene for TTX accumulation and

Title = {Pathogenic impact of Vibrio spp. in scallop hemolymph:
   Implications for health in aquaculture},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {605},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The dynamics of the host-pathogen relationship are crucial for the
   success of marine bivalve aquaculture. Several Vibrio bacteria have been
   identified as pathogenic for scallops. This study covered eight months
   of monitoring of Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph of the scallop Argopecten
   purpuratus under culture conditions. Following the isolation of
   culturable Vibrio spp. and their taxonomic assignation, their pathogenic
   potential was estimated through experimental infections and cytotoxicity
   assays. The main findings were that: (i) scallops exhibit a low load of
   Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph, though these loads increase between late
   winter and early spring; (ii) the identified strains belong to the
   Splendidus, Pectenicida, and Rumoiensis clades, with the Splendidus
   clade being predominant, and Vibrio lentus being the most common species
   among them; and (iii) a high proportion of strains (86\%) exhibited
   production of virulence factors, with four strains showing significant
   cytotoxic activity on scallop primary cultures of hemocytes. Two of the
   most virulent Vibrio isolates were confirmed as V. crassostreae HO115
   and V. toranzoniae HO139 through genome sequencing. These isolates were
   then used for immune challenges of juvenile and adult scallops. The
   juvenile scallops were more affected by both vibrios compared to the
   adults. The juveniles showed exacerbated immune responses, a low
   capacity to eliminate Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph, and mortality rates
   of 26-40\% after exposure. The most prevalent virulence-related genes in
   the genomes of V. crassostreae HO115 and V. toranzoniae HO139 included
   toxins, tissue-degrading enzymes, adhesion structures and immune evasion
   mechanisms. Notably, the virulence-related protein R5.7 is present in V.
   toranzoniae HO139 but absent in V. crassostreae HO115. Additionally, V.
   crassostreae HO115 featured a Type VI secretion system (T6SS) and a
   putative plasmid similar to the pathogenic plasmid pGV1512 which
   contains plasmid partitioning genes (parA/B), a conjugative apparatus
   (tra), transposases, and a heavy metal resistance cluster (cus/cop),
   strongly suggesting the presence of an extrachromosomal mobilizable
   element in V. crassostreae HO115. These findings establish a baseline
   for understanding the potential impact of Vibrio spp. present in scallop
   hemolymph. Evaluating in future environmental contexts could enhance our
   ability to predict how these Vibrio species will affect scallop health
   and propose solutions to mitigate these effects.},

Title = {Effects of Cyanobacterial Lipopolysaccharides from Microcystis on

   rerio) Embryo},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria ({''}blue-green algae{''}) are recognized producers of a
   diverse array of toxic secondary metabolites. Of these, the
   lipopolysaccharides (LPS), produced by all cyanobacteria, remain to be
   well investigated. In the current study, we specifically employed the
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo to investigate the effects of LPS from
   geographically diverse strains of the widespread cyanobacterial genus,
   Microcystis, on several detoxifying enzymes/pathways, including
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase
   (GPx)/glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and
   catalase (CAT), and compared observed effects to those of heterotrophic
   bacterial (i.e., E. coli) LPS. In agreement with previous studies,
   cyanobacterial LPS significantly reduced GST in embryos exposed to LPS
   in all treatments. In contrast, GPx moderately increased in embryos
   exposed to LPS, with no effect on reciprocal GR activity. Interestingly,
   total glutathione levels were elevated in embryos exposed to Microcystis
   LPS, but the relative levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione (i.e.,
   GSH/GSSG) were, likewise, elevated suggesting that oxidative stress is
   not involved in the observed effects as typical of heterotrophic
   bacterial LPS in mammalian systems. In further support of this, no
   effect was observed with respect to CAT or SOD activity. These findings
   demonstrate that Microcystis LPS affects glutathione-based
   detoxification pathways in the zebrafish embryo, and more generally,
   that this model is well suited for investigating the apparent
   toxicophore of cyanobacterial LPS, including possible differences in
   structure-activity relationships between heterotrophic and
   cyanobacterial LPS, and teleost fish versus mammalian systems.},

Abstract = {The causative dinoflagellate blooms of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
   and changes in the toxin contents and the profiles in both arc shell
   Scapharca broughtonii and Japanese cockle Fulvia mutica in Osaka Bay for
   three years from 2013 to 2015 were investigated. During the
   investigation, the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense and A.
   catenella occurred in Osaka Bay. A. tamarense was the most important
   causative species in contamination of bivalves with PSTs. Contamination
   and detoxification in arc shell with PSTs were slower than those in
   Japanese cockle and slight amounts of PSTs remained in the arc shell
   throughout the year. On the other hand, PSTs in Japanese cockle were not
   detected after the end of bloom of A. tamarense. The dominant toxins of
   arc shell were GTX2 and GTX3 and relative ratio of STX in the arc shell
   increased with decontamination of toxins. In contrast, the dominant
   toxins in Japanese cockle were C1 and C2. In conclusion, the rate of
   GTX1 and GTX4 increased during the bloom of A. tamarense in both
   species. It was suggested that toxins in Japanese cockle were rapidly
   excreted without any in vivo conversions of toxins from the causative
   dinoflagellates.},

Title = {Biotransformation of phytoestrogens from soy in enzymatically
   characterized liver microsomes and primary hepatocytes of Atlantic
   salmon},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},

Abstract = {Efficient aquaculture is depending on sustainable protein sources. The
   shortage in marine raw materials has initiated a shift to ``green
   aquafeeds{''} based on staple ingredients such as soy and wheat.
   Plant-based diets entail new challenges regarding fish health, product
   quality and consumer risks due to the possible presence of chemical
   contaminants, natural toxins and bioactive compounds like
   phytoestrogens. Daidzein (DAI), genistein (GEN) and glycitein (GLY) are
   major soy isoflavones with considerable estrogenic activities,
   potentially interfering with the piscine endocrine system and affecting
   consumers after carry-over. In this context, information on isoflavone
   biotransformation in fish is crucial for risk evaluation. We have
   therefore isolated hepatic fractions of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar),
   the most important species in Norwegian aquaculture, and used them to
   study isoflavone elimination and metabolite formation. The salmon liver
   microsomes and primary hepatocytes were characterized with respect to
   phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) and phase II
   uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) enzyme activities
   using specific probe substrates, which allowed comparison to results in
   other species. DAI, GEN and GLY were effectively cleared by UGT. Based
   on the measurement of exact masses, fragmentation patterns, and
   retention times in liquid chromatography high-resolution mass
   spectrometry, we preliminarily identified the 7-O-glucuronides as the
   main metabolites in salmon, possibly produced by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9-like
   activities. In contrast, the production of oxidative metabolites by CYP
   was insignificant. Under optimized assay conditions, only small amounts
   of mono-hydroxylated DAI were detectable. These findings suggested that
   bioaccumulation of phytoestrogens in farmed salmon and consumer risks
   from soy-containing aquafeeds are unlikely.},

Title = {Antidiarrheal activity of a novel sulfated polysaccharide from the red
   seaweed Gracilaria cervicornis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: The use of marine seaweeds as a source
   of natural compounds with medicinal purposes is increasing in Western
   countries in the last decades, becoming an important alternative in the
   traditional medicine of many developing countries, where diarrhea still
   remains a severe public health problem, with high rates of mortality and
   morbidity. Sulfated polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from red seaweeds
   can exhibit therapeutic effects for the treatment of gastrointestinal
   disorders. Thus, the pharmacological properties of the PLS from
   Gracilaria cervicornis, an endemic seaweed found in the Brazilian
   northeast coast, was evaluated as an alternative natural medication for
   diarrhea.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the antidiarrheal
   activity of sulfated polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from the red
   seaweed G. cervicornis in Swiss mice pre-treated with castor oil or
   cholera toxin.
   Materials and methods: The seaweed Gracilaria cervicornis was collected
   at Flecheiras beach (city of Trairi, State of Ceara, Brazil) and the PLS
   was obtained through enzymatic extraction and administered in mice
   (25-30 g) before diarrhea induction with castor oil or cholera toxin.
   For the evaluation of the total number of fecal output and diarrheal
   feces, the animals were placed in cages lined with adsorbent material.
   The evaluation of intestinal fluid accumulation (enteropooling) on
   castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice occurred by dissecting the small
   intestine and measuring its volume. The determination of Na+/K+-ATPase
   activity was measured in the small intestine supernatants by
   colorimetry, using commercial biochemistry kits. The gastrointestinal
   motility was evaluated utilizing an activated charcoal as a food tracer.
   The intestinal fluid secretion and chloride ion concentration were
   evaluated in intestinal closed loops in mice with cholera toxin-induced
   secretory diarrhea. The binding ability of PLS with GM1 and/or cholera
   toxin was evaluated by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELBA).
   Results: The G. cervicornis PLS showed antidiarrheal effects in both
   acute and secretory diarrhea, reducing the total number of fecal output,
   diarrheic stools, intestinal fluid accumulation, and increasing small
   intestine Na+/K+-ATPase activity on castor oil-induced diarrhea.
   However, the PLS did not affect gastrointestinal motility, indicating
   that this compound has a different action mechanism than loperamide. In
   secretory diarrhea, the PLS decreased intestinal fluid secretion and
   small intestine chloride excretion, binding with GM1 and/or cholera
   toxin and blocking their attachment to the enterocyte cell surface.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, PLS has a significant antidiarrheal effect
   in acute and secretory diarrhea. Further investigation is needed towards
   its use as a natural medicine to treat diarrhea.},

Abstract = {Gastric cancer is a pathological condition induced by the bacteria
   Helicobacter pylori. Targeting the key virulence factors of H. pylori
   causing gastric cancer is a promising method for treating gastric
   cancer. Recently, research has been focused on analyzing the adrenergic,
   cholinergic, and anti-cancer properties of their venom proteins. Testing
   the anti-cancer activity of the lethal proteins in the venom of P.
   volitans provides a bioactive compound for cancer treatment. Still, it
   is also helpful to eliminate the ecological imbalance caused by these
   fish in the marine environment. This study focuses on an in silico
   approach using Z-dock to analyze the bioactive prospective of the venom
   proteins of P. volitans against the essential virulence proteins of H.
   pylori responsible for inducing cancer. Our in silico docking study
   using a computational model of the venom proteins and H. pylori proteins
   has displayed the possible interactions between these proteins. The
   results revealed that P. volitans hyaluronidase and PV toxin's venom
   proteins effectively interact with H. pylori proteins Cag A, Cag L, GGT,
   Cag D, and urease that may be promising proteins in cancer therapy.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {With over 600 valid species, the wrasses (family Labridae) are among the
   largest and most successful families of the marine teleosts. They
   feature prominently on coral reefs where they are known not only for
   their impressive diversity in colouration and form but also for their
   functional specialisation and ability to occupy a wide variety of
   trophic guilds. Among the wrasses, the parrotfishes (tribe Scarini)
   display some of the most dramatic examples of trophic specialisation.
   Using abrasion-resistant biomineralized teeth, parrotfishes are able to
   mechanically extract protein-rich micro-photoautotrophs growing in and
   among reef carbonate material, a dietary niche that is inaccessible to
   most other teleost fishes. This ability to exploit an otherwise untapped
   trophic resource is thought to have played a role in the diversification
   and evolutionary success of the parrotfishes. In order to better
   understand the key evolutionary innovations leading to the success of
   these dietary specialists, we sequenced and analysed the genome of a
   representative species, the spotted parrotfish (Cetoscarus ocellatus).
   We find significant expansion, selection and duplications within several
   detoxification gene families and a novel poly-glutamine expansion in the
   enamel protein ameloblastin, and we consider their evolutionary
   implications. Our genome provides a useful resource for comparative
   genomic studies investigating the evolutionary history of this highly
   specialised teleostean radiation.},

Abstract = {Individuals of Mytilus chilensis with different histories of exposure to
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) were exposed to a diet containing
   the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Feeding and
   intoxication-detoxification dynamics were evaluated over a period of
   12-16 days. Feeding activity was reduced during the first days of
   exposure, followed by a period of recovery from day 5 to the end of the
   experiment. Mussels from Corral population (no history of PSP exposure)
   exceeded the concentration of 80 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1) tissue, although
   filtration activity was significantly lower compared with individuals
   from Melinka (frequent PSP exposure). The higher feeding activity and
   the lower degree of toxin accumulation in the Melinka population appear
   be associated with frequent exposure to PSP in the natural environment.
   The use of A. catenella as food resource and the capacity of a rapid
   intoxication of both populations showed that M. chilensis is an adequate
   indicator for early detection of PSP.},

Abstract = {Our previous studies demonstrated that the ichthyotoxic Chattonella
   marina stimulated proliferation of branchial chloride cell (CC) and
   induced osmotic distress akin to hyperactive elimination of ions in fish
   (Rhabdosargus sarba). To ascertain the in vivo effects of C marina on
   key CC ion transporters, the localization and expression of Na+,
   K+-ATPase (NKA) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
   (CFTR) proteins in response to C. marina exposure were investigated,
   using a quantitative immunocytochemical approach. The polarized
   distributions of NKA (a subunit) and CFTR proteins in branchial CCs of
   R. sarba remained unchanged under C. marina exposure. However,
   significant inductions of these two ion-transporters were detected in
   CCs of fish after 6 h exposure. By real-time PCR, no significant changes
   in gill NKA and CFTR mRNA expressions were detected, suggesting a
   post-transcriptional pathway is likely involved in regulating the ion
   transporters abundance. This study is the first to demonstrate the in
   vivo effects of harmful algal toxin on NKA and CFTR protein expressions
   in gill transepithelial cells. Taken together, an augmentation of
   branchial CCs together with hyper-stimulation of NKA and CFTR in CCs
   attribute to the rapid development of osmotic distress in C marina
   susceptible fish. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Characteristics and Function of Sulfur Dioxygenase in Echiuran Worm
   Urechis unicinctus},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {Background: Sulfide is a common toxin to animals and is abundant in
   coastal and aquatic sediments. Sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) is thought to be
   the key enzyme involved in sulfide oxidation in some organisms. The
   echiuran worm, Urechis unicinctus, inhabits coastal sediment and
   tolerates high concentrations of sulfide. The SDO is presumably
   important for sulfide tolerance in U. unicinctus.
   Results: The full-length cDNA of SDO from the echiuran worm U.
   unicinctus, proven to be located in the mitochondria, was cloned and the
   analysis of its sequence suggests that it belongs to the
   metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. The enzyme was produced using an E.
   coli expression system and the measured activity is approximately 0.80 U
   mg protein(-1). Furthermore, the expression of four sub-segments of the
   U. unicinctus SDO was accomplished leading to preliminary identification
   of functional domains of the enzyme. The identification of the conserved
   metal I (H113, H115, H169 and D188), metal II (D117, H118, H169 and
   H229) as well as the potential glutathione (GSH) (R197, Y231, M279 and
   I283) binding sites was determined by enzyme activity and GSH affinity
   measurements. The key residues responsible for SDO activity were
   identified by analysis of simultaneous mutations of residues D117 and
   H118 located close to the metal II binding site.
   Conclusion: The recombinant SDO from U. unicinctus was produced,
   purified and characterized. The metal binding sites in the SDO were
   identified and Y231 recognized as the mostly important amino acid
   residue for GSH binding. Our results show that SDO is located in the
   mitochondria where it plays an important role in sulfide detoxification
   of U. unicinctus.},

Title = {Rapid and sensitive detection of Karlodinium veneficum
   using RAA and CRISPR-Cas12a technologies},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The harmful algal species Karlodinium veneficum (K. veneficum) poses a
   significant threat to aquatic ecosystems, economic stability, and human
   health due to its toxin production and widespread occurrence. Rapid
   climatic changes and eutrophication have intensified harmful algal
   blooms (HABs), making the timely detection of K. veneficum critical. To
   address this need, we developed a rapid and accurate detection method of
   K. veneficum by combining Recombinase Aided Amplification (RAA) with
   CRISPR/LbCas12a. This method targets the internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) sequence of K. veneficum and utilizes the ``collateral
   activity{''} of CRISPR/LbCas12a for visualization. Our method can detect
   plasmid DNA as low as 5.9 x 102 copies/mu L and genomic DNA as low as
   3.6 x 10-2 ng/mu L, achieving a detection limit of 10 cells of K.
   veneficum through a simplified DNA extraction process. The entire
   detection process, from DNA crude extract to result visualization, can
   be completed in as fast as 90 min, making it suitable for field
   applications requiring a rapid response. In addition, our method was
   validated against a wide range of non-target microalgae species,
   confirming its specificity to K. veneficum and eliminating the risk of
   cross-reactivity. Overall, the RAA-CRISPR/LbCas12a system is simple,
   accurate, and sensitive, showing great potential for field applications
   in monitoring K. veneficum.},

   seasonal distribution and bacterial production in the St Lawrence

Abstract = {We determined the seasonal distribution of paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs) and PST producing bacteria in > 15, 5-15, and 0.22-5 mum size
   fractions in the St Lawrence. We also measured PSTs in a local
   population of Mytilus edulis. PST concentrations were determined in each
   size fraction and in laboratory incubations of sub-samples by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), including the rigorous
   elimination of suspected toxin `imposter' peaks. Mussel toxin levels
   were determined by mouse bioassay and HPLC. PSTs were detected in all
   size fractions during the summer sampling season, with 47\% of the water
   column toxin levels associated with particles smaller than Alexandrium
   tamarense (<15 mum). Even in the >15 mum size fraction, we estimated
   that as much as 92\% of PSTs could be associated with particles other
   than A. tamarense. Our results stress the importance of taking into
   account the potential presence of PSTs in size fractions other than that
   containing the known algal producer when attempting to model shellfish
   intoxication, especially during years of low cell abundance. Finally,
   our HPLC results confirmed the presence of bacteria capable of
   autonomous PST production in the St Lawrence as well as demonstrating
   their regular presence and apparent diversity in the plankton. Canadian

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial hepatotoxin accumulation in mussels (Mytilus edulis,
   Dreissena polymorpha), clam (Macoma balthica), and flounder (Platichthys
   flesus) tissues was measured. Flounder were caught with gillnets from
   the western Gulf of Finland on 21 August 1999, 25 July 2000, and 25
   August 2000. Blue mussels were collected from: (1) a steel cage at a
   depth of 3 m on 20 August 1999, (2) an enclosure at depths of 3-5 m, and
   (3) an artificial reef (wreck at 25-30 m) in the western Gulf of Finland
   between June and September 2000. Furthermore, blue mussels were
   collected from two sites between August and October 2000: south of the
   town of Hanko at depths of 5 and 20 m in the western Gulf of Finland and
   south of the city of Helsinki at a depth of 7 m in the central Gulf of
   Finland. M. balthica and D. polymorpha were collected at a depth of 12 m
   from Russian waters in the eastern Gulf of Finland on 1-4 August 2000.
   The samples were analyzed for the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins nodularin
   (NODLN) and microcystins (MCs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). ELISA indicated a time-dependent
   accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder liver up to 400 +/- 10 (SD)
   mug/kg on 25 August 2000. No hepatotoxins were detected in flounder
   muscle samples. In blue mussels, collected from an enclosure 3-5 m deep
   in the western Gulf of Finland on 23 August 2000, ELISA indicated
   cyanobacterial hepatotoxins up to 1490 +/- 60 mug/kg dry wt. Blue
   mussels collected from the other sites contained less cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins (40-130 mug/kg dry wt). Clams and mussels from Russian
   waters contained cyanobacterial hepatotoxin at about 100-130 mug/kg dry
   wt. Total hepatotoxin levels in mussels from enclosures decreased from
   August to September, indicating at least partial detoxication/depuration
   of the toxins. LC-MS verified the presence of NODLN in mussels and
   flounder. Typical detoxication conjugates were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS
   in mussel samples collected during August 2000. In deeper-living wreck
   mussels cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels continued to increase, from
   August to September, indicating that portions of cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins reach the sea floor. NODLN bioaccumulation is a constant
   phenomenon in the area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {152},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-242},
Abstract = {The response of fish larvae to the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   excavatum is reviewed based on published and new data from comparable
   experiments in which larvae were exposed to various concentrations of
   toxic A. excavatum (treatment) and nontoxic A. tamarense (control).  In
   direct intoxication experiments (larvae fed toxic cells), severity of
   symptoms, response time and toxin-related mortality (7-96\%.day-1)
   depended on species sensitivity, dinoflagellate strain toxicity and
   toxic cell concentration. In vectorial intoxication experiments
   (postlarvae fed tainted zooplankton), the mortality attributable to the
   toxins was lower and less variable. Elimination of the toxins by the
   zooplankton could limit the propagation of dinoflagellate toxins towards
   higher levels of the planktonic food web. It is concluded that the
   potential impact of A. excavatum blooms on fish survival in nature will
   be stronger during the phytophagous larval and the early postlarval
   stages when dinoflagellate cells are ingested directly. Along the
   northwest Atlantic seaboard, the threat to coastal fisheries from A.
   excavatum blooms is predicted to intensify from south to north, along a
   gradient of increasing toxicity of dinoflagellate strains.},

Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are an increasingly important source
   of pollution. Bivalves, as the main transmission medium, accumulate and
   metabolize PSTs while protecting themselves from damage. At present, the
   resistance mechanism of bivalves to PSTs is unclear. In this study,
   Mytilus galloprovincialis and Argopecten irradians were used as
   experimental shellfish species for in situ monitoring. We compared the
   inflammatory-related gene responses of the two shellfish during PSTs
   exposure by using transcriptomes. The results showed that the
   accumulation and metabolism rate of PSTs in M. galloprovincialis was
   five-fold higher than that in A. irradians. The inflammatory balance
   mechanism of M. galloprovincialis involved the co-regulation of the
   MAPK-based and AMPK-based anti-inflammatory pathways. A. irradians bore
   a higher risk of death because it did not have the balance system, and
   the regulation of apoptosis-related pathways such as the PI3K-AKT
   signaling pathway were upregulated. Taken together, the regulation of
   the inflammatory balance coincides with the ability of bivalves to cope
   with PSTs. Inflammation is an important factor that affects the
   metabolic pattern of PSTs in bivalves. This study provides new evidence
   to support the studies on the resistance mechanism of bivalves to PSTs.},

Title = {Nanoplastics Enhance Transmembrane Transport and Uptake of Carcinogens:
   Transcriptional Changes and the Effects of Weathering},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 20},
Abstract = {Nanoplastics are generated from common consumer plastics (polyethylene
   terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl
   chloride) and exposed to simulated marine weathering for up to 10 weeks.
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and zeta-potential measurements
   reveal continuous changes in the composition of the nanoplastics,
   consistent with oxidation. Although the chemical composition and
   oxidation of the nanoplastics influence their ability to sorb polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), for all investigated conditions, sorption
   of PAHs to nanoplastics achieves effective PAH concentrations that are
   orders of magnitude higher than the solubility limit in water. In an
   intestinal co-culture model membrane consisting of M cells and
   enterocytes, PAH-loaded nanoplastics enhance the overall PAH transport
   into and across the membrane, with HDPE achieving the highest
   intracellular PAH concentration. RNA sequencing of cell membranes
   exposed to nanoplastics reveals significant transcriptional changes,
   including upregulation of oxidative stress and detoxification pathways
   (NQO1, CYP1A1, CYP1B1), especially in response to PAH-loaded
   nanoplastics, while genes associated with basic cell functions, such as
   DNA repair (MACROD2) and division (KIF20A), are downregulated. These
   findings confirm the feasibility of nanoplastics to increase
   bioaccessibility and bioavailability of hydrophobic carcinogens and
   enhance cellular stress, which underscores the potential environmental
   and health impacts associated with nanoplastics as carriers of
   hydrophobic environmental toxins.},

Title = {THE INVITRO REACTION OF LIMULUS AMEBOCYTES TO BACTERIA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN},
Year = {1960},
Volume = {118},
Number = {2},
Pages = {324-337},
Abstract = {The defense mechanisms of Limulus against bacterial infection were
   studied in vitro in siliconized and unsiliconized blood culture systems
   developed for long-term amebocyte maintenance (30 days in an intact
   state and 36 days in an extended, partially de-granulated condition in
   the 2 systems respectively). Cell multiplication was not observed and
   replenishment of the medium or use of antibiotics were unnecessary. The
   pathogenicity of a Vibrio (or its thermostable toxin) for the
   siliconized (intact) system was established, for even 10-100 inoculated
   organisms could infect and destroy the cultures, persistent gel
   formation and amebocyte cytopathology being regularly demonstrable
   resultant phenomena. Using a nonpathogenic Alkaligenes- like bacterium,
   it was shown that only the siliconized cultures could rapidly (6 hr. at
   10-25{[}degree]C) and permanently eliminate large inocula (2.4 x 107
   organisms), gel formation being absent. These cultures were also active
   against several other marine bacteria. The unsiliconized and whole blood
   homogenate systems exhibited varying degrees of evanescent activity. The
   possible significance of these findings in relation to the suggestion
   that defense mechanisms against hemorrhage (gelation, clotting) and
   against infection (production of antibacterial substance or substances)
   may be intimately linked between the cellular and fluid elements of
   Limulus blood is discussed.},

Title = {Characteristics and potential human health risks of Paralytic Shellfish
   Toxins identified in eight species of bivalves from South Yellow Sea
   Mudflat},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The consumption of bivalves contaminated with paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs) poses a serious risk to human health. However, the presence of
   PSTs in bivalves from the South Yellow Sea Mudflat remains unclear. This
   study comprehensively examined the characteristics and potential health
   risks of PSTs in eight species of bivalves from the South Yellow Sea
   Mudflat across four seasons. Typical PSTs, including STX, dcNeoSTX,
   GTX1, GTX2, GTX3, and GTX4, were detected in white clams, clams,
   short-necked clams, blue mussels, razor clams, mussels, scallops, and
   oysters. Significant differences of PSTs concentrations among bivalves
   across different seasons were detected using Kruskal-Wallis tests (p <
   0.05), with the highest PSTs concentrations found in mussels (20.46 mu
   g/individual) during autumn. Furthermore, Pearson tests revealed
   significant positive correlations between PSTs concentrations and shell
   length, shell height, shell width, and soft tissue wet weight,
   indicating that larger bivalves contain higher PSTs levels. The highest
   dietary toxin intake (DTI) of PSTs across the four seasons was found in
   mussels (2.138 mu gSTX eq. kg(-)(1) bw day(-)(1)) during autumn.
   Notably, the exposure risk index (ERI) from bivalve consumption for male
   consumers was 1.23 +/- 0.819, which was higher than that for female
   consumers (1.102 +/- 0.735). The ERI of PSTs for children aged 2-7 and
   the elderly over 65 were 1.448 +/- 0.957 and 1.316 +/- 0.874,
   respectively, which were higher than those for other age groups,
   indicating that children and the elderly are more sensitive to PSTs. It
   is important to note that most ERIs of PSTs from total tissues were
   higher than 1 (potential risk), while ERIs of PSTs from non-digestive
   tissues were lower than 1, suggesting that potential health risks could
   be reduced by removing the digestive tissues of bivalves before
   consumption. This study provides valuable information for mitigating
   health risks associated with bivalve consumption.},

Title = {A Kinetic Study of Accumulation and Elimination of Microcystin-LR in
   Yellow Perch (Perca Flavescens) Tissue and Implications for Human
   Fish Consumption},

Abstract = {Fish consumption is a potential route of human exposure to the
   hepatotoxic microcystins, especially in lakes and reservoirs that
   routinely experience significant toxic Microcystis blooms. Understanding
   the rates of uptake and elimination for microcystins as well as the
   transfer efficiency into tissues of consumers are important for
   determining the potential for microcystins to be transferred up the food
   web and for predicting potential human health impacts. The main
   objective of this work was to conduct laboratory experiments to
   investigate the kinetics of toxin accumulation in fish tissue. An oral
   route of exposure was employed in this study, in which juvenile yellow
   perch (Perca flavescens) were given a single oral dose of 5 or 20 mu g
   of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) via food and accumulation in the muscle,
   liver, and tank water were measured over 24 h. Peak concentrations of
   the water soluble fraction of microcystin were generally observed 8-10 h
   after dosing in the liver and after 12-16 h in the muscle, with a rapid
   decline in both tissues by 24 h. Up to 99\% of the total recoverable
   (i.e., unbound) microcystin was measured in the tank water by 16 h after
   exposure. The relatively rapid uptake and elimination of the unbound
   fraction of microcystin in the liver and muscle of juvenile yellow perch
   within 24 h of exposure indicates that fish consumption may not be a
   major route of human exposure to microcystin, particularly in the Great
   Lakes.},

Abstract = {Adsorption-based hemoperfusion has been widely used to remove toxins
   from the blood of patients suffering acute liver failure (ALF). However,
   its detoxification effect has been severely hampered by the
   unsatisfactory adsorption performance of clinically used porous
   adsorbents, such as activated carbon (AC) and adsorption resin. Herein,
   two cage-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), PCN-333 (constructed
   from 4,4,4-s-triazine-2,4,6-triyl-tribenzoic acid (H(3)TATB) ligands and
   Al-3 metal clusters) and MOF-808 (constructed from
   1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) ligands and Zr-6 metal
   clusters), are introduced for highly efficient hemoperfusion. They
   possess negligible hemolytic activity and can act as ``bilirubin
   traps{''} to achieve outstanding adsorption performance toward
   bilirubin, a typical toxin related to ALF. Notably, PCN-333 shows a
   record-high adsorption capacity (similar to 1003.8 mg g(-1)) among
   various bilirubin adsorbents previously reported. More importantly, they
   can efficiently adsorb bilirubin in bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution
   or even in 100\% fetal bovine serum (FBS) due to their high selectivity.
   Strikingly, the adsorption rate and capacity of PCN-333 in biological
   solutions are approximately four times faster and 69 times higher than
   those of clinical AC, respectively. Findings in this work pave a new
   avenue to overcome the challenge of low adsorption efficiency and
   capacity in hemoperfusion therapy.},

Title = {Use of intravenous lipid emulsion therapy as a novel treatment for
   brevetoxicosis in sea turtles},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {The southwest coast of Florida experiences annual red tides, a type of
   harmful algal bloom that results from high concentrations of Karenia
   brevis. These dinoflagellates release lipophilic neurotoxins, known as
   brevetoxins, that bind to sodium channels and inhibit their
   inactivation, resulting in a variety of symptoms that can lead to mass
   sea turtle strandings. Traditional therapies for brevetoxicosis include
   standard and supportive care (SSC) and/or dehydration therapy; however,
   these treatments are slow-acting and often ineffective. Because red tide
   events occur annually in Florida, our objective was to test intravenous
   lipid emulsion (ILE) as a rapid treatment for brevetoxicosis in sea
   turtles and examine potential impacts on toxin clearance rates, symptom
   reduction, rehabilitation time, and survival rates. Sea turtles
   exhibiting neurological symptoms related to brevetoxicosis were brought
   to rehabilitation from 2018-2019. Upon admission, blood samples were
   collected, followed by immediate administration of 25 mg ILE/kg body
   mass (Intralipid (R) 20\%) at 1 mL/min using infusion pumps. Blood
   samples were collected at numerous intervals post-ILE delivery and
   analyzed for brevetoxins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In
   total, nine (four subadults, one adult female, four adult males)
   loggerheads (Caretta caretta), five (four juvenile, one adult female)
   Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempii), and four juvenile green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas) were included in this study. We found that plasma
   brevetoxins declined faster compared to turtles that received only SSC.
   Additionally, survival rate of these patients was 94\% (17/18), which is
   significantly higher than previous studies that used SSC and/or
   dehydration therapy (47\%; 46/99). Nearly all symptoms were eliminated
   within 24-48 h, whereas using SSC, symptom elimination could take up to
   seven days or more. The dosage given here (25 mg/kg) was sufficient for
   turtles in this study, but the use of a higher dosage (50-100 mg/kg) for
   those animals experiencing severe symptoms may be considered. These
   types of fast-acting treatment plans are necessary for rehabilitation
   facilities that are already resource-limited. Intravenous lipid emulsion
   therapy has the potential to reduce rehabilitation time, save resources,
   and increase survival of sea turtles and other marine animals
   experiencing brevetoxicosis.},

   Vulcanodinium rugosum, on human hepatic HepaRG cells},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Portimine, a recently identified cyclic imine produced by the
   dinoflagellate Vulcanodinium rugosum, has been described as a potent
   apoptotic agent in contrast to most of the cyclic imines that are
   well-known to be neurological toxins. As apoptosis can be a consequence
   of a high level of DNA lesions, we investigated the responses of
   portimine on several endpoints aimed at detecting DNA damage in the
   hepatic cell line HepaRG. Portimine induced phosphorylation of H2AX,
   which could possibly be consistent with the previously published
   induction of apoptosis with this toxin. In addition, detection of
   apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3, the induction of strand
   breaks detected by the comet assay as well as chromosome and genome
   mutations using the micronucleus assay were addressed. Surprisingly,
   portimine treatment resulted in increases in only ?H2AX in
   differentiated HepaRG cells whereas no effects on the other endpoints
   were detected. These increases in ?H2AX in the absence of genotoxic
   effects in the other tests could indicate that portimine could possibly
   induce a DNA replication stress and/or that the compound can be
   detoxified by the HepaRG cells.},

Title = {Modelling paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) transfer and accumulation in
   populations of two planktonic grazers},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A model was developed in this paper in order to study and compare the
   paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) transfer and accumulation of two
   different potential PST vectors in the planktonic community, the
   heterotrophic dinoflagellate in its red form Noctiluca scintillans and
   the copepod Acartia clausi. Different factors that influence the toxin
   transfer such as toxin synthesis, grazing on toxic and non-toxic food
   and population size of PST producers and vectors were considered in the
   model. Moreover, a laboratory experiment was conducted in order to
   calculate the detoxification rates of Noctiluca fed on Alexandrium
   catenella. According to the model results, the two grazers showed a
   significant difference mainly in the timing of the PST accumulation.
   Noctiluca exhibited a rapid response to the grazing of Alexandrium with
   high initial toxin accumulation, followed by a reduction to zero
   concentration of toxins in a period of almost two days. In contrast,
   Acartia showed a considerable delay in comparison to Noctiluca to
   accumulate the same amount of toxin in the population. This delay is
   linked to the slower reproduction rates that characterize the copepod.
   The range of the initial values used for the sensitivity analysis of the
   model is representative of the coastal environment of a Galician ria
   (embayment located at the NW of Iberian Peninsula), where the two
   grazers and Alexandrium may co-exist. The model for Acartia showed less
   sensitivity to these key parameters probably due to the time delay in
   accumulation of significant amount of toxins. Both grazers showed a
   rapid (50 h) reduction of ingested toxin, suggesting inefficiency to
   transfer toxins through predation in the food web. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Evolutionary Origin of the Interferon-Immune Metabolic Axis: The
   Sterol-Vitamin D Link},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {In vertebrate animals, the sterol metabolic network is emerging as a
   central player in immunity and inflammation. Upon infection, flux in the
   network is acutely moderated by the interferon (IFN) response through
   direct molecular and bi-directional communications. How sterol
   metabolism became linked to IFN control and for what purpose is not
   obvious. Here, we deliberate on the origins of these connections based
   on a systematic review of the literature. A narrative synthesis of
   publications that met eligibility criteria allowed us to trace an
   evolutionary path and functional connections between cholesterol
   metabolism and immunity. The synthesis supports an ancestral link
   between toxic levels of cholesterol-like products and the vitamin D
   receptor (VDR). VDR is an ancient nuclear hormone receptor that was
   originally involved in the recognition and detoxification of xenobiotic
   marine biotoxins exhibiting planar sterol ring scaffolds present in
   aquatic environments. Coadaptation of this receptor with the acquisition
   of sterol biosynthesis and IFNs in vertebrate animals set a stage for
   repurposing and linking a preexisting host-protection mechanism of
   harmful xenobiotics to become an important regulator in three key
   interlinked biological processes: bone development, immunity, and
   calcium homeostasis. We put forward the hypothesis that sterol
   metabolites, especially oxysterols, have acted as evolutionary drivers
   in immunity and may represent the first example of small-molecule
   metabolites linked to the adaptive coevolution and diversification of
   host metabolic and immune regulatory pathways.},

Volume = {81},

Abstract = {We used the whole-cell clamp and fura-2 techniques to study the membrane
   current and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) changes of
   mouse megakaryocytes in response to palytoxin (PTX), a highly potent
   marine toxin. At a holding potential of - 60 mV, PTX induced a sustained
   inward current in a dose-dependent manner. The reversal potentials
   measured in the presence of various extracellular major cations
   indicated that the PTX-induced channel had a non-selective permeability
   to alkali metal ions. Although elimination of intracellular Ca2+ had no
   effect on the PTX-induced current, removal of external Ca2+ inhibited
   the current activation. During the sustained phase of the PTX-induced
   current, treatment with ADP activated an additional current.
   Pretreatment with ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+-K+-ATPase, suppressed the
   PTX-induced current. During the stable phase of the PTX-induced current,
   challenge with NiCl2 (5 mM) or 2,4-dichlorobenzamil (DCB, 25(mu M), a
   non-selective cation channel blocker, partially reversed the current.
   Simultaneous measurement of the membrane current and {[}Ca2+](i) showed
   that PTX induced the current response without increasing the
   {[}Ca2+](i). Taken together, these results indicate that PTX induces a
   non-selective cation channel in mouse megakaryocytes. This channel is
   distinct from the ADP-operated channel and is sensitive to ouabain,
   NiCl2 and DCB.},

Abstract = {Enzymatic dehalogenation is an important and well-studied biological
   process in both the detoxification and catabolism of small molecules,
   many of which are anthro-pogenic in origin. However, dedicated
   dehalogenation reactions that replace a halogen atom with a hydrogen are
   rare in the biosynthesis of natural products. In fact, the debrominase
   Bmp8 is the only known example. It catalyzes the reductive debromination
   of the coral settlement cue and the potential human toxin
   2,3,4,5-tetrabromopyrrole as part of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic
   pentabromopseudilin. Using a combination of protein crystallography,
   mutagenesis, and computational modeling, we propose a catalytic
   mechanism for Bmp8 that is reminiscent of that catalyzed by human
   deiodinases in the maintenance of thyroid hormones. The identification
   of the key catalytic residues enabled us to recognize divergent
   functional homologues of Bmp8. Characterization of one of these
   homologues demonstrated its debromination activity even though it is
   found in a completely distinct genomic context. This observation
   suggests that additional enzymes outside those associated with the
   tetrabromopyrrole biosynthetic pathway may be able to alter the lifetime
   of this compound in the environment.},

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Organic waste has increased as the global population and economy have
   grown exponentially. Food waste (FW) is posing a severe environmental
   issue because of mismanaged disposal techniques, which frequently result
   in the squandering of carbohydrate-rich feedstocks. In an advanced
   valorization strategy, organic material in FW can be used as a viable
   carbon source for microbial digestion and hence for the generation of
   value-added compounds. In comparison to traditional feedstocks, a modest
   pretreatment of the FW stream utilizing chemical, biochemical, or
   thermochemical techniques can extract bulk of sugars for microbial
   digestion. Pretreatment produces a large number of toxins and inhibitors
   that affect bacterial fuel and chemical conversion processes. Thus, the
   current review scrutinizes the FW structure, pretreatment methods (e.g.,
   physical, chemical, physicochemical, and biological), and various
   strategies for detoxification before microbial fermentation into
   renewable chemical production. Technological and commercial challenges
   and future perspectives for FW integrated biorefineries have also been
   outlined.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Members of Prymnesium belong to the division Haptophyta, class
   Prymnesiophyceae, order Prymnesiales and family Prymnesiaceae. As most
   haptophytes, members of the genus Prymnesium are unicellular and
   planktonic. The most known of these species is the ichthyotoxic P.
   parvum, which may form nearly monospecific dense blooms in coastal and
   inland waters. This species possesses extraordinary plasticity
   concerning life survival strategies, and is specifically addressed in
   this review.
   Toxins produced by P. parvum have hemolytic properties, that not only
   kill fish but also co-existing plankton. These substances are
   allelopathic (when other algae are killed) and grazer deterrent (when
   grazers are killed). Allelopathy enables P. parvum to utilize inorganic
   nutrients present in the surrounding water without competition from
   other algal species; and by eliminating its grazers P. parvum reduces
   cell losses. The paralized microalgae and/or zooplankton, are therefter
   ingested by the P. parvum cells, a process called phagotrophy. P. parvum
   is also able of osmotrophy, i.e. utilization of dissolved organic
   matter. In this review, the cellular characteristics, life cycles, bloom
   formation, and factors affecting toxicity, allelopathy, phagotrophy, and
   osmotrophy of P. parvum are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Generalist dietary responses to individual versus combined plant toxin
   odors: an African elephant study},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {816-830},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Generalist herbivores are thought to prefer consuming combinations of
   plant toxins over singular toxins. This might not always be the case. In
   this study, we show that, when making foraging decisions, African
   elephants did not consistently prefer the odors of combinations of plant
   toxins compared to single toxins (i.e., monoterpenes). This suggests
   that the composition and diversity of volatile toxins in plants likely
   determine the effectiveness of odor-based chemical defenses against
   generalist herbivores.
   The detoxification limitation hypothesis posits that, unless plant
   defense compounds interact synergistically or additively to increase
   their harmful effects, generalist herbivores will prefer consuming
   combinations of these compounds more than singular compounds.
   Monoterpenes are odoriferous defense compounds that may be toxic to
   mammalian herbivores when ingested in sufficient quantities. Previous
   research has shown that the addition of individual monoterpenes to food
   sources reduces consumption by generalist mammalian herbivores. By using
   African elephants as a case study, we aimed to determine whether odors
   from monoterpene combinations (i.e., two or more monoterpenes) also
   deter generalist mammalian herbivory, and whether generalist herbivores
   prefer the odors of monoterpene combinations more than individual
   monoterpenes. First, we tested whether the odor of monoterpene
   combinations that resemble the monoterpene profiles of a
   high-acceptability, intermediate-acceptability, and low-acceptability
   plant deter herbivory. We found that elephants preferred plants without
   the added odors of the monoterpene combinations. Second, we explored how
   elephants responded to individual monoterpenes found within the
   combinations compared with the combinations at the same set
   concentration, and found that the elephants did not always prefer the
   combinations more than the individual monoterpenes. Moreover, the more
   diverse the combination, the less frequently it was preferred when
   compared with the individual monoterpene odors. Our results imply that
   generalist herbivores do not necessarily prefer combinations of plant
   chemical defenses at comparatively lower concentrations and that,
   consequently, the composition and diversity of monoterpene profiles in
   plants likely determine the efficacy of these compounds as an olfactory
   defense against mammalian herbivory.},

Abstract = {The development of methods facilitating the detection of cyanobacterial
   blooms in drinking water reservoirs at an early stage is of great
   importance. Fluorescence spectroscopy could meet these requirements. The
   study contains the examination of possible correlations between the
   different maxima of a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and the
   amount of produced and excreted toxins of a lab culture of Microcystis
   aeruginosa at different stages of growth. Various fluorescence signals
   (protein-like and humic-like substances, pigments) are suited for an
   estimation of cell density and actual intra- and extracellular toxin
   concentration. One signal at 315 nm/396 nm presumably originating from
   protein-like substances might be useful as a tool for the prediction of
   increasing cyanobacterial toxin concentrations. As the measurement of
   fluorescence matrices is still time consuming, synchronous scans with
   Delta lambda = 80 nm were tested as a potential alternative. They
   accurately depict the course of protein-like and humic-like fluorescence
   during the different stages of growth although especially the latter one
   is not captured at its maximum. However, due to insufficient separation
   of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin, the image of the matrix maxima by
   synchronous scans with Delta lambda = 80 nm can only be used with minor
   restrictions. Nevertheless, fluorescence spectroscopy seems to be a
   powerful tool for the evaluation of cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Gambierol is a marine polyether ladder toxin derived from the
   dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. To date, gambierol has been
   reported to act either as a partial agonist or as an antagonist of
   sodium channels or as a blocker of voltage-dependent potassium channels.
   In this work, we examined the cellular effect of gambierol on cytosolic
   calcium concentration, membrane potential and sodium and potassium
   membrane currents in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. We
   found that at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 mu M,
   gambierol-evoked {[}Ca2+]c oscillations that were dependent on the
   presence of extracellular calcium, irreversible and highly synchronous.
   Gambierol-evoked {[}Ca2+]c oscillations were completely eliminated by
   the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by riluzole and delayed by CNQX. In
   addition, the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-evoked cytosolic
   calcium oscillations in this neuronal system that were blocked by APV
   and delayed in the presence of CNQX. Electrophysiological recordings
   indicated that gambierol caused membrane potential oscillations,
   decreased inward sodium current amplitude and decreased also outward IA
   and IK current amplitude. The results presented here point to a common
   mechanism of action for gambierol and 4-AP and indicate that
   gambierol-induced oscillations in cerebellar neurons are most likely
   secondary to a blocking action of the toxin on voltage-dependent
   potassium channels and hyperpolarization of sodium current activation.

Abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB)
   known to be a highly contagious disease and is the major cause of
   mortality from a single infectious agent worldwide. Emergence of
   multi-drug resistant and extremely drug resistant strains of M.
   tuberculosis has made TB management extremely challenging eliciting the
   urgent need for alternative therapeutics. Peptide based therapeutic
   strategies are an emerging area that can be employed as a prospective
   alternative to the currently existing therapeutic regime for TB
   treatment. Here, we are reporting the anti-mycobacterial activity of two
   peptides, Tachyplesin and CyLoP-1, derived from marine horseshoe crab
   and snake toxin respectively, with potent anti-mycobacterial activity
   against various mycobacterium species. Both the peptides exhibit
   appreciable antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities against
   mycobacterium species with minimum cytotoxicity towards macrophage
   cells. They are also effective in eliminating mycobacterium cells from
   infected macrophage cells. Tachyplesin acts on mycobacterium cells in a
   lytic manner with outer membrane disruption confirmed by propidium
   iodide uptake with slight membrane depolarization and reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production. CyLoP-1, on the other hand, does not rupture
   the mycobacterium cells even at high concentrations. It seems to follow
   intracellular pathway of killing mycobacterium cells by production of
   more ROS and membrane depolarization. Both the peptides do not lead to
   apoptotic way of mycobacterium cell death. These results suggest an
   effective peptide-based antimicrobial strategy for development of future
   anti-TB therapeutics.},

Title = {Detoxification of Aflatoxin B1 by Zygosaccharomyces
   rouxii with Solid State Fermentation in Peanut Meal},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic, teratogenetic, and morbigenous
   secondary metabolites of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus that can
   contaminate multiple staple foods, such as peanut, maize, and tree nuts.
   In this study, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii was screened out and identified
   from fermented soy paste-one kind of traditional Chinese food-to
   detoxify aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) by aerobic solid state fermentation in
   peanut meal. The optimal degradation condition was chosen from single
   factor experiment, and the most effective detoxification rate was about
   97\%. As for liquid fermentation, we tested the binding ability of Z.
   rouxii, and the highest binding rate reached was 74.3\% (nonviable cells
   of Z. rouxii) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Moreover, the
   biotransformation of AFB(1) through fermentation of Z. rouxii in peanut
   meal was further verified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (LC/MS). According to TIC scan, after fermentation by Z. rouxii, the
   AFB(1) in peanut meal was prominently degraded to the lowering peaks of
   AFB(1). Additionally, m/s statistics demonstrated that AFB(1) may be
   degraded to some new products whose structural properties may be
   different from AFB(1), or the degradation products may be dissolved in
   the aqueous phase rather than the organic phase. As far as we know, this
   is the first report indicating that the safe strain of Z. rouxii has the
   ability to detoxify AFB(1).},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) can be dangerous to food security or even cause
   death. But TTX also has beneficial values, for example in clinical
   applications and drug discovery, it is used to treat arthritis, asthma
   and as a pain relievers. A clear understanding of the source, ecological
   function, toxicity, and resistance mechanisms of TTX in animals is
   beneficial for ecological protection, the prediction of adaptive
   evolution, and TTX production. Nevertheless, the origin of TTX and how
   organisms bearing TTX are able to resist its toxicity are still unclear.
   There are two hypotheses regarding the source of TTX in TTX-containing
   organisms: exogenous and endogenous sources. Bacteria are involved in
   both hypotheses. In addition, the presence of TTX-binding proteins and
   mutations in the gene encoding for voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav)
   may be responsible for TTX resistance, which remains to be elucidated.
   Here, we review the ecological interactions between TTX and TTX-bearing
   organisms. This review provides important information for ecological
   research on TTX, along with suggestions for scientific prevention of
   seafood poisoning and the development of TTX detoxification drugs.},

Abstract = {The demand for valuable products from dinoflagellate biotechnology has
   increased remarkably in recent years due to their many prospective
   applications. However, there remain many challenges that need to be
   addressed in order to make dinoflagellate bioactives a commercial
   reality. In this article, we describe the technical feasibility of
   producing and recovering amphidinol analogues (AMs) excreted into a
   culture broth of Amphidinium carterae ACRN03, successfully cultured in
   an LED-illuminated pilot-scale (80 L) bubble column photobioreactor
   operated in fed-batch mode with a pulse feeding strategy. We report on
   the isolation of new structurally related AMs, amphidinol 24 (1, AM24),
   amphidinol 25 (2, AM25) and amphidinol 26 (3, AM26), from a singular
   fraction resulting from the downstream processing. Their planar
   structures were elucidated by extensive NMR and HRMS analysis, whereas
   the relative configuration of the C-32 -> C-47 bis-tetrahydropyran core
   was confirmed to be antipodal in accord with the recently revised
   configuration of AM3. The hemolytic activities of the new metabolites
   and other related derivatives were evaluated, and structure-activity
   conclusions were established. Their isolation was based on a
   straightforward and high-performance bioprocess that could be suitable
   for the commercial development of AMs or other high-value compounds from
   shear sensitive dinoflagellates.},

Abstract = {The accumulation of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in bivalves is
   species specific. We compared the physiological responses and the toxin
   profiles in tissues of the burrowing surf clam, Paphies donacina, and
   the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, exposed to the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Bivalves were supplied with the
   toxic algae for 10 days, then allowed a detoxification period of 8 days.
   Clearance rates of mussels and clams were similar when fed either with
   toxic A. tamarense or non-toxic A. margalefi. Byssus production in the
   mussel was inhibited and exhalent siphon activity in clams was erratic
   following exposure to A. tamarense. There were considerable differences
   in the toxic profile between the dinoflagellate A. tamarense, and
   tissues of the mussel and the surf clam, indicating that bioconversion
   of the PSTs had taken place. Toxin profiles of the tissues were both
   species and tissue specific. Following an 8-day detoxification period,
   total PSTs in mussels had fallen to safe concentrations below 50 mu g
   per 100g, whereas concentrations in clams remained high, with an average
   value greater than 600 mu g STX di-HCL equivalents per 100g. The results
   confirmed that mussels and clams are important monitoring organisms for
   toxic algal blooms and can be used to minimise the health risk of PSTs
   to humans.},

Abstract = {Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) infection-associated multiple
   antibiotic resistance has raised serious public health concerns.
   Recently, nanosponges (NSs) have been expected to provide innovative
   platforms for addressing antibacterial and drug-resistant challenges by
   targeting various pore-forming toxins (PFTs). In the present study, we
   constructed NSs to explore the effects and possible mechanism of
   recombinant V. vulnificus hemolysin (rVvhA)-induced injuries. In vitro,
   NSs significantly reversed rVvhA-induced apoptosis and necrosis, and
   improved toxin-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and apoptosis
   signaling pathway disruption. To explore the clinical translation
   potential of NSs, we established VvhA-induced septicemia and wound
   infection mouse models, respectively, and further found NSs could
   notably attenuate rVvhA-induced acute toxicity and septicemia-associated
   inflammation, as well as local tissue damage. In a conclusion, NSs
   showed excellent protective effects against rVvhA-induced toxicity, thus
   providing useful insights into addressing the rising threats of severe
   V. vulnificus infections.},

Title = {Environmental effects of modified clay flocculation on Alexandrium

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},

Volume = {127},

Abstract = {Among various mitigation strategies for harmful algal blooms (HABs), the
   flocculation of algal cells by using modified clay (MC) has been widely
   applied in the field, particularly in Japan, Korea and China. However,
   to examine the long-term effects and the environmental safety of this
   method, we investigated alterations in macronutrients and paralytic
   shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) induced by the application of MC
   treatment to a toxic bloom, Alexandrium tamarense. The control, algal
   cells grew in nature condition (Al), was compared to the only MC
   flocculation (A2) and the MC-sediment co-matrix systems of A. tamarense
   (A3). The low-dosage of 0.25 g L-1 MC could efficiently remove >90\% of
   the A. tamarense cells within 3.5h. The mechanisms underlying the
   effects elicited by MC flocculation on nutrient cycling, PSTs and Chl-a
   degradation were also discussed. This study demonstrated that MC
   treatment was able to significantly remove the macronutrients (43-60\%
   TP removal and 17-30\% TN removal) and scavenge most of the PSTs from
   seawater, thereby speeding up the nutrient settling and the
   transformation and degradation of PSTs (83\% decreasing in A2).
   Simultaneously, the study firstly demonstrated the potential
   detoxification of PSTs by using MC treatment, from the high toxicity of
   gonyautoxin 1 and 4 (GTX1 and GTX4) to the lower toxicity decarbamoyl
   gonyautoxins (dcGTX3) and gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2), particularly within the
   water-sediment environment during the two month incubation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Biofilms are matrix-enclosed communities that represent the most
   dominant and active mode of microbial life on Earth. Because biofilms
   are inherently more productive than any equivalent planktonic community,
   they are of great relevance to all environments they inhabit. However,
   their existence and importance are still poorly known by the general
   public, conservation practitioners and environmental policymakers. Most
   micro-organisms of multicellular organisms (including humans, animals
   and plants) occur in the form of true biofilms or biofilm-like
   structures that play vital roles in their development, physiology and
   immunity. Conversely, some biofilms can have a negative effect on host
   health. Biofilms growing on non-biological surfaces are essential
   components of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems: they form the
   basis of food webs and ensure nutrient cycling and bioremediation in
   natural systems. However, environmental biofilms can promote the
   persistence of human pathogens, produce harmful toxins, foul and corrode
   surfaces in natural and man-made settings; all of which can have
   significant health and economic implications. There is a knowledge gap
   about the roles of biofilms in the epidemiology of wildlife emerging
   infectious diseases, yet these pose a major threat to public health,
   biodiversity and sustainability. The drivers of global environmental
   change all affect biofilm structure and functions. The consequences for
   host and ecosystem health are, however, poorly understood. While the
   concept of a healthy microbiome (as opposed to dysbiosis) is emerging in
   medicine and conservation biology, the concept of a healthy biofilm
   remains to be defined in environmental sciences. Here, we use an
   integrative approach to (a) review current knowledge on the roles of
   biofilms growing on biological and non-biological interfaces for the
   health of multicellular organisms and ecosystems, and (b) provide future
   research directions to address identified knowledge gaps. Giving the
   biofilm life-form its full importance will help understand the effects
   of global environmental change on these communities and, in turn, on
   human, animal, plant and ecosystem health.},

   May 26, 2009; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00025.2009.The major thiol
   redox buffer glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, GSH) is
   central to cell fate determination, and thus, associated metabolic and
   regulatory pathways are exquisitely sensitive to a wide range of
   environmental cues. An imbalance of cellular redox homeostasis has
   emerged as a pathologic hallmark of a diverse range of human
   gene-environment disorders. Despite the central importance of GSH in
   cellular homeostasis, underlying genetic regulatory pathways remain
   poorly defined. This report describes the annotation and expression
   analysis of genes contributing to GSH homeostasis in the invertebrate
   chordate Ciona intestinalis. A core pathway comprising 19 genes
   contributing to the biosynthesis of GSH and its use as both a redox
   buffer and a conjugate in phase II detoxification as well as known
   transcriptional regulators were analyzed. These genes exhibit a high
   level of sequence conservation with corresponding human, rat, and mouse
   homologs and were expressed constitutively in tissues of adult animals.
   The GSH biosynthetic genes Gclc and Gclm were also responsive to the
   prototypical antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone. The present evidence of
   a conserved GSH homeostasis pathway in C. intestinalis together with its
   phylogenetic position as a basal chordate and lifestyle as a filter
   feeder constantly exposed to natural marine toxins introduces this
   species as an important animal model for defining molecular mechanisms
   that potentially underlie genetic susceptibility to environmentally
   associated stress.},

Abstract = {Venoms are complex mixtures of biologically active molecules that impact
   multiple physiological systems. Manufacture of antivenoms (AVs)
   therefore requires potency testing using in vivo models to ensure AV
   efficacy. As part of ongoing research to replace small animals as the
   standard model for AV potency testing, we developed an alternate in vivo
   method using the embryonated egg model (EEM). In this model, the
   survival of chicken embryos envenomated in ovo is determined prior to
   50\% gestation, when they are recognized as animals by animal welfare
   legislation. Embryos were found to be susceptible to a range of snake,
   spider, and marine venoms. This included funnel-web spider venom for
   which the only other vertebrate, non-primate animal model is newborn
   mice. Neutralization of venom with standard AV allowed correlation of AV
   potency results from the EEM to results from animal assays. Our findings
   indicate that the EEM provides an alternative, insensate in vivo model
   for the assessment of AV potency. The EEM may enable reduction or
   replacement of the use of small animals, as longer-term research that
   enables the elimination of animal use in potency testing continues.},

Abstract = {In marine and estuarine conditions, pH-dependent aquatic toxicity
   associated with Prymnesium parvum has been previously demonstrated with
   greater toxicity observed at higher pH. Recent research by our group
   extended such observations to inland waters in Texas, USA. Because
   prymnesins (prymnesin-1, prymnesin-2) represent the only P. parvum
   toxins reported in the peer-reviewed literature, we hypothesized that P.
   parvum toxins may behave like weak bases in surface waters due to the
   presence of a primary amine. Employing a widely accepted computational
   model (ACD/Labs), we predicted physicochemical properties to support
   interpretation of experimental findings, specifically focusing on the
   amine-containing hydrophobic portion of these molecules. Using different
   computational models, alternative pK(a) values for prymnesins have been
   proposed by others. Herein, additional examination of our proposed
   hypothesis identifies the importance of considering subtle changes in
   ionization state on the lipophilicity, bioavailability (e.g., log D. log
   D(lip-water), Bioconcentration factor), and aquatic toxicity of
   ionizable chemicals over an environmentally-relevant pH gradient. If
   prymnesins represent causative toxins released by P. parvum as
   previously reported or if new toxins are identified in the future, a
   closer evaluation of our findings further highlights the importance of
   considering site-specific pH during environmental assessment and
   management efforts for P. parvum in inland waters. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {Two research approaches are described that were used to determine
   behavioral changes following a diet of Lake Ontario fish. Approach I
   involved the correlational method, in which human subjects voluntarily
   ate contaminated Lake Ontario fish. Demographic information, data on the
   amount of Lake Ontario fish consumed, and control variables were
   obtained during an interview. Respondents' behavior, as well as the
   behavior of their children, then was measured. Because subjects were not
   assigned randomly to eat or not eat Lake Ontario fish, other variables
   that might have influenced both consumption of fish and behavior had to
   be considered. Therefore, confounding variables were measured and their
   influence controlled for using statistical techniques. Approach 2
   involved the experimental method using laboratory rats, where subjects
   were assigned randomly to receive a diet of environmentally contaminated
   Lake Ontario salmon, relatively uncontaminated Pacific Ocean salmon, or
   no salmon. Since the rats fed Lake Ontario salmon behaved differently
   than the other two groups on nine tasks, it was concluded that the
   contaminants in Lake Ontario salmon caused behavioral changes. Random
   assignment of subjects to groups eliminated competing explanations. If
   similar behavioral (e.g., emotional or cognitive) results were obtained
   using the two approaches, then the results utilizing rats probably could
   be generalized to humans, and the correlational results found in humans
   probably were due to a cause and effect relationship.},

Abstract = {Marine cone snail venoms consist of large, naturally occurring
   combinatorial libraries of disulfide-constrained peptide neuro-toxins
   known as conotoxins, which have profound potential in the development of
   analgesics. In this study, we report a synthetic combinatorial strategy
   that probes the hypervariable regions of Conotoxin frameworks to
   discover novel analgesic agents by utilizing high diversity
   mixture-based positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries
   (PS-SCLs). We hypothesized that the direct in vivo testing of these
   mixture-based combinatorial library samples during the discovery phase
   would facilitate the identification of novel individual compounds with
   desirable antinociceptive profiles while simultaneously eliminating many
   compounds with poor activity or liabilities of locomotion and
   respiration. A PS-SCL was designed based on the alpha-conotoxin
   RgIA-Delta R n-loop region and consisted of 10,648 compounds
   systematically arranged into 66 mixture samples. Mixtures were directly
   screened in vivo using the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal
   assay, which allowed deconvolution of amino acid residues at each
   position that confer antinociceptive activity. A second generation
   library of individual alpha-conotoxin analogues was synthesized using
   systematic combinations of amino acids identified from PS-SCL
   deconvolution and further screened for antinociceptive activity. Six
   individual analogues exhibited comparable antinociceptive activity to
   that of the recognized analgesic alpha-conotoxin RgIA-Delta R, and were
   selected for further examination of antinociceptive, respiratory, and
   locomotor effects. Three lead compounds were identified that produced
   dose-dependent antinociception without significant respiratory
   depression or decreased locomotor activity. Our results represent a
   Unique approach for rapidly developing novel lead alpha-conotoxin
   analogues as low-liability analgesics with promising therapeutic
   potential.},

Title = {Mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate palytoxin-induced calcium
   influx and cytotoxicity in cultured neurons},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {152},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-266},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background and purpose: Palytoxin ( PLT) is a potent toxin that binds to
   the Na, K-ATPase. Palytoxin is highly neurotoxic and increases the
   cytosolic calcium concentration ({[} Ca2+](c)) while decreasing
   intracellular pH ( pH(i)) in neurons ( Vale et al., 2006; Vale-Gonzalez
   et al., 2007). It is also a tumour promoter that activates several
   protein kinases.
   Experimental approach: The role of different protein kinases in the
   effects of palytoxin on {[} Ca2+] c, pHi and cytoxicity was investigated
   in cultured neurons.
   Key results: Palytoxin-induced calcium load was not affected by
   inhibition of calcium-dependent protein kinase C ( PKC) isoforms but it
   was partially ameliorated by blockade of calcium-independent PKC
   isozymes. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)
   2 eliminated the palytoxin-induced rise in calcium and intracellular
   acidification, whereas inhibition of MEK greatly attenuated the
   palytoxin effect on calcium without modifying the PLT-evoked
   intracellular acidification. Blockade of c-Jun N-terminal protein
   kinases ( JNK) somewhat decreased the palytoxin-effect on calcium,
   whereas inhibition of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPKs)
   delayed the onset of the palytoxin-evoked rise in calcium and
   acidification. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of palytoxin was completely
   blocked by inhibition of ERK 2 and partially prevented by inhibition of
   MEK. PLT increased phosphorylated ERK immunoreactivity in a
   concentration-dependent manner.
   Conclusions and implications: MAPKs, specifically ERK 2, link palytoxin
   cytotoxicity with its effects on calcium homeostasis after inhibition of
   the Na, K-ATPase. Binding of palytoxin to the Na, K-ATPase would alter
   signal transduction pathways, even in non-dividing cells, and this
   finding is related to the potent neurotoxicity of this marine toxin.},

Abstract = {Amphioxus, a cephalochordate found in sand habitats in shallow in-shore
   seawaters, has been widely used as a model in comparative immunology of
   chordates. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in amphioxus under
   abiotic stress, particularly xenobiotics with strong toxicity, remains
   largely unknown. Here, a widespread marine contaminant, benzo(a)pyrene
   (BaP) is used to evaluate its toxic effects on miRNA expression of
   amphioxus. Six small RNA libraries were sequenced from Branchiostoma
   belcheri. A total of 144 known and 157 novel miRNAs were identified
   using deep sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. A total of 58
   differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were screened, including 25 up-
   and 33 down-regulated DEMs under BaP stress. Target genes possibly
   regulated by DEMs were predicted, and their functional enrichment
   analyses were performed. Targets of DEMs are primarily involved in
   xenobiotic and cellular homeostasis, catabolic and transport process.
   They could be largely linked to nine immune- and toxin
   detoxification-related pathways, including metabolism of xenobiotics by
   cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-other enzymes, and drug
   metabolism-cytochrome P450, etc. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR
   (qRT-PCR) analysis for 12 key BaP-responsive DEMs validates the accuracy
   of deep sequencing. Experiments were then conducted to investigate their
   expression responses to BaP stress at different time intervals in detail
   to further determine their expression dynamic in responses of B.
   belcheri towards BaP exposure. This study, to the best of our knowledge,
   investigates the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the toxicological
   response of amphioxus for the first time, providing valuable information
   for the protection of lone existing cephalochordate amphioxus. (C) 2018

   non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii was present at concentration:
   1500 cells ml(-1), ii) compare the effect of two temperatures (12
   degrees C and 18 degrees C) on paralytic toxin accumulation rates in
   oyster flesh by ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography
   (IP-HPLC) detection, iii) analyse toxin biotransformation during the
   contamination process, iv) evaluate the role of the different types of
   oyster tissue on the bioaccumulation mechanism.
   The results showed: i) a significant e. ect of temperature increase on
   clearance rate and toxin uptake, ii) no detectable time-related effects
   of toxic algal food on pre-ingestion sorting or on toxin profiles in
   oyster flesh, iii) either negative or positive effects of A. catenella
   concentrations on toxin uptake ({''}threshold{''} effect), iv) high
   amounts of toxins in the digestive gland, accounting for more than 80\%
   of overall shellfish toxicity. The daily amount of toxins (Q(tox)) taken
   up by each oyster was evaluated by means of a global one-compartment
   model. However a two-compartment model finally gave the best match with
   real contamination kinetics, since it integrated both toxins sequestered
   in oyster tissues and toxins moving in through the digestive tract.},

Title = {Differential Expression of the Demosponge (Suberites domuncula)
   Carotenoid Oxygenases in Response to Light: Protection Mechanism Against
   the Self-Produced Toxic Protein (Suberitine)},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The demosponge Suberites domuncula has been described to contain high
   levels of a proteinaceous toxin, Suberitine, that displays haemolytic
   activityIn the present study this 7-8 kDa polypeptide has been isolated
   and was shown to exhibit also cytotoxic effects on cells of the same
   species. Addition of retinal, a recently identified metabolite of
   beta-carotene that is abundantly present in S. domuncula was found to
   reduce both the haemolytic and the cell toxic activity of Suberitine at
   a molar ratio of 1:1. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that the
   interaction between beta-carotene and Suberitine can be ascribed to a
   reversible energy transfer reaction. The enzyme that synthesises retinal
   in the sponge system is the beta,beta-carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase
   {[}carotene dioxygenase]. In order to clarify if this enzyme is the only
   beta-carotene-metabolizing enzyme a further oxygenase had been
   identified and cloned, the (related) carotenoid oxygenase. In contrast
   to the dioxygenase, the carotenoid oxygenase could not degrade
   beta-carotene or lycopene in Escherichia coli strains that produced
   these two carotenoids; therefore it had been termed related-carotenoid
   oxygenase. Exposure of primmorphs to light of different wavelengths from
   the visible spectrum resulted after 3 days in a strong upregulation of
   the dioxygenase in those 3D-cell aggregates that had been incubated with
   beta-carotene. The strongest effect is seen with blue light at a maximum
   around 490 nm. It is concluded that the toxin Suberitine is
   non-covalently modified by retinal, the cleavage product from
   beta-carotene via the enzyme carotene dioxygenase, a light inducible
   oxygenase. Hence, this study highlights that in S. domuncula the
   bioactive metabolite, retinal, has the property to detoxify its
   homologous toxin.},

Abstract = {The cephalopods share basic features of body organisation with other
   molluscs. Characteristically, the molluscan shell is lost or highly
   reduced to an internal remnant (except in Nautilus), which in the
   sepioids still provides a buoyancy organ. Cephalopods are active mobile
   predators, swimming by means of jet propulsion and fin undulations, or
   rapidly scrambling by strong suckered arms. All cephalopods are
   predators, capturing and holding live prey with arms and tentacles
   (squids and cuttlefish). The basic feeding apparatus is a pair of tough
   horny mandibles ('beaks') and a typical molluscan radula. Octopuses have
   elaborate prey-handling mechanisms which involve injection of their prey
   with a cocktail of toxins and enzymes. Urine is formed by
   ultrafiltration, and the excretory cells surround the lateral venae
   cavae and parts of the return venous circulation. Respiration occurs
   through a pair of well-vascularised gills suspended in the mantle
   cavity. Oxygenated blood is coloured blue due to the copper-containing
   respiratory pigment haemocyanin. In addition to the muscular systemic
   heart, contractile bulbs at the base of each gill (the branchial hearts)
   and contractile blood vessels contribute to a strong blood circulatory
   system. As in other molluscs, the central nervous system is arranged
   around the oesophagus. It is highly developed and concentrated into a
   brain in which there is considerable division of function. Sense organs,
   particularly the eyes and organs of balance (statocysts), are highly
   developed. With the exception of nautiluses, all cephalopods have
   pigmented cells in the skin that are capable of expansion by muscular
   action and elastic retraction. This system of pattern formation by
   chromato-phores, coupled with luminescent organs in deep-water animals,
   the capability for expulsion of ink clouds, and their extreme ability to
   alter shape and texture contribute to making the cephalopods among the
   most scientifically exciting of marine animals to study.},

   was isolated and characterised from Foveaux Strait dredge oysters

   This study reports the results of liquid chromatographic-mass,
   spectrometric analysis for gymnodimine in 217 samples from eight species
   of shellfish over the years 1993-99. Of these samples 155, covering six
   species of shellfish, contained detectable gymnodimine with a range in
   concentration from 14.8 to 23 400 mug/kg. Gymnodimine-containing
   shellfish occurred at 37 of the 63 sites sampled from around New
   Zealand. This study demonstrates that accumulation of gymnodimine is not
   limited to T. chilensis and can occur in other shellfish species over
   much of New Zealand. Gymnodimine is a possible cause of the numerous
   historical biotoxin screen-positive results.},

Abstract = {Ostreocin-D, discovered in the past decade, is a marine toxin produced
   by dinoflagellates. It shares structure with palytoxin, a toxic compound
   responsible for the seafood intoxication named clupeotoxism. At the
   cellular level, the action sites and pharmacological effects for
   ostreocin-D are still almost unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that
   these toxins change the filamentous actin cytoskeleton, which is
   essential for multiple cellular functions. However, nothing has yet been
   reported about what happens with the unpolymerized actin pool. Here (i)
   the effects induced by ostreocin-D on unpolymerized actin, (ii) the Ca2+
   role in such a process, and (iii) the cytotoxic activity of ostreocin-D
   on the human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cell line are shown for the first
   time. Fluorescently labeled DNase I was used for staining of monomeric
   actin prior to detection with both laser-scanning cytometry and confocal
   microscopy techniques. Cellular viability was tested through a
   microplate metabolic activity assay. Ostreocin-D elicited a
   rearrangement of monomeric actin toward the nuclear region. This event
   was not accompanied by changes in its content. In addition, the presence
   or absence of external Ca2+ did not change these results. This toxin was
   also found to cause a decrease in the viability of neuroblastoma cells,
   which was inhibited by the specific blocker of Na+/K+-ATPase, ouabain.
   All these responses were comparable to those obtained with palytoxin
   under identical conditions. The data suggest that ostreocin-D modulates
   the unassembled actin pool, activating signal transduction pathways not
   related to Ca2+ influx in the same way as palytoxin.},

Title = {Variations in the toxicity and condition index of five bivalve species
   throughout a red tide event caused by Alexandrium
   catenella: A field study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Harmful red tides in China have caused paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs)
   pollution and led to severe socioeco-nomic effects in shellfish
   aquaculture. Although shellfish can survive harmful algal blooms, the
   effects on their Condition Index (CI) have been underestimated. This
   study sought to evaluate the effects of the profiles and levels of
   paralytic shellfish toxins on variations in the CI in bivalves under
   natural blooming conditions. We observed clear soft tissue lesions to
   varying degrees except in Mytilus galloprovincialis after toxin
   exposure. Among the five species of shellfish exposed in situ, only M.
   galloprovincialis accumulated PSTs content above the maximum permitted
   level (800 mu g STX di-HCl eq./kg). The highest toxin content in all
   sample tissues was observed in Patinopecten yessoensis. Significant
   interspecies differences in PSTs accumulation among the five bivalve
   species were observed in the hepatopancreas. A total of nine PSTs
   components and four new C-11 hy-droxyl metabolites (so-called M-toxins)
   toxins were detected, and detoxification diversity was observed among
   bivalves. We observed a higher proportion of M-toxin in early stages,
   and the proportions changed only slightly over time in M.
   galloprovincialis and Magallana gigas, thus accounting for the
   significantly higher metabolism rate. Notably, the CI in M. gigas and
   Argopecten irradians was positively correlated with lowest toxin
   accumulation of PSTs content, but significantly inhibited. In
   conclusion, our results revealed a significant inhibitory effect on the
   CI in shellfish, in a species specific manner, with distinct levels of
   inhibition correlated with different toxin metabolites. Our study
   revealed the toxin content of different bivalves exposed to a natural
   red tide environment and the consequent effects on growth, thus building
   a foundation for research on the mechanisms underlying the effects of
   PSTs on growth. These data establish the ecological and economic
   significance of the effects of harmful algal blooms on bivalves.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the ingestion and clearance rates of the
   heterotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans (Macartney) fed on
   the toxic microalgae Alexandrium minutum Halim in laboratory cultures.
   Specimens of the red form of N. scintillans were collected in the Rio de
   Vigo and kept in culture. The results showed that N. scintillans
   actively fed on A. minutum, with maximum ingestion rates of 0.37 mu g C
   ind(-1) day(-1), showing that there was non-satiated feeding by N.
   scintillans on A. minutum. The mean cellular toxin content of A. minutum
   in the stock culture ranged from 2.57 to 3.44 fmol cell(-1) The HPLC
   analyses of the extracts from N. scintillans fed with 4 different
   abundances of A. minutum revealed no detectable amounts of toxin. This
   suggested that although N. scintillans was able to ingest a toxic
   dinoflagellate such as A. minutum into its vacuoles, the ingested toxin
   was bioconverted or excreted by Noctiluca. Our findings support the
   theory that Noctiluca may inflict grazing pressure on the growth of
   Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) species in the field, and could
   therefore play an important role as a regulator against PST-producing
   phytoplankton. This is the first report about grazing rates of N.
   scintillans on Alexandrium cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that the estuarine dinoflagellates, Pfiesteria
   piscicida Steidinger \& Burkholder and P. shumwayae Glasgow \&
   Burkholder, members of the toxic Pfiesteria complex (TPC), may release
   one or more toxins that kill fish and adversely affect human health, In
   the current study we Investigated the potential for undiagnosed cases ol
   possible estuary-associated syndrome (PEAS), as termed by the Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a population that had
   residential and/or recreational exposure to TPC-affected estuaries, but
   that did not have direct contact with fish kills or lesioned fish.
   Age-adjusted visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) was significantly lower
   and the presence of PEAS-associated symptoms was Much higher in the
   estuary cohort (n = 77) than in combined-control cohorts (n = 87), one
   without exposure to bodies of water (n = 53) and one with exposure to
   marine waters (n = 34). In the estuary cohort, 37 individuals met the
   CDC case definition for PEAS and had significantly lower VCS than
   non-PEAS cases. The VCS improved and symptoms abated after 2 weeks of
   treatment with cholestyramine. Cholestyramine, the original drug
   approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, has previously been
   reported to enhance the elimination rates of a variety of toxins,
   presumably by interruption of enterohepatic recirculation through toxin
   entrapment in its polymeric structure and/or anion-exchange process.
   Control studies showed that repeated VCS testing alone did not improve
   VCS scores and that cholestyramine treatment did not affect VCS in
   patients with elevated cholesterol levels. These results suggested that
   a) susceptible individuals may acquire PEAS through residential and/or
   recreational contact with TPC-affected estuaries in the absence of an
   active fish kill; b) VCS is a useful indicator in PEAS diagnosis and
   treatment monitoring; and c) PEAS can be effectively treated with
   cholestyramine. Because the study did not use population sampling
   techniques, the results do not indicate PEAS prevalence. Furthermore,
   definitive diagnosis of PEAS and association with TPC toxin(s) must
   await identification of, and a serologic test for, the putative TPC
   toxin(s). Key words: cholestyramine, chronic neurotoxic illness, harmful
   algal blooms, Pfiesteria, possible estuary-associated syndrome, visual

Title = {Parrot claylick distribution in South America: do patterns of

Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Geophagy is well known among some Neotropical parrots. The clay
   apparently adsorbs dietary toxins and/or provides supplemental
   nutrients. We used location data and 23 environmental layers to develop
   a predictive model of claylick distribution using Maxent software. We
   related species characteristics to claylick use and examined how parrot
   assemblages using claylicks changed with distance from the centre of
   claylick distribution. Fifty-two parrot claylicks were reported from an
   area of ca 4 million km2 but over 50\% were restricted to a 35 000 km2
   region of southeast Peru and northern Bolivia. Claylicks were strongly
   associated with moist forest on younger (< 65 millions of yr) geological
   formations and exposed river banks. The predictive model of claylick
   distribution matched our reported range well, with precipitation of
   warmest quarter, land cover, temperature seasonality, and distance from
   the ocean being most important predictors of claylick presence.
   Twenty-six of the region's 46 parrot species visited claylicks. Species
   differed greatly in their lick use, but body size, dietary breadth,
   abundance and other traits were poor predictors of lick use. We are
   confident that our survey identified the distribution of major parrot
   claylicks in South America, although less conspicuous parrot geophagy
   may occur elsewhere. We suggest that claylick distribution reflects both
   underlying geology (allowing claylick formation in only some regions)
   and the physiological need for geophagy among parrots in different parts
   of the continent. Data on the latter are inconclusive, but we argue that
   parrot claylick distribution supports the contention that geophagy is
   related more to sodium deficiencies than to protection from dietary
   toxins.},

Abstract = {BackgroundLaji-He is a traditional rice-based snack from the Beibu Gulf
   region in southern China. In the Beibu Gulf region, ``Laji-He{''}
   (literally ``garbage He{''}) signifies the removal of toxins from the
   body, making it a truly ``green{''} food. Laji-He holds essential
   cultural and medicinal value, incorporating various medicinal plants
   into its preparation. Despite its local importance, there is limited
   scientific documentation on the ethnobotanical properties and cultural
   relevance of the plants used. This study aims to analyze the medicinal
   plant used in Laji-He and its implication in human
   medicine.MethodsEthnobotanical surveys and interviews were conducted in
   the Beibu Gulf region, covering local markets and communities. Voucher
   specimens were collected and identified for each plant collected, using
   botanical references, while the relative frequency of citation index was
   used to assess the cultural importance of each plant. Additionally, the
   medicinal properties of these plants were categorized based on
   traditional Chinese medicinal theory and modern pharmacological
   literature. A detailed review of historical texts and local chronicles
   was also performed to trace the historical development and cultural
   changes of Laji-He.ResultsA total of 63 medicinal plants from 36
   families and 53 genera were documented, with Rubiaceae, Fabaceae, and
   Lamiaceae being the most frequently represented families. The most
   commonly used plants, such as Paederia foetida, Piper sarmentosum,
   Houttuynia cordata, Centella asiatica, and Morus alba, were primarily
   utilized for their heat-clearing, detoxifying, and wind-dampness
   expelling properties. Laji-He serves as a symbol of cultural identity
   and community cohesion, particularly during traditional festivals and
   family gatherings, reinforcing collective memory and local
   heritage.ConclusionsLaji-He is a traditional functional snack, with the
   plants used in its preparation serving as both food and medicine.
   Preserving and promoting the culture of Laji-He can contribute to
   enhancing food security and sovereignty at both the local and national
   levels.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial toxins have been shown to have a far-reaching impact-from
   aquatic organisms to human health. Aquatic organisms are typically
   exposed in their natural environment to toxic cyanobacteria, and
   exposure can occur via ingestion of cyanobacterial cells or by
   bioaccumulation of water-borne toxin. The aquaculture and fisheries of
   crustaceans are among the most important seafood industries. Concomitant
   with the growth of this industry, the importance of the health of
   crustaceans increased. The black tiger prawn is the major cultivated
   prawn in Australia. The aquaculture of these prawns takes place in
   shallow ponds, where blooms, often of cyanobacteria, develop.
   Cyanobacterial toxins were hypothesized to contribute to the mortality
   of prawns. Many aquatic organisms have the possibility of detoxifying
   cyanobacterial toxins via conjugation to glutathione. The presence of
   several classes of the cytosolic glutathione S-transferase system in
   black tiger prawns-mu, pi, theta, alpha, and tau-was shown using
   different substrates for measurement. Injection experiments with
   microcystin-LR and feeding experiments with nodularin revealed elevation

Abstract = {MICROCYSTIS aeruginosa is a kind of cyanobacteria microorganism that
   synthesizes and produces peptides, which could be highly toxic. The most
   common toxin known as microcystin (MCs) or cyanotoxins, these toxins are
   heptapeptides produced by cyanobacterial blooms on water surfaces. They
   potentially lead to acute to chronic health-related problems via
   increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and irreversible inhibition of
   serine/threonine protein phosphatases. The toxicological studies of MCs
   on experimental animal and cell models have promise interests; however,
   few information is known about their impacts on humans due to acute or
   chronic exposure. This review article aimed to present some of the
   information about the cyanotoxins structure, occurrence, and
   distribution of the cyanobacterial toxins especially excreted from M.
   aeruginosa. Also, toxicological studies and investigations associated
   with M. aeruginosa producing microcystin, their assessments and control
   and health problems and cancer risk upon MCs exposure will be discussed.
   The article will also discuss the mechanism of the toxin and the way for
   control and degradation.},

   ichthyotoxic cultures (greater than or equal to 2000 cells/ml) has been
   associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like
   symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation

   central nervous system dysfunction {[}sudden rages and personality

   short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including
   asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling
   or numbness in lips, hands, and feet months to years). Elevated hepatic
   enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure
   suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low
   counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression
   (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal,
   and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P
   enrichment (greater than or equal to 100 mu g SRP/L suggesting a
   stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been
   tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay

   characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish
   recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.},

Abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a pervasive environmental toxin, its
   metabolism and detoxification mechanism in freshwater benthic fish under
   dietary exposure remain unknown. In this study, dietborne exposure of
   two iAs (arsenate (AsV) and arsenite (AsIII)) was conducted for yellow
   catfish (Tachysurus fulvidraco) to investigate the bioaccumulation,
   biotransformation, and detoxification of iAs in the fish liver. The
   results showed that As significantly accumulated in both the AsIII and
   AsV treatments compared to the control, and the final As concentration
   was comparable for both treatments. The detoxification of iAs in
   freshwater fish depends on the degree of arsenic methylation and the
   level of antioxidants. Both reduction processes of AsV to AsIII and
   oxidation processes of AsIII to AsV were found in AsV and AsIII
   treatments. The major-low toxicity intermediates, which also are
   detoxification products in the AsIII treatment, were pentavalent
   dimethylarsinic acid and arsenobetaine (AsB), and AsB was major-low
   toxicity intermediate in the AsV treatment. Both antioxidants
   glutathione and glutathione S-transferase contribute to the
   detoxification of iAs by scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species
   and promoting iAs methylation in yellow catfish under iAs exposure.},

Title = {Nature-Based Solution to Eliminate Cyanotoxins in Water Using
   Biologically Enhanced Biochar},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {43},
Pages = {16372-16385},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Climate change and high eutrophication levels of freshwater sources are
   increasing the occurrence and intensity of toxic cyanobacterial blooms
   in drinking water supplies. Conventional water treatment struggles to
   eliminate cyanobacteria/cyanotoxins, and expensive tertiary treatments
   are needed. To address this, we have designed a sustainable,
   nature-based solution using biochar derived from waste coconut shells.
   This biochar provides a low-cost porous support for immobilizing
   microbial communities, forming biologically enhanced biochar (BEB).
   Highly toxic microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was used to influence microbial
   colonization of the biochar by the natural lake-water microbiome. Over
   11 months, BEBs were exposed to microcystins, cyanobacterial extracts,
   and live cyanobacterial cells, always resulting in rapid elimination of
   toxins and even a 1.6-1.9 log reduction in cyanobacterial cell numbers.
   After 48 h of incubation with our BEBs, the MC-LR concentrations dropped
   below the detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL. The accelerated degradation of
   cyanotoxins was attributed to enhanced species diversity and
   microcystin-degrading microbes colonizing the biochar. To ensure
   scalability, we evaluated BEBs produced through batch-scale and
   continuous-scale pyrolysis, while also guaranteeing safety by
   maintaining toxic impurities in biochar within acceptable limits and
   monitoring degradation byproducts. This study serves as a
   proof-of-concept for a sustainable, scalable, and safe nature-based
   solution for combating toxic algal blooms.},

Abstract = {In the disturbed Baltic Sea ecosystem, several animal species display
   failing health related to exposure to toxic compounds, reduced energy
   metabolism and immune system disorders. In order to investigate possible
   associations between fish health and exposure to chemicals affecting the
   energy metabolism and immune defence, the levels of algal toxins
   (bromophenols, hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and
   nodularin), perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) and thiamine (vitamin
   B1) were determined in European flounder (Platichthys flesus). Several
   biomarkers indicating health status were examined in the fish, including
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), and activities of glutathione
   reductase, glutathione S-transferase and catalase, in addition to a
   large set of blood variables. The fish were collected from Hanobukten in
   the south-western parts of the Baltic Sea in late August 2018.
   Regression analyses of algal toxins, PFAS and thiamine concentration
   displayed several significant associations with biomarkers associated
   with detoxification and liver function, immune system function and blood
   status of the fish. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Lecithin-dependent thermolabile hemolysin (LDH) is a virulence factor
   excreted by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a marine bacterium that causes
   important losses in shrimp farming. In this study, the function of LDH
   was investigated through its inhibition by metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+,
   Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+) and chemical modification reagents:
   beta-mercaptoethanol (beta ME), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and
   diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). LDH was expressed in the Escherichia coli
   strain BL-21, purified under denaturing conditions, and the enzymatic
   activity was evaluated. Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Ca2+ at 1 mmol/L inhibited
   the LDH esterase activity by 20-95\%, while Mg2+ and Mn2+ slightly
   increased its activity. Additionally, PMSF and DEPC at 1 mmol/L
   inhibited the enzymatic activity by 40\% and 80\%, respectively.
   Dose-response analysis showed that DEPC was the best-evaluated inhibitor
   (IC50 = 0.082 mmol/L), followed by Cu2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ and PMSF (IC50 =
   0.146-1.5 mmol/L). Multiple sequence alignment of LDH of V.
   parahaemolyticus against other Vibrio species showed that LDH has
   well-conserved GDSL and SGNH motifs, characteristic of the
   hydrolase/esterase superfamily. Additionally, the homology model showed
   that the conserved catalytic triad His-Ser-Asp was in the LDH active
   site. Our results showed that the enzymatic activity of LDH from V.
   parahaemolyticus was modulated by metal ions and chemical modification,
   which could be related to the interaction with catalytic amino acid
   residues such as Ser153 and/or His 393.},

Title = {Exposure to the Paralytic Shellfish Toxin Producer Alexandrium
   catenella Increases the Susceptibility of the Oyster Crassostrea
   gigas to Pathogenic Vibrios},
Journal = {TOXINS},

Abstract = {The multifactorial etiology of massive Crassostrea gigas summer
   mortalities results from complex interactions between oysters,
   opportunistic pathogens and environmental factors. In a field survey
   conducted in 2014 in the Mediterranean Thau Lagoon (France), we
   evidenced that the development of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   catenella, which produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), was
   concomitant with the accumulation of PSTs in oyster flesh and the
   occurrence of C. gigas mortalities. In order to investigate the possible
   role of toxic algae in this complex disease, we experimentally infected
   C. gigas oyster juveniles with Vibrio tasmaniensis strain LGP32, a
   strain associated with oyster summer mortalities, after oysters were
   exposed to Alexandrium catenella. Exposure of oysters to A. catenella
   significantly increased the susceptibility of oysters to V. tasmaniensis
   LGP32. On the contrary, exposure to the non-toxic dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium tamarense or to the haptophyte Tisochrysis lutea used as a
   foraging alga did not increase susceptibility to V. tasmaniensis LGP32.
   This study shows for the first time that A. catenella increases the
   susceptibility of Crassostrea gigas to pathogenic vibrios. Therefore, in
   addition to complex environmental factors explaining the mass
   mortalities of bivalve mollusks, feeding on neurotoxic dinoflagellates
   should now be considered as an environmental factor that potentially
   increases the severity of oyster mortality events.},

Abstract = {Biosynthesis of the unique defensive compound pederin is confined to
   female rove beetles of the genus Paederus (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae).
   These (+)-females endow their eggs with toxin whereas (-)-females, which
   occur both naturally and in laboratory reared specimens, do not. The
   latter are aposymbionts lacking biosynthetic capabilities because of
   endosymbiotic deficiency. They can, however, be induced to accumulate
   pederin if fed with (+)-eggs during larval development. The
   endosymbionts can thus be transmitted by ingestion of (+)-Eggs. (+)-eggs
   treated with benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline or
   streptomycin show that the induction of pederin accumulation depends on
   the antibiotic's spectrum of efficaciousness, its dosage and duration of
   the treatment. Certain bacteria, probably belonging to the gram-negative
   type, must be transmitted to produce (+)-females. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Title = {Cinnamaldehyde regulates the synthesis of Alternaria alternata
   non-host selective toxins by influencing PKS gene expression and
   oxidoreductase activity},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Alternaria alternata causes Black Rot disease in fruits and vegetables,
   and could produce numerous harmful metabolites during pathogen invasion.
   This study demonstrated that a sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.0125 mu
   l/mL cinnamaldehyde could not inhibit the mycelial growth of A. altemata
   in Potato dextrose broth (PDB), but the production of non-host selective
   toxins (NHSTs) was obviously reduced after incubation. The transcriptome
   data showed that down-regulated genes dominated the differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) after cinnamaldehyde treatment, and most DEGs
   were distributed in metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary
   metabolites. Four polyketide synthases genes (PksI, PksJ, PksF and PksA)
   related to mycotoxin biosynthesis in secondary metabolites were screened
   out after transcriptome sequencing and the expression quantity was
   significantly down-regulated by cinnamaldehyde incubation. Moreover, the
   qRT-PCR results showed that cinnamaldehyde inhibited the expression of 4
   Pks genes during the growth of A. altemata. In addition, cinnamaldehyde
   decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content but increased the enzymes
   activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the lower
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the cinnamaldehyde-treated group
   demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde could improve the antioxidase
   activities and eliminate excessive ROS production. The results showed
   that cinnamaldehyde might, through ROS signal transduction, mediate the
   mycotoxin synthesis of alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether
   (AME) and tenuazonic acid (TEA) in A. alternata.},

Abstract = {In order to understand the strategies of physiological adaptation,
   Pacific oysters were exposed to different concentrations of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In 50 mu g l(-1), oysters, at first,
   maintain their metabolism similar to the rate of control. And then, if
   exposure is prolonged, oysters tend to decrease their energy intake
   while increasing catabolic cost due to satisfying the energy demand. In
   200 mu g l(-1), the oyster suppresses metabolic energy intake and
   facilitates excretive metabolism to eliminate intrusive toxins from the
   body from the beginning of the exposure. Due to the suppressed feeding
   activities, oysters accelerate lipid or/and carbohydrate catabolism to
   satisfy the energy demand. A significant decrease of SFG was attributed
   to decreased energy intake (decreased CR and Abs. eff.) and increased
   energy expenditure (increased E and R). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Yessotoxins in Norwegian blue mussels (Mytilus edulis):: uptake

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The Protoceratium reticulatum cell density at Flodevigen reached a
   maximum of 2200 cells/L on 16 May 2001. The levels of yessotoxins (YTXs)
   in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at the same site increased sharply by
   14 May and peaked on 28 May, after which they steadily declined. No
   other algal species present showed a similar pattern of correspondence.
   Together with the recent finding that Norwegian strains of P.
   reticulatum produce YTXs, these results indicate that P. reticulatum
   causes yessotoxin (YTX) contamination of shellfish in Norway, and that
   only relatively low cell densities are necessary for this to occur. The
   mussels from Flodevigen were analyzed by LC-MS for YTX, 45-hydroxyYTX,
   carboxyYTX, and a new yessotoxin believed to be 45-hydroxycarboxyYTX,
   and by ELISA for YTXs. The seasonal variations in toxin content versus
   time measured by the two methods were qualitatively very similar,
   although the response in the ELISA was 3-9 times higher due to the
   antibodies detecting other YTXs that were not detected by the LC-MS
   method. Changes in the LGMS profile for YTXs, and in the ratio of YTXs
   by LC-MS to YTXs by ELISA with time, were consistent with extensive
   metabolism of YTX in the mussels. Kinetic analysis of the LC-MS data
   showed an initial half-life of 20 days for YTX, and for YTX +
   45-hydroxyYTX, in the mussels. Similar analysis of the ELISA data gave a
   half-life of 24 days for YTXs. The depuration rate remained consistent
   over a 3-month period during which the temperature remained at 13-16
   degreesC. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {41-50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Palytoxin (PLTX) is a lethal natural toxin often found in Palythoa
   zoantharians that, together with its congeners, may induce adverse
   effects in humans after inhalation of toxic aerosols both in open-air
   and domestic environments, namely in the vicinity of public and private
   aquaria. In this study, we describe a poisoning of an aquarium hobbyist
   who was hospitalized after handling a PLTXs-containing zoantharian
   hexacoral. Furthermore, we provide evidence for water detoxification.
   The zoantharian was morphologically and genetically identified as
   Palythoa cf. toxica (Cnidaria: Anthozoa). Palytoxin itself and two new
   PLTX congeners, a hydroxyPLTX and a deoxyPLTX, were detected and
   structurally identified by liquid chromatography high resolution
   multiple stage mass spectrometry (LC-HRMSn, n = 1, 2). Total and
   individual toxins were quantified by LC-HRMS and sandwich ELISA both in
   the zoantharian (93.4 and 96.80 mu g/g, respectively) and in the
   transport water (48.3 and 42.56 mu g/mL, respectively), with an
   excellent mean bias of 1.3\% between the techniques. Activated carbon
   adsorbed 99.7\% of PLTXs contained in the seawater and this represents a
   good strategy for preventing aquarium hobbyist poisonings. (C) 2016

Abstract = {N-heterocyclic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N-PAHs) belong among
   newly identified classes of environmental pollutants with relatively
   high toxic potential. N-PAHs have been detected in air, soil, marine
   environments, and freshwater sediments. The N-PAHs are present at lower
   concentrations than their nonsubstituted analogues but their greater
   solubility would lead to greater bioavailibity and potential for toxic
   effects. Here we present results of acute and chronic toxicity in
   traditional aquatic invertebrate ecotoxicological model (Daphnia magna)
   along with assessment of biochemical responses. Studied biomarkers in D.
   magna exposed to N-heterocyclic derivatives included glutathione levels
   and activities of detoxication and antioxidative enzymes glutathione
   S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. Phenanthrene and
   1,10-phenathroline were the most toxic of all tested compounds (EC50 < 6
   mu M after 48 h exposure) and all tested N-PAHs suppressed reproduction
   of Daphnia magna. The data suggest that N-PAHs can induce oxidative
   stress in D. magna. The significant decline of glutathione content was
   found in animals treated with acridine, 1,10-phenanthroline,
   benzo(h)quinoline, phenantridine, and phenazine. Significant decrease of
   GPx activities relative to controls was found for all tested compounds
   except of phenanthrene and phenazine. Activities of GST increased after
   exposure to phenanthridine, phenazine, and benzo(h)quinoline, and
   declined in D. magna treated with phenanthrene (significant at one
   concentration) or anthracene (not significant). Our results confirmed
   significant acute as well as chronic toxicities of N-PAHs as well as
   potential of biochemical parameters to be used as early warning signals
   of toxicity in Daphnia magna. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Interaction of environmental contaminants with zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 7 (Mate7/Slc47a7)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {205},
Pages = {193-203},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Zebrafish Mate7 belongs to solute carrier protein superfamily and
   specifically to subfamily of multidrug and toxin extruders. It is
   co-orthologous to mammalian Mates, and is ubiquitously expressed in
   zebrafish tissues with the highest expression in kidney. It has been
   shown to interact with both endogenous (steroid hormones) and xenobiotic
   compounds (pharmaceuticals), implying a role in efflux of toxic
   compounds. The objective of our study was to analyse interaction of
   environmental contaminants with zebrafish Mate7 using a newly developed
   high throughput screening (HTS) Mate7 assay. A full-length zebrafish
   mate7 sequence was obtained from zebrafish cDNA originating from male
   kidney, and a stable expression of Mate7 in genetically engineered
   HEK293 Flp-In cells was achieved. Stable Mate7 transfectants were then
   used for development and optimization of a new HTS cellular uptake
   protocol, with DAPI and ASP + as model fluorescent substrates. The
   developed assay was used for identifying zebrafish Mate 7 interactors
   and discerning the type of interaction. A series of 89 diverse
   environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides,
   and pharmaceuticals, was tested and highly effective Mate7 interactors
   were identified in all of the aforementioned groups. Some of the
   inhibitors identified could be of environmental concern because they may
   potentially impair Mate7 efflux function, lowering the fish defence
   capacity against environmental contaminants, or interfering with
   transport of yet unidentified physiological substrates. In addition, we
   found significant differences between zebrafish Mate7 and mammalian
   Mates' substrate preferences, a finding that should be taken into
   consideration when using zebrafish as a model organism in toxicokinetic
   studies.},

Title = {Functional Characterization of the Tau Class
   Glutathione-S-Transferases Gene (SbGSTU) Promoter of
   Salicornia brachiata under Salinity and Osmotic Stress},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Reactive oxygen or nitrogen species are generated in the plant cell
   during the extreme stress condition, which produces toxic compounds
   after reacting with the organic molecules. The glutathione-S-transferase
   (GST) enzymes play a significant role to detoxify these toxins and help
   in excretion or sequestration of them. In the present study, we have
   cloned 1023 bp long promoter region of tau class GST from an extreme
   halophyte Salicornia brachiata and functionally characterized using the
   transgenic approach in tobacco. Computational analysis revealed the
   presence of abiotic stress responsive cis-elements like ABRE, MYB, MYC,
   GATA, GT1 etc., phytohormones, pathogen and wound responsive motifs.
   Three 5'-deletion constructs of 730 (GP2), 509 (GP3) and 348 bp (GP4)
   were made from 1023 (GP1) promoter fragment and used for tobacco
   transformation. The single event transgenic plants showed notable GUS
   reporter protein expression in the leaf tissues of control as well as
   treated plants. The expression level of the GUS gradually decreases from
   GP1 to GP4 in leaf tissues, whereas the highest level of expression was
   detected with the GP2 construct in root and stem under control
   condition. The GUS expression was found higher in leaves and stems of
   salinity or osmotic stress treated transgenic plants than that of the
   control plants, but, lower in roots. An efficient expression level of
   GUS in transgenic plants suggests that this promoter can be used for
   both constitutive as well as stress inducible expression of gene(s). And
   this property, make it as a potential candidate to be used as an
   alternative promoter for crop genetic engineering.},

Abstract = {Neurotoxins pose significant challenges in defense and healthcare due to
   their disruptive effects on nervous tissues. Their extreme potency and
   enormous structural diversity have hindered the development of effective
   antidotes. Motivated by the properties of cell membrane-derived
   nanodiscs, such as their ultrasmall size, disc shape, and inherent cell
   membrane functions, here, we develop neuronal membrane-derived nanodiscs
   (denoted ``Neuron-NDs{''}) as a countermeasure nanomedicine for
   broad-spectrum neurotoxin detoxification. We fabricate Neuron-NDs using
   the plasma membrane of human SH-SY5Y neurons and demonstrate their
   effectiveness in detoxifying tetrodotoxin (TTX) and botulinum toxin
   (BoNT), two model toxins with distinct mechanisms of action. Cell-based
   assays confirm the ability of Neuron-NDs to inhibit TTX-induced ion
   channel blockage and BoNT-mediated inhibition of synaptic vesicle
   recycling. In mouse models of TTX and BoNT intoxication, treatment with
   Neuron-NDs effectively improves survival rates in both therapeutic and
   preventative settings. Importantly, high-dose administration of
   Neuron-NDs shows no observable acute toxicity in mice, indicating its
   safety profile. Overall, our study highlights the facile fabrication of
   Neuron-NDs and their broad-spectrum detoxification capabilities,
   offering promising solutions for neurotoxin-related challenges in
   biodefense and therapeutic applications.},

Title = {Isopropylthiol emission by bloom-forming Microcystis: Biochemistry,
   ecophysiology and semiochemistry of a volatile organosulfur compound},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microcystis species not only produce toxic cyanobacterial blooms, but
   can be a significant source of taste and odour. Previous studies have
   associated foul-smelling volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) with
   Microcystis blooms, but have largely attributed these compounds to
   bacterial bloom decomposition. However, earlier reports of the
   production of isopropylthio compounds by several Microcystis strains
   suggests that these cyanobacteria may themselves be a source of these
   VOSCs. Sulphur compounds have been shown to play important semiochemical
   roles in algal cell protection and grazer interactions in marine
   systems, but little is known about the production and chemical ecology
   of freshwater cyanobacterial VOSCs. To address this knowledge gap, we
   undertook the first detailed investigation of the biochemistry,
   ecophysiology and semiochemistry of these compounds and their production
   by Microcystis, and tested the hypothesis that they act as
   multifunctional semiochemicals in processes related to cell protection
   and grazer defence. Using short-term incubations and an adapted
   headspace-GC-MS technique, we investigated VOSC production by axenic and
   non-axenic strains, and verified that isopropylthio compounds are in
   fact produced by these cyanobacteria, identifying 5 isopropyl
   moiety-containing VOSCs (isopropylthiol (ISH), isopropylmethyl sulfide,
   isopropyl methyl disulfide, diisopropyl disulfide (ISSI) and diisopropyl
   trisulfide) as well as methanethiol in three strains. Further studies
   with the axenic strain Microcystis PCC 7806 using different light
   regimes, metabolic inhibitors (sodium azide, DCMU), the antioxidant
   enzyme catalase and stable labelled precursors (hydrogencarbonate,
   acetates and sulfate) demonstrated that ISH is a true exo-metabolite,
   synthesized via the acetate pathway. It is actively produced and
   continuously excreted by the cyanobacteria during growth, with minimal
   internal storage or post-lysis catalytic generation. The molar ratios of
   the redox pair ISH/ISSI are not directly involved in the photosynthetic
   and respiratory electron transport chains, but dependant on the redox
   state of the cell - likely mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as
   shown by a marked effect of catalase. These results, along with
   toxicological and behavioural assays using the two aquatic invertebrates
   Thamnocephalus platyurus and Daphnia magna indicate that ISH plays
   multiple important physiological and ecological roles. It acts as an
   effective antioxidant against high ROS levels, as often experienced in
   surface blooms, it elicits avoidance-related behavioural responses in
   grazer communities and at high levels, it can be toxic to some
   invertebrates.},

   AY-11 dye and pH 9. The decolorization of AY-11 by O-3/UV was slightly
   less efficient than the individual use of O-3 in terms of chemical
   oxygen demand and color removal. Kinetics analysis indicated that AY-11
   dye decolorization followed the pseudo-second order. The final
   degradation products of AY-11 dye in wastewater were identified using
   GC-MS. The AY-11 dye degradation intermediates were identified using
   LC-ESI-MS/MS. The toxicity test on the zooplankton of the treated
   aqueous solution indicated that the O-3 and O-3/UV treatments reduced
   the toxicity effect.},

Abstract = {Periodate oxidation of the toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) yields fluorescent products that are useful for trace
   analysis by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Some toxins are
   oxidized to the same product, while others are transformed to a mixture
   of products; in all cases, the products are too unstable to be isolated
   preparatively. A mobile phase containing heptafluorobutyric acid as an
   ion-pair agent was developed to improve compatibility with liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Several LC/MS
   techniques were investigated: chemical ionization with the moving belt
   interface, atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization, thermospray,
   continuous-flow fast-atom bombardment, and ion-spray. Only LC/ion-spray
   MS was able to provide spectra of the oxidized products. The products
   were characterized as purines resulting from: (a) breakage of the C4-C12
   bond and aromatization of the remaining rings (loss of 4 hydrogens); (b)
   partial elimination of a carbamoyl or N-sulfocarbamoyl side-chain (this
   is promoted by the presence of an N-1-hydroxy group); and (c) partial
   hydrolysis of an N-sulfocarbamoyl side-chain to a carbamoyl group.},

Abstract = {This study isolated lactic acid bacteria from commercially available
   probiotic foods to determine their capacity to remove aflatoxin B-1
   (AFB(1)) and trichothecene-2 (T-2). The removal rates by original live
   and heat-treated cells of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were compared to
   test the effect of heat treatment on efficacy. LAB is capable to remove
   up to 46\% of AFB(1) and up to 45\% of T-2 toixn. The toxin removal
   capability increased as toxin concentration increased despite bacterial
   cell viability declining. Surprisingly, the denatured LAB removed
   greater percentages of AFB(1) (up to 62\%) and T-2 (up to 52\%) than
   live bacterial cells (P < 0.05), lending support to the hypothesis that
   there is higher binding of toxins to the cell membrane of nonviable
   cells. The research provided practical evidences, which suggest that
   when ingested into the gut biota, LAB could likely reduce absorption of
   AFB(1) and T-2 from contaminated foods.},

Abstract = {The paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   ostenfeldii forms dense, recurrent blooms during summer in shallow
   coastal areas of the Baltic Sea. We studied the intra-population
   variability of its allelochemical potency and the responses of
   co-occurring and potentially competing dinoflagellates to the
   allelochemicals. The lytic activity of 10 northern Baltic A. ostenfeldii
   strains was evaluated by their EC50 values (i.e. the cell concentration
   yielding a 50\% decline in cryptophyte density), which were found to
   vary between 236 and 1726 cells ml(-1). When co-occurring
   dinoflagellates (Kryptoperidinium foliaceum, Levanderina fissa and
   Heterocapsa triquetra) were exposed to filtrate of A. ostenfeldii,
   short-term (<1 h) responses of the target species after an initial
   immobilization were species-specific. Almost all of the K. foliaceum
   cells formed cysts, L. fissa cells lost their cell shape and lysed,
   whereas H. triquetra cells shed their thecae. After 24 h, K. foliaceum
   had returned into vegetative cells and the number of immotile L. fissa
   and H. triquetra cells had significantly decreased. The results indicate
   that A. ostenfeldii can disturb the growth of competing dinoflagellates
   by excreting allelochemicals at bloom concentrations and that
   co-occurring species may develop efficient means to escape and recover
   from the allelochemicals, allowing them to coexist with A. ostenfeldii.

Title = {Interactions between the toxic estuarine dinoflagellate Pfiesteria
   piscicida and two species of bivalve molluscs},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {245},
Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {Toxic strains of Phesteria spp. produce toxin(s) that can cause finfish
   death, but much less is known about impacts of Phesteria on shellfish.
   Here we conducted 4 experiments to examine interactions between
   shellfish and toxic (actively toxic or TOX-A from finfish-killing
   cultures and potentially toxic or TOX-B from cultures without finfish)
   and non-inducible (NON-IND, apparently incapable of killing fish via a
   toxic effect) strains of P. piscicida. First (Expt 1), we documented
   direct physical attack by P. piscicida TOX-A, TOX-B, and NON-IND
   zoospores on larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians (Lamarck,
   1819) and the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791).
   Within 5 min zoospores swarmed around larvae that had discarded their
   vela, and attached with their peduncles. Within 15 min they had
   penetrated into the shellfish visceral cavity and had begun to feed
   aggressively; after 30 min all shellfish tissues except the adductor
   muscle had been consumed. Second, we tested the response of scallop
   larvae to P. piscicida (TOX-A or TOX-B) or. cryptomonads (as controls)
   that were held in dialysis tubing (0.22 mum porosity) to prevent direct
   contact. After 60 min larval survival was 0\% in the TOX-A treatment,
   100\% in the cryptomonad control, and intermediate in TOX-B and TOX-B+
   cryptomonad treatments. The data indicate a toxic effect of P. piscicida
   zoospores on the larvae, separate from the physical effect shown in Expt
   1. Third, we compared grazing by juvenile and adult oysters on TOX-A,
   TOX-B, and NON-IND P. piscicida zoospores from the medium. After 60 min,
   grazing by juvenile oysters significantly differed as NON-IND TOX-B
   TOX-A. In contrast, adult oysters grazed significantly fewer TOX-A
   zoospores and maintained comparable grazing on TOX-B and NON-IND
   zoospores. Thus juvenile oysters, but not adults, were sensitive to
   residual toxicity of TOX-B zoospores, and both life-history stages were
   sensitive to TOX-A zoospores. The adverse effects of toxic strains on
   larval survival and juvenile grazing indicate that P. piscicida could
   potentially affect shellfish recruitment. Fourth, we assessed zoospore
   survival after passage through the digestive tract of adult oysters. The
   feces contained many temporary cysts from zoospores, and within 24 h >
   75 \% of the cysts produced motile cells. The data indicate that adult
   oysters would be poor biocontrol agents of P. piscicida, given the high
   survival of ingested zoospores following gut passage and fecal
   elimination; and that oysters could act as vectors of toxic P. piscicida
   strains if transported from affected estuaries to other waters.},

   a mussel processing industry: Impact on control},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {319-323},

Abstract = {Real-Time PCR is a very powerful tool with multiple applications in food
   microbiology, being pathogen detection the most important for food
   safety. In early January 2013 an increase in the incidence of Listeria
   monocytogenes was observed in a mussel-processing facility in the
   north-west of Spain. Then, a previously in-house validated qPCR method
   was applied to detect the contamination origin in the processing line.
   By the end of the same month a total of 62 samples from different spots
   in the processing plant were analyzed, obtaining 25 positive results by
   qPCR. All the isolates, identified as L. monocytogenes, presented the
   same biochemical profile and belonged to the same molecular typing group
   (Group 3). After the identification and elimination of the contamination
   source, 25 additional samples were analyzed over the following nine
   months, without any positive sample. Results obtained showed that the
   qPCR method is a suitable technique to identify the exact source of
   contamination that could appear in food processing plants, saving time
   respect to traditional culture methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the potentially harmful effects of
   zooplankton preexposed to cyanobacteria on two planktivorous animals: a
   fish larva (pike, Esox lucius) and a mysid shrimp (Neomysis integer).
   The planktivores were fed zooplankton from a natural community that had
   been preexposed to cell-free extract or to purified toxin (nodularin) of
   the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena, and the growth, feeding, and
   pellet production of the planktivores, as well as the toxin content of
   the pellets, were measured. In addition, radiolabeled nodularin
   ((3)H-dihydronodularin) was used in separate experiments to measure the
   vector transfer of nodularin from zooplankton to their predators. During
   11-day exposures, dissolved nodularin was transferred to pike larvae and
   N. integer via zooplankton at very low rates of accumulation. Treatment
   with N. spumigena extract decreased the ingestion and feces production
   rates of pike larvae. With purified nodularin alone, no such effect
   could be observed. No effect on molting cycle length, fecal pellet
   production, C:N ratio, or growth of N. integer was detected. The results
   suggest that dissolved cyanobacterial toxins released during bloom decay
   can have a negative impact on feeding and, hence, on the growth of fish
   larvae via zooplankton, even without direct contact between
   cyanobacteria and the fish. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {The value of toxin profiles in the chemotaxonomic analysis of paralytic
   shellfish toxins in determining the relationship between British
   Alexandrium spp. and experimentally contaminated Mytilus sp.},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Although phytoplankton is ubiquitous in the world's oceans some species
   can produce compounds that cause damaging effects in other organisms.
   These include the toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning,
   which, in UK waters, are produced by dinoflagellates from the
   Alexandrium genus. Within Great Britain (GB) a monitoring programme
   exists to detect this harmful genus as well as the Paralytic Shellfish
   Poisoning (PSP) toxins in the flesh of shellfish from classified
   production areas. The techniques used for toxin analysis allow for
   detailed analysis of the toxin profiles present in contaminated
   shellfish. It is possible to compare the toxin profiles of contaminated
   shellfish with the profiles from toxin producing algae and use this
   information to infer the causative microalgal species responsible for
   the contamination. This study sought to evaluate the potential for this
   process within the GB monitoring framework. Two species of toxic
   Alexandrium, A. catenella from Scotland and A. minutum from Southern
   England, were fed to mussels (Mytilus sp.) under controlled conditions.
   The toxin profile in mussels derived from feeding on each species
   independently, when mixed and when introduced sequentially was analysed
   and compared to the source algal cultures using K means cluster
   analysis. Toxin profiles in contaminated shellfish clustered with those
   of the causative algae and separately from one another during toxin
   accumulation and, where A. catenella was the sole toxin source, during
   depuration. During depuration after feeding with A. minutum and where
   mixed or sequential feeding was undertaken deviant toxin profiles were
   observed. Finally, data generated within this experimental study were
   compared to monitoring data from the GB official control programme.
   These data indicated that the causative algal species in sole source
   contaminations could be inferred from toxin profile analysis. This
   technique will be of benefit within monitoring programmes to enhance the
   value of data with minimal additional expense, where the toxin profiles
   of causative microalgae have been well described.},

Title = {Loss of the Acetate Switch in Vibrio vulnificus Enhances
   Predation Defense against Tetrahymena pyriformis},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic human pathogen and autochthonous
   inhabitant of coastal marine environments, where the bacterium is under
   constant predation by heterotrophic protists or protozoans. As a result
   of this selection pressure, genetic variants with antipredation
   mechanisms are selected for and persist in the environment. Such natural
   variants may also be pathogenic to animal or human hosts, making it
   important to understand these defense mechanisms. To identify
   antipredator strategies, 13 V. vulnificus strains of different genotypes
   isolated from diverse environments were exposed to predation by the
   ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis, and only strain ENV1 was
   resistant to predation. Further investigation of the cell- free
   supernatant showed that ENV1 acidifies the environment by the excretion
   of organic acids, which are toxic to T. pyriformis. As this predation
   resistance was dependent on the availability of iron, transcriptomes of
   V. vulnificus in iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions were compared.
   This analysis revealed that ENV1 ferments pyruvate and the resultant
   acetyl-CoA leads to acetate synthesis under aerobic conditions, a
   hallmark of overflow metabolism. The anaerobic respiration global
   regulator arcA was upregulated when iron was available. An DarcA
   deletion mutant of ENV1 accumulated less acetate and, importantly, was
   sensitive to grazing by T. pyriformis. Based on the transcriptome
   response and quantification of metabolites, we conclude that ENV1 has
   adapted to overflow metabolism and has lost a control switch that shifts
   metabolism from acetate excretion to acetate assimilation, enabling it
   to excrete acetate continuously. We show that overflow metabolism and
   the acetate switch contribute to prey-predator interactions.
   IMPORTANCE Bacteria in the environment, including Vibrio spp., interact
   with protozoan predators. To defend against predation, bacteria evolve
   antipredator mechanisms ranging from changing morphology, biofilm
   formation, and secretion of toxins or virulence factors. Some of these
   adaptations may result in strains that are pathogenic to humans.
   Therefore, it is important to study predator defense strategies of
   environmental bacteria. V. vulnificus thrives in coastal waters and
   infects humans. Very little is known about the defense mechanisms V.
   vulnificus expresses against predation. Here, we show that a V.
   vulnificus strain (ENV1) has rewired the central carbon metabolism,
   enabling the production of excess organic acid that is toxic to the
   protozoan predator T. pyriformis. This is a previously unknown mechanism
   of predation defense that protects against protozoan predators.},

Title = {Interactions between red tide microalgae and herbivorous zooplankton::
   the noxious effects of Gyrodinium corsicum (Dinophyceae) on
   Acartia grani (Copepoda: Calanoida)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {21},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Gyrodinium corsicum is a dinoflagellate responsible for recurrent water
   discolourations during winter in Alfacs Bay (Ebre River delta, NW
   Mediterranean). Since first detected in 1994, episodic mortality of
   mussels and fish was attributed to this organism, although no direct
   evidence was obtained. In order to establish the direct role of the
   dinoflagellate in the mortality of marine fauna, we have studied the
   effects of G.corsicum on a potential predator, the co-occurring
   planktonic copepod Acartia grani. Female A.grani were exposed to
   different concentrations of intact cells, and <5 mu m and <0.2 mu m
   filtrates of the dinoflagellate. At concentrations of greater than or
   equal to 3100 cells ml(-1), G.corsicum reduced feeding and egg
   production rates, and caused paralysis and death of A,grani. Low
   dinoflagellate concentrations (630 cells ml(-1)) or the <5 mu m and <0.2
   mu m filtrates were harmless, at least for the duration of the
   experiment. Our study demonstrated that a possible poisoning effect due
   to the ingestion of the dinoflagellate by the copepod must be
   disregarded, and the toxic effects of soluble substances excreted by the
   dinoflagellate, or accompanying free-living toxic bacteria, were not
   causes of copepad paralysis and death. Scanning electron microscopy of
   female A.grani exposed to G.corsicum indicated a clear tendency of the
   dinoflagellate to adhere to the copepod cuticle at preferential zones
   like the urosome and the antennae. Apparently, direct contact between
   the copepod and the dinoflagellate is a prerequisite for the noxious
   effects. Amongst other ecological consequences, the development of
   G.corsicum blooms represents a drastic reduction of grazing pressure in
   the system through the control of the herbivorous populations. Whether
   mechanical or chemical effects are the primary reasons for the observed
   effects is unknown, and to elucidate this will require further research.},

Title = {PHYTOPLANKTON OF THE NORTH-SEA AND ITS DYNAMICS - A REVIEW},
Journal = {NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {1990},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2-4},
Pages = {295-331},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phytoplankton is the major contributor to algal biomass and primary
   production of the North Sea, although crops of macroalgae can locally be
   up to 2000 g C.m-2 along the coast of the U.K. and Norway, and
   microphytobenthos dominates production in the shallow tidal flat areas
   bordering the coasts of England, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. 
   Data collected since 1932 during the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey
   show consistent patterns of geographical, seasonal and annual variation
   in the distribution of phytoplankton and its major taxonomic components.
   There is a trend of increased colouration in Recorder silks in the
   southern North Sea until approximately 1975 since when Colour levels
   (assumed to be indicative of algal biomass) have declined.  In the
   eutrophic Dutch Wadden Sea the algal crop continued to increase; in
   Dutch coastal North Sea waters a trend of biomass increase reversed
   since 1984, apparently due to a reduction in Rhine river outflow. 
   Long-term observations made at Helgoland since the 60's also show trends
   of increasing nutrients and phytoplankton biomass only to 1984.
   Adverse effects such as deoxygenation, foam formation and toxin
   production have been linked to mass concentrations of algae known as
   blooms.  There is no evidence from existing reports for an increase in
   their frequency, although some years stand out with larger numbers. 
   Occurrence of blooms can partly be explained by hydrographic conditions.
   More than 30 taxa are recognised as occurring in bloom proportions in
   the North Sea, approximately one third of which can be toxic.
   The crop of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) is not likely to increase with
   eutrophication due to silicate limitation.  An extensive subsurface
   maximum of armoured dinoflagellates, its abundance governed by
   hydrographic conditions, is the most characteristic feature of the
   central and northern North Sea in the summer months.  Abundance,
   sometimes dominance, of picoplankton and of species that are not readily
   detected by microscopic observations has been documented by measurements
   of taxon-specific pigments such as chlorophyll b (green algae),
   alloxanthin (Cryptophyceae) and 19' - hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin
   (Prymnesiophyceae or Haptophyceae).
   Analysis of time series of satellite images is a promising way to assess
   in a quantitative and, more important, synoptic way the patchy
   distribution of phytoplankton over large regions.  Growth processes of
   the phytoplankton respond according to variables amenable to such
   satellite remote sensing.  Empirical and theoretical relationships that
   can be established between chlorophyll a, C-14 uptake, turbidity,
   stratification, suspended sediment type, irradiance and temperature in
   some well-investigated areas make remote sensing a potential tool to
   obtain reliable estimates of primary production in the whole North Sea. 
   The C-14 method for estimates of the rate of algal growth processes
   appears to agree reasonably well with other methods, both involving
   incubation of samples and in situ measurements of temporal changes of
   oxygen and pH.  The level of net primary production is 250 g C.m-2.a-1
   in the central North Sea, 150 to 200 g C.m-2.a-1 in the northern North
   Sea, and 200 g in the South.  The main metabolic processes involved in
   phytoplankton growth have been modelled mathematically in terms of the
   most important controlling environmental parameters.  Such parameters
   comprise not only those of a chemical signature (micro- and
   macronutrients, both inorganic and organic) but also physical effects of
   vertical mixing and sinking, and biological effects including
   allelopathic interactions, antibiotic excretions, vertical migration,
   and mortality due to grazing and parasitism.  The balance between
   primary production and consumption of organic matter appears to vary
   both geographically and seasonally.  The process of regeneration of
   primary products both in the water column and in and near the bottom
   seems to be of major importance.
   Future research should center around a study of growth-controlling
   parameters in laboratory culture experiments.  The studies should
   include uptake of dissolved organic compounds by all taxonomic groups,
   including pico- and nanophytoplankton, and all aspects of ecosystem
   structure and function involving the relation between algae and
   microheterotrophs making up the small food web.  There is a need to
   synthesize existing information on phytoplankton in the North Sea and
   the factors governing its growth, such as nutrients, river input and
   stratification intensity.  Complicated inter-relationships and
   successional patterns between individual species which are limited by
   varying physiological requirements and adaptation to differing
   hydrographic regimes reemphasizes the importance of species
   identification in phytoplankton studies.  Many future problems in
   phytoplankton research will not be resolved without accurate
   identification of algal species.  Taxonomic expertise takes many years
   to acquire; there is at present a shortage of skills in this area and
   more resources should be turned towards training and long-term support.},

Abstract = {Odontocetes obtain nutrients including essential elements through their
   diet and are exposed to heavy metal contaminants via ingestion of
   contaminated prey. We evaluated the prevalence, concentration, and
   tissue distribution of essential and non-essential trace elements,
   including heavy metal toxicants, in tissue (blubber, kidney, liver,
   skeletal muscle, skin) and fecal samples collected from 90 odontocetes,
   representing nine species, that stranded in Georgia and Florida, USA
   during 2007-2021. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of seven
   essential (cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, zinc)
   and five non-essential (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, thallium)
   elemental analytes using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
   Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and short-finned pilot whales
   (Globicephala macrorhynchus) had the highest median concentrations of
   mercury, cadmium, and lead, while dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) had
   the lowest. Adult pygmy and dwarf sperm whales that stranded in
   2019-2021 had higher concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, lead,
   manganese, selenium, thallium, and zinc compared to those that stranded
   in 2010-2018, suggesting an increasing risk of exposure over time. The
   highest concentrations of many elements (e.g., cadmium, cobalt, copper,
   manganese, molybdenum, thallium, zinc) were in fecal samples,
   illustrating the usefulness of this noninvasively collected sample.
   Aside from fecal samples, hepatic tissues had the highest concentrations
   of iron, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, and selenium in most species;
   renal tissues had the highest concentrations of cadmium; skin had the
   highest concentrations of zinc; and copper, arsenic, and lead

Title = {Extracellular Metabolism Sets the Table for Microbial Cross-Feeding},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The transfer of nutrients between cells, or cross-feeding, is a
   ubiquitous feature of microbial communities with emergent properties
   that influence our health and orchestrate global biogeochemical cycles.
   Cross-feeding inevitably involves the externalization of molecules. Some
   of these molecules directly serve as cross-fed nutrients, while others
   can facilitate cross-feeding. Altogether, externalized molecules that
   promote cross-feeding are diverse in structure, ranging from small
   molecules to macromolecules. The functions of these molecules are
   equally diverse, encompassing waste products, enzymes, toxins, signaling
   molecules, biofilm components, and nutrients of high value to most
   microbes, including the producer cell. As diverse as the externalized
   and transferred molecules are the cross-feeding relationships that can
   be derived from them. Many cross-feeding relationships can be summarized
   as cooperative but are also subject to exploitation. Even those
   relationships that appear to be cooperative exhibit some level of
   competition between partners. In this review, we summarize the major
   types of actively secreted, passively excreted, and directly transferred
   molecules that either form the basis of cross-feeding relationships or
   facilitate them. Drawing on examples from both natural and synthetic
   communities, we explore how the interplay between microbial physiology,
   environmental parameters, and the diverse functional attributes of
   extracellular molecules can influence cross-feeding dynamics. Though
   microbial cross feeding interactions represent a burgeoning field of
   interest, we may have only begun to scratch the surface.},

   Monitoring},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3354-3387},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microcystins are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that
   act as hepatotoxins in higher organisms. These toxins can be altered
   through abiotic processes, such as photodegradation and adsorption, as
   well as through biological processes via metabolism and bacterial
   degradation. Some species of bacteria can degrade microcystins, and many
   other organisms metabolize microcystins into a series of conjugated
   products. There are toxicokinetic models used to examine microcystin
   uptake and elimination, which can be difficult to compare due to
   differences in compartmentalization and speciation. Metabolites of
   microcystins are formed as a detoxification mechanism, and little is
   known about how quickly these metabolites are formed. In summary,
   microcystins can undergo abiotic and biotic processes that alter the
   toxicity and structure of the microcystin molecule. The environmental
   impact and toxicity of these alterations and the metabolism of
   microcystins remains uncertain, making it difficult to establish
   guidelines for human health. Here, we present the current state of
   knowledge regarding the alterations microcystins can undergo in the
   environment.},

   B1},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aflatoxin B-1(AFB(1)) is a known toxic human carcinogen and can be
   detoxified by laccases, which are multicopper oxidases that convert
   several environmental pollutants and toxins. In this study, a new
   laccase that could catalyze AFB(1)degradation was purified and
   identified from the white-rot fungusCerrena unicolor6884. The laccase
   was purified using (NH4)(2)SO(4)precipitation and anion exchange
   chromatography, and then identified as Lac 2 through zymogram and
   UHPLC-MS/MS based on the Illumina transcriptome analysis ofC.
   unicolor6884. Six putative laccase protein sequences were obtained via
   functional annotation. Thelac 2cDNA encoding a full-length protein of
   512 amino acids was cloned and sequenced to expand the fungus laccase
   gene library for AFB(1)detoxification. AFB(1)degradation by Lac 2 was
   conducted in vitro at pH 7.0 and 45 degrees C for 24 h. The half-life of
   AFB(1)degradation catalyzed by Lac 2 was 5.16 h. Acetosyringone (AS),
   Syrinagaldehyde (SA) and {[}2,2 `
   -azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] (ABTS) at 1 mM
   concentration seemed to be similar mediators for strongly enhancing
   AFB(1)degradation by Lac 2. The product of AFB(1)degradation catalyzed
   by Lac 2 was traced and identified to be Aflatoxin Q(1)(AFQ(1)) based on
   mass spectrometry data. These findings are promising for a possible
   application of Lac 2 as a new aflatoxin oxidase in degrading
   AFB(1)present in food and feeds.},

Abstract = {Large-scale artificial upwelling was tested as a method to enhance the
   environmental conditions for the growth of non-toxic algae in a
   Norwegian fjord (61 degrees 0'N, 6 degrees 22'E). The experiment was
   designed to evaluate if nutrient-rich seawater, brought up from below
   the mixed zone of a stratified fjord to the euphotic zone by air
   bubbling, would stimulate the growth of non-toxic relative to toxic
   algae. Pumping 44 m(3) min(-1) of air at 1 atm through a pipe diffuser
   submerged at 40 m depth formed a buoyancy flux that lifted 60 m(3) s(-1)
   of deep water to the upper 17 m over a period of 21 days. The supply of
   silicate, inorganic nitrogen and phosphate to the upper 10 m in the
   fjord increased, and a significant increase in the biomass of non-toxic
   algae was observed. The upwelling gave an increased growth of the
   nontoxic dinoflagellates Ceratium furca and C. tripos. After termination
   of the experiment, the phytoplankton biomass decreased significantly,
   whereas a distinct increase occurred in the relative biomass of the
   potentially toxic Dinophysis spp. The result is considered promising
   when it comes to creating controlled geographical areas with non-toxic
   food for mussel production.},

Title = {Technologies to eliminate microplastic from water: Current approaches
   and future prospects},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {199},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a widespread environmental threat
   which must be addressed as it affects the water bodies, soil as well as
   air. MPs originally from synthetic textiles, tire abrasion, plastic
   waste, etc. pose the significant risks to both the environment and
   health due to its structure, ability to absorb toxins and act as
   carriers of harmful substances. This characteristic enables MPs to
   accumulate toxic substances and spread them within the food chain which
   leads to adverse effects on both the environment and human health
   including possible endocrine disruption. This problem needs to be solved
   in order to protect the self-regulatory systems of the environment and
   safeguard for human health. This review investigates various methods
   developed to eliminate MPs from water which each method exposes its own
   strengths and limitations. Conventional methods, such as filtration,
   coagulation-flocculation, and sedimentation serve as the primary line of
   defense but often struggle with smaller particles. Membrane filtration,
   magnetic separation, and electrochemical methods have shown better
   performance particularly for a wider MPs size range. However, their
   adoption is limited due to high costs and high energy requirement. A
   chemical approach focuses on the use of reactors to degrade MPs as a
   means of overcoming the problem posed by the persistent particles.
   Biological approaches, including bioremediation through bacteria, fungi,
   and algae offer eco-friendly alternatives by breaking down MPs into less
   harmful components. Future directions in MPs management involve the
   integration of these technologies for enhanced removal efficiency, the
   development of novel materials, and improved system designs to reduce
   costs and environmental impact. In summary, advancing research in
   biotechnological solutions and optimizing existing methods is critical
   to address the widespread and complex nature of MPs pollution to ensure
   healthier ecosystems and safer water supplies.},

Abstract = {We report on the emergence of Cochlodinium polykrikigides blooms in the
   Peconic Estuary and Shinnecock Bay, NY, USA, during 2002-2006. Blooms
   occurred during late summer when temperatures and salinities ranged from
   20 to 25 degrees C and 22 to 30 ppt, respectively. Bloom patches
   achieved cell densities exceeding 10(5) ml(-1) and chlorophyll a levels
   exceeding 100 mu g l(-1), while background bloom densities were
   typically 10(3)- 10(4) cells ml(-1). Light, scanning electron and
   ultrathin-section transmission electron microscopy suggested that cells
   isolated from blooms displayed characteristics of C. polykrikoides and
   provide the first clear documentation of the fine structure for this
   species. Sequencing of a hypervariable region of the large subunit rDNA
   confirmed this finding, displaying 100\% similarity to other North
   American C polykrikoides strains, but a lower similarity to strains from
   Southeast Asia (88-90\%). Bioassay experiments demonstrated that 24 h
   exposure to bloom waters (>5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) killed 100\% of
   multiple fish species (1-week-old Cyprinodon variegates, adult Fundulus
   majalis, adult Menidia menidia) and 80\% of adult Fundulus heteroclitus.
   Microscopic evaluation of the gills of moribund fish revealed epithelial
   proliferation with focal areas of fusion of gill lamellae, suggesting
   impairment of gill function (e.g. respiration, nitrogen excretion, ion
   balance). Lower fish mortality was observed at intermediate C.
   polykrikoides densities (10(3)-10(4) cells ml(-1)), while fish survived
   for 48 h at cell densities below 1 x 10(3) cells ml(-1). The inability
   of frozen and thawed-, or filtered (0.2 mu m)-bloom water to cause fish
   mortality suggested that the thick polysaccharide layer associated with
   cell membranes and/or a toxin principle within this layer may be
   responsible for fish mortality. Juvenile bay scallops (A rgopecten
   irradians) and American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) experienced
   elevated mortality compared to control treatments during a 9-day
   exposure to bloom water (similar to 5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)). Surviving
   scallops exposed to bloom water also experienced significantly reduced
   growth rates. Moribund shellfish displayed hyperplasia, hemorrhaging,
   squarnation, and apoptosis in gill and digestive tissues with gill
   inflammation specifically associated with areas containing C.
   polykrikoides cells. In summary, our results indicate C. polykrikoides
   blooms have become annual events on eastern Long Island and that bloom
   waters are capable of causing rapid mortality in multiple species of
   finfish and shellfish. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) proteins are involved in the
   extrusion of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics across the plasma
   membrane. They are conserved from bacteria to mammals, with different
   numbers of genes within groups. Here, we present the first data on
   identification and functional characterization of Mate proteins in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio). Phylogenetic analysis revealed six Mates in
   teleost fish, annotated as Mate3-8, which form a distinct cluster
   separated from the tetrapod MATEs/Mates. Synteny analysis showed that
   zebrafish mate genes are orthologous to human MATEs. Gene expression
   analysis revealed that all the mate transcripts were constitutively and
   differentially expressed during embryonic development, followed by
   pronounced and tissue-specific expression in adults. Functional analyses
   were performed using transport activity assays with model substrates
   after heterologous overexpression of five zebrafish Mates in HEK293T
   cells. The results showed that zebrafish Mates interact with both
   physiological and xenobiotic substances but also substantially differ
   with respect to the interacting compounds and interaction strength in
   comparison to mammalian MATEs/Mates. Taken together, our data clearly
   indicate a potentially important role for zebrafish Mate transporters in
   zebrafish embryos and adults and provide a basis for detailed functional
   characterizations of single zebrafish Mate transporters.},

Title = {Use of valvometry as an alert tool to signal the presence of toxic algae
   Alexandrium catenella by Mytilus edulis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Valvometry is a non-invasive technique used to continuously monitor
   gaping behaviour of bivalves at high frequency. In previous laboratory
   studies, valvometry has revealed a behavioural sensitivity of bivalves
   to the presence of toxic microalgae in seawater. However, the
   application of valvometry as an early-warning system for detecting
   natural occurrences of toxic microalgae and their resulting toxicity in
   bivalves remains largely unexplored. In this study, valvometry was used
   to characterise changes in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) gaping
   behaviour during gradual exposure to the toxic dinoflagellate,
   Alexandrium catenella, which produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PST).
   Laboratory experiments were first performed to identify specific gaping
   behaviour changes and these responses were subsequently validated in
   natural seawater conditions in a second experiment. Under both
   laboratory and natural seawater conditions, mussels exposed to A.
   catenella tended to remain open (yawning) longer than non-exposed
   mussels. This change in gaping behaviour was observed at PST
   concentration as low as 30 mu g STXeq 100 g-1 of mussel tissue. We
   suggest that increased opening is likely related to temporary muscular
   paralysis induced by toxic algae, as this mechanism has been previously
   reported in other bivalve species. Furthermore, we observed that
   biological rhythms of valve behaviour related to tidal and daily rhythms
   were modified when mussels were intoxicated by PSP (Paralytic Shellfish
   Poisoning). In conclusion, the effects of toxic algae on mussel gaping
   behaviour reveals that valvometry could be used as an early-warning tool
   for the presence of toxic Alexandrium sp. in the environment prior to
   mussels reaching the regulatory threshold (80 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)) for
   harvest interdiction.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are widely distributed neurotoxins,
   and the PST metabolic detoxification mechanism in bivalves has received
   increasing attention. To reveal the effect of phase I (cytochrome
   P450)-II (GST)-III (ABC transport) metabolic systems on the PST
   metabolism in Azumapecten farreri, this study amplified stress on the
   target systems using rifampicin, dl-alpha-tocopherol, and colchicine;
   measured PST levels; and conducted transcriptomic analyses. The highest
   toxin content reached 1623.48 mu g STX eq/kg in the hepatopancreas and
   only 8.8\% of that in the gills. Inducer intervention significantly
   decreased hepatopancreatic PST accumulation. The proportional reductions
   in the rifampicin-, dl-alpha-tocopherol-, and colchicine-induced groups
   were 55.3\%, 50.4\%, and 36.1\%, respectively. Transcriptome analysis
   showed that 11 modules were significantly correlated with PST metabolism
   (six positive/five negative), with phase I CYP450 and phase II
   glutathione metabolism significantly enriched in negatively correlated
   pathways. Twenty-three phase I-II-III core genes were further validated
   using qRT-PCR and correlated with PST metabolism, revealing that
   CYP46A1, CYP4F6, GSTM1, and ABCF2 were significantly correlated, while
   CYP4F11 and ABCB1 were indirectly correlated. In conclusion, phase
   I-II-III detoxification enzyme systems jointly participate in the
   metabolic detoxification of PSTs in A. farreri. This study provides key
   data support to profoundly elucidate the PST metabolic detoxification
   mechanism in bivalves.},

Abstract = {One potential physiological target for new antischistosomals is the
   parasite's system for excretion of wastes and xenobiotics.
   P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of the ATP-binding-cassette superfamily
   of proteins, is an ATP-dependent efflux pump involved in transport of
   toxins and xenobiotics from cells. In vertebrates, increased expression
   of Pgp is associated with multidrug resistance in tumor cells. Pgp may
   also play a role in drug resistance in helminths. In this report, we
   examine the relationship between praziquantel (PZQ), the current drug of
   choice against schistosomiasis, and Pgp expression in Schistosoma
   mansoni. We show that levels of RNA for SMDR2, a Pgp homolog from S.
   mansoni, increase transiently in adult male worms following exposure to
   sub-lethal concentrations (100-500 nM) of PZQ. A corresponding, though
   delayed, increase in anti-Pgp immunoreactive protein expression occurs
   in adult males following exposure to PZQ The level of anti-Pgp
   immunoreactivity in particular regions of adult worms also increases in
   response to PZQ Adult worms from an Egyptian S. mansoni isolate with
   reduced sensitivity to PZQ express increased levels of SMDR2 RNA and
   anti-Pgp-immunoreactive protein, perhaps indicating a role for multidrug
   resistance proteins in development or maintenance of PZQ resistance. (C)

Title = {Sea temperature influences accumulation of tetrodotoxin in British
   bivalve shellfish},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {885},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent neurotoxin mostly associated with
   pufferfish poisoning, is also found in bivalve shellfish. Recent studies
   into this emerging food safety threat reported TTX in a few, mainly
   estuarine, shellfish production areas in some European countries,
   including the United Kingdom. A pattern in occurrences has started to
   emerge, however the role of temperature on TTX has not been investigated
   in detail. Therefore, we conducted a large systematic TTX screening
   study, encompassing over 3500 bivalve samples collected throughout 2016
   from 155 shellfish monitoring sites along the coast of Great Britain.
   Overall, we found that only 1.1 \% of tested samples contained TTX above
   the reporting limit of 2 mu g/kg whole shellfish flesh and these samples
   all originated from ten shellfish production sites in southern England.
   Subsequent continuous monitoring of selected areas over a five-year
   period showed a potential seasonal TTX accumulation in bivalves,
   starting in June when water temperatures reached around 15 degrees C.
   For the first time, satellite-derived data were also applied to
   investigate temperature differences between sites with and with-out
   confirmed presence of TTX in 2016. Although average annual temperatures
   were similar in both groups, daily mean values were higher in summer and
   lower in winter at sites where TTX was found. Here, temperature also
   in-creased significantly faster during late spring and early summer, the
   critical period for TTX. Our study supports the hy-pothesis that
   temperature is one of the key triggers of events leading to TTX
   accumulation in European bivalves.},

Abstract = {Suspension-feeding bivalves are considered efficient toxin vectors with
   a relative insensitivity to toxicants compared to other aquatic
   organisms. This fact highlights the potential role of detoxification
   enzymes, such as glutathione transferases (GSTs), in this bivalve
   resistance. Nevertheless, the GST system has not been extensively
   described in these organisms. In the present study, cytosolic GSTs
   isoforms (cGST) were surveyed in three bivalves with different habitats
   and life strategies: Corbicula fluminea, Anodonta cygnea and Mytilus
   galloprovincialis. GSTs were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity
   chromatography, and the collection of expressed cGST classes of each
   bivalve were identified using a proteomic approach. All the purified
   extracts were also characterized kinetically. Results reveal variations
   in cGST subunits collection (diversity and properties) between the three
   tested bivalves. Using proteomics, four pi-class and two sigma-class GST
   subunits were identified in M. galloprovincialis. C. fluminea also
   yielded four pi-class and one sigma-class GST subunits. For A. cygnea,
   two mu-class and one pi-class GST subunits were identified, these being
   the first record of GSTs from these freshwater mussels. The affinity
   purified extracts also show differences regarding enzymatic behavior
   among species. The variations found in cGST collection and kinetics
   might justify diverse selective advantages for each bivalve organism.},

Abstract = {Studies have reported the impact of frying on the nutritional and
   sensory properties of mackerel. However, no study has reviewed this
   topic. This study reviewed the effects of different frying processes on
   the nutritional and sensory characteristics of mackerel, with and
   without batter, marinade, and spice. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PubMed,
   and ScienceDirect were used as online databases to find relevant
   articles. We found that the nutritional, physicochemical, and sensory
   properties of fried mackerel without treatment were influenced by frying
   methods. Deep frying affected the oxidation of lipids and degradation of
   proteins, while air frying increased the overall acceptance score.
   Frying can reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), eliminate some
   toxins, lower the trypsin inhibitor (TI), and increase the sensory
   parameters of mackerel with batter, marinade, and spice treatment. The
   different ingredients of minced mackerel products preserved their
   nutritional and sensory parameters after frying. Interestingly, vacuum
   frying resulted in lower oxidation and maintenance of nutritional and
   sensory parameters of fried mackerel (with or without treatment) and
   minced mackerel products. Further research is needed to reveal the
   effectiveness of vacuum frying in maintaining the nutritional and
   sensory properties of fried and minced mackerel products.},

Title = {Environmental contaminants modulate transport activity of zebrafish

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {901},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Zebrafish Mate3 is one of six co-orthologs of human multidrug and toxin
   extrusion proteins. It is highly expressed in the kidneys, intestine,
   testes, and brain of males. Initial interaction studies showed its
   interaction with xenobiotic compounds, suggesting a role in the efflux
   of toxic compounds. In this study, we aimed to test various
   environmental contaminants for their interaction with zebrafish Mate3.
   We developed a stable zebrafish Mate3 cell line and optimized a
   high-throughput screening assay using DAPI and ASP+ as fluorescent model
   substrates. To gain insight into the structure and function of the Mate3
   protein and relate these to the results of the DAPI and ASP+ transport
   measurements, we predicted its 3D structure using the AlphaFold2
   algorithm. A 3D structure with high per residue confidence scores with
   13 transmembrane segments (TMs) was obtained, with topology and mutual
   positioning characteristic of the Mate protein family in a shape open to
   the extracellular part. Mo-lecular docking methods were used to identify
   DAPI and ASP+ binding sites on the surface and in the center of the
   protein cavity. Because our kinetics experiments combined with molecular
   docking indicated that there may be additional active sites in zebrafish
   Mate3, additional cytotoxicity experiments were performed and highly
   potent Mate3 interactors were identified from a set of 55 different
   environmental contaminants. Our results suggest that some of the
   identified interactors may be of environmental concern, as their
   interaction with Mate3 could lead to an impairment of its normal efflux
   function, making fish more sensitive to harmful substances commonly
   released into the aquatic environment. Finally, the quality of zebrafish
   Mate3 structures predicted by the AlphaFold2 algorithm opens up the
   possibility of successfully using this tool for in silico research on
   transport preferences of other Mate proteins.},

Title = {BIOACCUMULATIVE POTENTIAL AND TOXICITY OF ENDOSULFAN INSECTICIDE TO
   NONTARGET ANIMALS},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY \& PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {105},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-361},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Endosulfan insecticide is a polychlorinated compound used for
   controlling a variety of insects; it is practically water-insoluble, but
   readily adheres to clay particles and persists in soil and water for
   several years. Its mode of action involves repetitive nerve-discharges
   positively correlated to increase in temperature. This compound is
   extremely toxic to most fish and can cause massive mortalities. In fish,
   it causes marked changes in Na and K concentrations, decrease in blood
   Ca2+ and Mg levels and inhibits Na, K and Mg-dependent ATPase (in
   brain),
   2. Bioaccumulation of endosulfan is reported for marine animals;
   however, freshwater animals (e.g. crayfish) accumulate it to some
   extent, but they lose the compound rapidly during depuration. Endosulfan
   is generally less toxic to aquatic invertebrates than fish. However, it
   causes decreases in adenylate energy charge, oxygen consumption,
   hemolymph amino acids, succinate dehydrogenase, heart-beat (mussel) and
   altered osmoregulation.
   3. Generally, mammals are less susceptible to endosulfan's toxicity than
   aquatic animals. The majority of studies conducted on laboratory mammals
   can be summarized. (a) Neurotoxicity: male rats are more sensitive than
   females to endosulfan, which decreases brain and plasma
   acetylcholinesterase activity. Endosulfan I (a metabolite) causes a
   significant change in norepinephrine, 5-HT and GABA. (b) Renal toxicity:
   inhibition of MFOs activity was noticed in rats; other effects included
   changes in proximal convoluted tubules and necrosis of the tubular
   epithelium. (c) Hepatotoxicity: chemically-induced aminopyrine
   N-demethylase and aniline hydrolase were found in rat liver, and
   reduction in the glycogen level occurred. (d) Hematologic toxicity:
   endosulfan exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the
   erythrocyte glutathione reductase, hemoglobin amount, RBC number and
   mean corpuscular volume.
   4. Respiratory toxicity: involved dyspnea, acute emphysema, cyanosis and
   hemorrhages in the interalveolar partitions of rat's lungs.
   5. Biochemical: in rats, endosulfan caused increased glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase activity, blood glucose level, phospholipid contents of
   the microsomal and surfactant system, and profoundly induced the
   activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and cytosolic glutathione
   S-transferases. It also decreased significantly Na+, K+ and Mg2+
   ATPases, plasma calcium level and alkaline phosphatase in the intestinal
   epithelium.
   6. Immunologic toxicity: rat serum antibody titer to tetanus toxin, IgG,
   IgM and gammaglobulins were significantly reduced.
   7. Reproductive toxicity: degenerative changes in the seminiferous
   epithelium, induction of the rate-limiting in testosterone production
   (3beta-hydroxysteroid transferase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid
   transferase), histological changes in reproductive organs, testicular
   atrophy and the occurrence of ovarian cysts were noticed in rat.
   Reduction in the weight of secondary sex organ was also observed.
   8. Developmental, teratogenic and genotoxicity: this insecticide caused
   a significant increase in the fetal resorption of rats. Skeletal
   abnormalities included underweight fetuses, small 4th and 5th unossified
   sternabrae. No fetotoxic or teratogenic activity was found in rabbits;
   however, in chickens, egg-hatchability and sterility occurred due to
   antimitotic activity. Endosulfan caused significant chromosomal
   aberrations in mouse and hamster bone-marrow cells and damage to
   spermatozoa cells. In Drosophila, sex-linked recessive lethals were
   noticed. In mice, dominant lethal mutations occurred; increase in
   abnormal sperm and decrease in count occurred.
   9. Carcinogenic toxicity: not reported to be carcinogenic in B6C3F mice
   or humans by any route of exposure.
   10. Toxicity to humans: endosulfan exposure has exhibited epileptic
   effects, hyperactivity, irritability, tremors, convulsions and paralysis
   in humans. A suicidal attempt by a 20-year old male who ingested 30\%
   endosulfan caused hypoxia, followed by recurrent aspiration pneumonia,
   episodes of tachycardiogenic shock which was preceded by tachycardia and
   hypertension.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are cyanobacterial toxins that can negatively impact
   human and animal health. This study investigated the bioaccumulation,
   transfer, depuration, and health risks of MCs in strawberry plants
   (Fragaria vulgaris) and Meriones shawi animals. The plants were
   irrigated with 1, 5, 10, and 20 mu g/L MCs for 60 days (bioaccumulation
   phase) and then with clean water for 30 days (depuration phase). The
   harvested plants (roots and leaves) were then prepared in an aliquot
   form and used as feed for Meriones shawi. Liquid chromatographymass
   spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used to measure MC concentrations in plant
   and animal tissues. The bioaccumulation of MCs was found to be highest
   in the roots, followed by leaves, fruits, liver, stomach, and fecal
   matter. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was highest in perlite (8.48),
   followed by roots (5.01), leaves (1.55), stomach (0.87), and fecal
   matter (1.18), indicating that the parts with high bioaccumulation
   factor had high translocation of MCs. The transfer of MCs to animal
   organs was low, and the daily toxin intake of adult consumers of
   strawberry fruit irrigated with 1, 5, 10, and 20 mu g/L MC did not
   exceed the WHO-recommended limit of 0.04 mu g MC-LR/Kg of bw/day.
   However, fruits from plants irrigated with 10 and 20 mu g/L may pose a
   moderate health risk to children (25 Kg bw), and Meriones' consumption
   of leaves may pose a significant health risk. After the depuration
   phase, MC concentration in perlite, roots, leaves, and fruits decreased,
   indicating that depuration reduced the danger of MC transmission and
   bioaccumulation. The study also found that glutathione reductase and
   glutathione S-transferase activity were essential in the depuration of
   MCs in the tested plants. The findings suggest that legislation
   regulating the quality of irrigation water in terms of MC concentrations
   is necessary to prevent detrimental consequences to crops and human
   exposure.},

Title = {Recovery of Alexandrium tamarense under chronic exposure of
   TiO2 nanoparticles and possible mechanisms},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {208},
Pages = {98-108},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HAB), heavily influenced by human activities, pose
   serious hazard to aquatic ecology and human health. In this study, we
   monitored the physiological responses and paralytic shellfish poisoning
   toxins (PSTs) of the toxin-producing HAB species Alexandrium tamarense
   under titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO2) exposure in the
   concentration range of 2-320 mg L-1 over a period of 13 days. The
   results showed the acute inhibition of nTiO2 on the algal growth,
   photosynthetic efficiency and esterase activity at all concentrations
   except 2 mg L-1. Nonetheless, they recovered after 13 days nTiO2
   exposure from 20 to 80 mg L-1. The EC50 value increased from 85.1 mg L-1
   in Day 4 to 140.9 mg L-1 in Day 13. The physiological recovery after
   prolonged exposure may result from the elimination of excess reactive
   oxygen species (ROS), a combined outcome of increased nTiO2 aggregation
   and algal antioxidant defense mechanisms. This observation is supported
   by the immediately increased antioxidant enzyme activities, including
   the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities upon nTiO2
   exposure. Moreover, the production of PSTs in A. tamarense significantly
   increased by 1.41-1.76 folds after chronic nTiO2 exposure at all tested
   concentrations (p < 0.05), which might also be an adaptive response for
   the microalgae to overcome the stresses. In particular, the proportions
   of highly-toxic PSTs analogues GTX2/3, STX and dcSTX were significantly
   increased upon nTiO2 exposure (p < 0.05). Hence, the chronic nTiO2
   exposure might aggravate the ecological impact of HABs. Furthermore
   investigations on different HAB species, especially those
   toxin-producing ones, and detail physiological responses are obviously
   needed.},

   retardation in shrimp and alleviating effects of bile acids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {459},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most toxic mycotoxins prevalent in the
   environment and food chain, posing severe health risks to humans and
   animals. Bile acids are natural detergents synthesized from cholesterol
   and play a key role in the excretion of toxins in vertebrates. Here,
   pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) served as an animal model to
   examine the toxicity mechanisms of AFB1 and assess the potential
   alleviating effects of bile acids against AFB1. Our results revealed
   that AFB1 exposure significantly inhibited the growth performance and
   immune response of shrimp, accompanied by AFB1 accumulation and
   histological damage. Mechanistically, AFB1-induced DNA damage activated
   DNA repair mechanisms and induced the arrest of cell cycle via the
   ATRcyclin B/cdc2 pathway. Additionally, AFB1 directly suppressed the
   immune response and growth performance of shrimp by inhibiting Toll and
   IMD pathways and the secretion of digestive enzymes. Notably, dietary
   bile acids significantly reduced AFB1 accumulation and alleviated
   AFB1-induced growth retardation and immunotoxicity in shrimp, and CCKAR,
   ATR, and Relish may be key mediators of the alleviating effects of bile
   acids. Our study provided new insights into the toxicity mechanisms of
   AFB1 in invertebrates and highlighted the potential of bile acids to
   alleviate AFB1 toxicity.},

Abstract = {The incidence of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and patulin in fruits and
   processed fruit products has been ever more challenging and gained
   additional focus on ecofriendly mitigation strategies. The onset of
   these toxins is due to several factors involving insect attacks,
   agricultural practices, and climate change. Acute and chronic health
   hazards are clinically proven after consuming contaminated foodstuffs,
   even at lower concentrations of mycotoxins. Synergistic, masked, and
   substantial occurrence in fruit matrices increase their complexity in
   detection and detoxification; apparently, this article reviewed the
   available information on the occurrence of mycotoxins in several fruits
   and their products, focused on the conventional and advanced methods of
   identification, quantification, and decontamination techniques.
   Strengthening and implementing stringent international and national
   guidelines are required for impactful, tangible measures in the future.
   Nevertheless, controlling the mycotoxins in fruits will certainly be
   challenging for scientists. Therefore, more impactful technologies are
   still needed to eliminate the toxins at the threshold level of the food
   chain and ensure sustainable global food safety.},

Abstract = {The structure of the axillary organ of a batrachoidid species, the gulf
   toadfish (Opsanus beta Goode and Bean 1879), has been examined and
   several simple experiments designed to elucidate its function performed.
   Electron microscopy (EM) studies revealed cells and structures
   suggesting secretory and iono regulatory roles (e.g., abundant
   intracytoplasmic secretory particles, rough endoplasmic reticulum,
   sparse Golgi bodies, indented epithelial cells with microvilli, numerous
   endocytotic vesicles, etc.). Our physiological experiments allowed us to
   reach several conclusions: the organs do not excrete significant
   quantities of urea relative to other areas of the fish (head and gills),
   the organs do not secrets a substance that is toxic to a teleost test
   fish (Gambusia affinis), the secretions do not induce short-term
   modifications in locomotory activity of other gull toadfish (e.g., by
   pheromonal means) and the secretions do not inhibit the growth of
   several species of microorganisms in culture, The function of the organ
   and its secretions remains unknown, representing a fertile area for
   research on structure and function in comparative physiology. COMP

Abstract = {Numerous herbivores orally secrete defense compounds to detoxify plant
   toxins. However, little is known about the role of orally secreted
   enzymes by a specialized pest, Plutella xylostella, in the
   detoxification of plant defense compounds. Three glucosinolate
   sulfatases (GSSs) or two sulfatase-modifying factors (SUMF1s) mutant
   strains were established on the basis of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to
   validate the existence of a species-specific GSSs-SUMF1s system. In
   comparison to the bioassay data from mutant strains of GSS1/GSS2 or
   SUMF1a/SUMF1b, GSS3 had a minimal role because no significant change was
   found in GSS3-/-under different feeding contexts. Antibody-based
   technologies were used to examine GSSs-related deficient strains, and
   the results showed that the GSS1 protein was primarily released through
   larval oral secretion. On the basis of high-performance liquid
   chromatography, we found that GSS1 was secreted to pre-desulfate the
   typical plant defensive glucosinolates known as 4(methylsulfinyl)butyl
   glucosinolate (4MSOB-GL) to suppress the production of the toxic
   substance, which is referred to as pre detoxification strategy. These
   findings highlighted that the GSSs-SUMF1s system is the key factor for
   counteradaptation of P. xylostella to cruciferous plants, which
   strengthens the concept that herbivores deploy pre-detoxification
   strategies to disrupt the plant chemical defenses to facilitate the
   colonization process.},

Abstract = {The immune system is based on the actions of the collection of
   specialized immune defense cells and their secreted proteins and
   peptides that defend the host against infection by parasites. Parasites
   are organisms that live part or all of their lives in close physical
   association with the host and extract nutrients from the host and, by
   releasing toxins and virulence factors, cause disease with the potential
   for injury and premature death of that host. Parasites of the metazoa
   can be viruses, eubacteria, fungi, protozoans, and other metazoans. The
   immune system operates to kill or eliminate parasites and eliminate or
   detoxify their toxins and virulence factors. Although some of the
   elements of immune systems are specific to a particular phylum of
   metazoans, others show extensive evolutionary conservation, being
   present in several or all major phyla of the metazoa. The pentraxins
   display this latter character in their roles in immune defense.
   Pentraxins have been documented in vertebrates, nonvertebrate chordates,
   arthropods, and mollusks and may be present in other taxa of metazoans.
   Presumably the pentraxins appeared early in the evolution of metazoa,
   prior to their evolutionary divergence in the Precambrian epoch into
   many phyla present today, and have been preserved for the 542 million
   years since that explosive evolutionary radiation. The fidelity with
   which these phyla have preserved the pentraxins suggests that the
   functions of these proteins are important for survival of the members of
   these diverse taxa of animals.},

Abstract = {Synthetic fragrance compounds have become a ubiquitous part of household
   cleaning products and personal care agents. To improve aesthetics,
   fragrances are added, but the current research has unveiled detrimental
   effects of these odorous compounds. The exposure to the synthetic
   fragrances and musks, which are produced in quantities of thousands of
   tons per year, has been shown to elicit several pathologies. The
   fragrance compounds are regarded as toxins by the human immune system,
   and to eliminate them, cytochrome enzymes, especially aromatases, are
   overexpressed. These enzymes also convert androgens into estrogens, but
   excess estrogen production affects the endocrine system in both males
   and females. Although the estrogenic properties of cosmetics are
   increasingly being proven, the link between fragrance compounds and a
   wide variety of modern lifestyle diseases is not known to the majority
   of the public. It is increasingly being evident that all diseases have
   common roots, i.e., inflammation. The unprecedented prevalence of
   diabetes, obesity, cancer, and depression, among others pathologies, is
   tied to the limitless usage of fragrance compounds. Therefore, it is
   important to further investigate the dangers associated with fragrance
   compounds, to inform the regulatory bodies to allow them to better
   control manufacturers, and to alert consumers. This article is directed
   for facilitation of that objective.},

Abstract = {There is only limited information about the accumulation of algal toxins
   in aquatic organisms in the Baltic Sea. In this study we measured total
   cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels in blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and
   flounderi (Platichthys flesus) tissues. Flounder were caught with
   gillnets from the western Gulf of Finland during July and August 1999.
   Blue mussels were collected from an enclosure at 3 m depth and from an
   artificial reef (wreck, 25-35 m depth) in the western Gulf of Finland
   between June and September 1999. Flounder liver and muscle samples and
   soft tissues of mussels were analyzed for the cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins (nodularin, NODLN and/or microcystins, MCs) using an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed a
   time-dependent accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder and mussels. In
   flounder, the maximum concentration 399 +/- 5 (sd) ng NODLN or MC/g dry
   weight (dw) was found in the liver of specimens caught on 21 August
   1999. No hepatotoxins were detected in muscle samples. The maximum
   concentration of 2150 ng +/- 60 (sd) ng hepatotoxin/g dw was found in
   the mussel soft tissues collected on 20 August 1999. Temporal NODLN or
   MC trends indicated depuration of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin from
   mussels at surface level and an increase in NODLN or MC concentrations
   in those from the sea bed. These studies showed that despite the low
   cyanobacteria cell numbers the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins can
   accumulate in flounder and mussels. This may allow the further transfer
   of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins in the food web. (C) 2001 by John Wiley

Abstract = {An investigation into the diversity of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   was carried out during August 2007 within two fjordic sea lochs in the
   Shetland Isles, Scotland. The co-occurrence in the water column of the
   non-toxic West European (W.E. or Gr.III) and the neurotoxic North
   American (N.A. or Gr.I) ribotypes of A. tamarense was demonstrated using
   fluorescent insitu hybridisation. A patch of A. tamarense (W. E.)
   localised at similar to 10 m depth and extending over 6 km was detected
   in `Clift Sound' with concentrations locally reaching similar to 1 x
   10(4) cells l(-1). A. tamarense (N.A.) was also observed there but
   despite the presence of toxins in net haul samples collected locally,
   concentrations were low and near limits of detection. Alexandrium
   concentrations were similar to 1.5 x 10(3) cells l(-1) in `Vaila Sound',
   where both W. E. and N.A. ribotypes were detected with equal relative
   abundances in some samples. Given the patchiness of A. tamarense
   populations and their possible organisation in thin layer structures,
   better vertical resolution through fine-scales ampling will be necessary
   for population dynamic studies. Implications for the shell fish industry
   are substantial since harmful micro algae patches may not be detected
   during routine monitoring. Moreover, the co-occurrence of
   morphologically indistinct toxic and non-toxic ribotypes will
   necessitate implementing molecular methods for their discrimination. (C)

Abstract = {Feeding rate, growth and nutritional condition as well as nodularin
   concentration of juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus
   aculeatus were assessed in an experimental study where field-collected
   fish were given a diet of zooplankton fed with toxic Nodularia spumigena
   for 15 days. Food consumption was higher in N. spumigena bloom
   conditions compared with the cyanobacterium-free control, but despite
   this the growth rate of exposed fish did not improve. Control fish and
   fish fed N. spumigena-exposed zooplankton had higher RNA:DNA ratios and
   protein content than fish grown in cyanobacterial bloom conditions
   indicating good nutritional condition and recent growth of fish, whereas
   in bloom conditions metabolic transformation of nodularin to less toxic
   compounds may cause an energetic cost to the fish affecting the growth
   rate of the whole organism. Juvenile three-spined sticklebacks collected
   from the field contained higher concentrations of nodularin at the
   beginning of the experiment (mean 503.1 mu g kg(-1)). After 15 days, the
   lowest nodularin concentrations in fish were measured in the control
   treatment, suggesting that fish fed with non-toxic food are able to
   detoxify nodularin from their tissues more effectively than fish in
   continuing exposure. (c) 2008 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2008

   sp. to evaluate the effects of the harmful alga on the mussels and to
   study recovery after discontinuation of the A. fundyense exposure.
   Mussels were exposed for 9 days to the different algae and then all were
   fed Rhodomonas sp. for 6 more days. Samples of hemolymph for hemocyte
   analyses and tissues for histology were collected before the exposure
   and periodically during exposure and recovery periods.
   Mussels filtered and ingested both microalgal cultures, producing fecal
   pellets containing degraded, partially degraded, and intact cells of
   both algae. Mussels exposed to A. fundyense had an inflammatory response
   consisting of degranulation and diapedesis of hemocytes into the
   alimentary canal and, as the exposure continued, hemocyte migration into
   the connective tissue between the gonadal follicles. Evidence of lipid
   peroxidation, similar to the detoxification pathway described for
   various xenobiotics, was found; insoluble lipofuchsin granules formed
   (ceroidosis), and hemocytes carried the granules to the alimentary
   canal, thus eliminating putative dinoflagellate toxins in feces. As the
   number of circulating hemocytes in A. fundyense-exposed mussels became
   depleted, mussels were immunocompromised, and pathological changes
   followed, i.e., increased prevalences of ceroidosis and trematodes after
   9 days of exposure. Moreover, the total number of pathological changes
   increased from the beginning of the exposure until the last day (day 9).
   After 6 days of the exposure, mussels in one of the three tanks exposed
   to A. fundyense mass spawned; these mussels showed more severe effects
   of the toxic algae than non-spawning mussels exposed to A. fundyense.
   No significant differences were found between the two treatments during
   the recovery period, indicating rapid homeostatic processes in tissues
   and circulating hemocytes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The estuarine genus Pfiesteria has received considerable attention since
   it was first identified and proposed to be the causative agent of fish
   kills along the mid-Atlantic coast in 1992. The presumption has been
   that the mechanism of fish death is by release of one or more toxins by
   the dinoflagellate. In this report, we challenge the notion that
   Pfiesteria species produce ichthyotoxins. Specifically, we show that (i)
   simple centrifugation, with and without ultrasonication, is sufficient
   to ``detoxify{''} water of actively fish-killing cultures of Pfiesteria
   shumwayae, (ii) organic extracts of lyophilized cultures are not toxic
   to fish, (fit) degenerate primers that amplify PKS genes from several
   polyketide-producing dinoflagellates failed to yield a product with A
   shumwayae DNA or cDNA, and (iv) degenerate primers for NRPS genes failed
   to amplify any NRPS genes but (unexpectedly) yielded a band (among
   several) that corresponded to known or putative PKSs and fatty acid
   synthases. We conclude that P. shumwayae is able to kill fish by means
   other than releasing a toxin into bulk water. Alternative explanations
   of the effects attributed to Pfiesteria are suggested.},

Title = {Microcystin-leucine arginine exposure induced intestinal lipid
   accumulation and MC-LR efflux disorder in Lithobates catesbeianus
   tadpoles},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {465},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Few studies exist on the toxic effects of chronic exposure to
   microcystins (MCs) on amphibian intestines, and the toxicity mechanisms
   are unclear. Here, we evaluated the impact of subchronic exposure (30
   days) to environmentally realistic microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR)
   concentrations (0 mu g/L, 0.5 mu g/L and 2 mu g/L) on tadpole
   (Lithobates catesbeianus) intestines by analyzing the histopathological
   and subcellular microstructural damage, the antioxidative and oxidative
   enzyme activities, and the transcriptome levels. Histopathological
   results showed severe damage accompanied by inflammation to the
   intestinal tissues as the MC-LR exposure concentration increased from
   0.5 mu g/L to 2 mu g/L. RNA-sequencing analysis identified 634 and 1,147
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after exposure to 0.5 mu g/L and 2
   mu g/L MC-LR, respectively, compared with those of the control group (0
   mu g/L). Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and the peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway were
   upregulated in the intestinal tissues of the exposed groups, with many
   lipid droplets being observed on transmission electron microscopy,
   implying that MC-LR may induce lipid accumulation in frog intestines.
   Moreover, 2 mu g/L of MC-LR exposure inhibited the xenobiotic and
   toxicant biodegradation related to detoxification, implying that the
   tadpoles' intestinal detoxification ability was weakened after exposure
   to 2 mu g/L MC-LR, which may aggravate intestinal toxicity. Lipid
   accumulation and toxin efflux disorder may be caused by MC-LR-induced
   endoplasmic reticular stress. This study presents new evidence that
   MC-LR harms amphibians by impairing intestinal lipid metabolism and
   toxin efflux, providing a theoretical basis for evaluating the health
   risks of MC-LR to amphibians.},

Title = {Antibody response and protection of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   immunised with an extracellular polysaccharide of Aeromonas salmonicida},
Journal = {FISH \& SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Immunisation of Atlantic salmon with hot phenol-extracted polysaccharide
   from the broth-culture supernatant of Aeromonas salmonicida led to
   protection against experimental challenge by virulent A. salmonicida.
   Significant protection was not achieved by immunisation with
   lipopolysaccharide extracted from the;cell wall (CWLPS) of the
   bacterium. The biochemical composition of the hot phenol extract of the
   culture supernatant was compared with the hot phenol extract of the
   bacterial cells (CWLPS). Protein content of the two materials was
   negligible while hexose content and lipid was significant. SDS-PAGE gels
   stained with silver or periodic acid-silver showed different patterns.
   The endotoxin content was titrated using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate
   assay and determined to be at least 10(3) times higher for the CWLPS
   than the culture supernatant material. Unlike the CWLPS the
   extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) was not adsorbed onto detoxi-gels and
   was not precipitated by dextran-sulphate (a lipid adsorbent) indicating
   the EPS to be lipid free. Determination of the sugar constituents of EPS
   and CWLPS by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated
   major differences particularly in mannose (a major constituent of the
   EPS) and heptose (absent in EPS). Salmon antisera to EPS and CWLPS
   showed a high degree of specificity to the homologous antigen indicating
   an ability of the salmon immune response to distinguish the two
   antigens. Salmon antiserum to EPS, but not to CWLPS, was capable of
   passively protecting salmon against the lethal toxicity of phenyl methyl
   sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF)-treated extracellular products and to
   challenge by virulent bacteria. These results suggest that salmon
   antibodies to EPS may protect the fish by neutralising the lethal
   glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyl transferase (GCAT) toxin which may
   be complexed with the EPS during infection by A. salmonicida. Protection
   was correlated with high levels of anti-EPS antibodies which are
   achieved only with immunising doses of extracted EPS higher than the
   concentration which was achieved in the broth cultures of A.
   salmonicida. Indeed, bacterins made from formalinised whole cultures
   induced little antibody to EPS. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

Abstract = {Zearalenone (ZEN) is a widespread mycotoxin found in grain and feed,
   presenting a serious threat to animal and human health. This study
   investigated the ability of the novel strain B73, isolated from

   Bacillus spizizenii through physiological and biochemical tests, and
   further confirmed based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the complete
   genome sequence. B. spizizenii B73 was capable of degrading up to 99.3\%
   of ZEN at a concentration of 10 mu g/mL in a minimal medium (pH = 7.0)
   within 8 h at 37 degrees C via HPLC-UV. In addition, B. spizizenii B73
   was used to treat ZEN-contaminated wheat bran, dried distillers grains
   (DDGS), and corn meal, whereby the respective degradation rates reached
   96.32\%, 98.73\%, and 80.31\% after 36 h of treatment.
   HPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS analysis revealed one of the degradation products
   to have the formula C17H24O4. B. spizizenii B73 is a novel strain
   isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil, and the extracellular enzymes
   secreted by this strain show a remarkable ability to degrade ZEN.},

Title = {Biochemical and growth performance of the aquatic macrophyte Azolla
   filiculoides to sub-chronic exposure to cylindrospermopsin},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {9},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Physiological and biochemical effects of cylindrospermopsin (CYN), a
   cyanobacterial toxin that inhibits protein synthesis and released during
   a harmful cyanobacterial bloom, has been overlooked in plants.
   Therefore, at the present research, the toxic effects (physiological and
   biochemical) of a crude extract containing CYN were assessed in the
   aquatic fern Azolla filiculoides exposed to three concentrations (0.05,
   0.5 and 5 mu g CYN mL(-1)). At 5 mu g CYN mL(-1), fern growth rate has
   showed a drastic decrease (0.001 g g(-1) day(-1)) corresponding to a
   99.8 \% inhibition, but at the concentrations of 0.05 and 0.5 mu g CYN
   mL(-1) the growth rate was similar to the control plants. Growth rate
   also indicated a IC50 of 2.9 mu g CYN mL(-1). Those data point to the
   presence of other compounds in the crude extract may stimulate the fern
   growth and/or the fern is tolerant to CYN. Chlorophyll (a and b),
   carotenoids and protein content as well as the activities of glutathione
   reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) has increased at 5 mu
   g CYN mL(-1) which may indicate that photosynthesis and protein
   synthesis are not affected by CYN and the probable activation of defense
   and detoxifying mechanisms to overcome the effects induced by the
   presence of CYN. Low uptake of cylindrospermopsin (1.314 mu g CYN g(-1)
   FW) and low bioconcentration factor (0.401) point towards to a safe use
   of A. filiculoides as biofertilizer and as food source, but also
   indicate that the fern is not suitable for CYN phytoremediation.},

Abstract = {A second toxic species within the family Pfiesteriaceae, Pfiesteria
   shumwayae Glas.-ow \& Burkholder sp. nov., is described from the New
   River Estuary and the Neuse Estuary of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine
   Ecosystem, USA. The species is polymorphic and multiphasic, with
   flagellated, amoeboid and cyst stages. The flagellated zoospores
   (diameter 8-24 mum) have permanently condensed chromosomes (mesokaryotic
   nucleus); a chrysophyte-like cyst (diameter 6-25 mum) With organic
   scales and bracts; and thin thecal plates arranged in a Kofoidian series
   of Po, cp, X, 4', 1a, 6{''}, 6c, 4s, 5{''}', 2''''. The benthic
   filopodial (filose), lobopodial (lobose) and rhizopodial amoeboid stages
   (5-250 mum) have an outer covering that ranges from rough to smooth in
   texture, depending on the stage of origin and the prey source,
   Pfiesteria shumwayae amoebae have a normal eukaryote nucleus and cysts
   of multiple sizes (diameter 4-25 mum) With a reticulate outer covering,
   Toxic strains of the two Pfiesteria species have overlapping
   distributions in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States and
   Scandinavia, with toxic P. shumwayae also having been verified from New
   Zealand. Pfiesteria shumwayae is similar to P. piscicida in its complex
   life cycle, general nutrition, attraction to live fish prey, and
   ichthyotoxic activity that is stimulated by the presence of live fish or
   their fresh tissues and excreta. However, it can be distinguished from
   P. piscicida morphologically by having six precingular plates and a
   four-sided I a plate, as well as genetically, on the basis of its 18S
   ribosomal DNA sequence.},

Abstract = {Apoptosis is a natural process occurring during the development of
   central nervous system resulting in the elimination of neurons that may
   have formed faulty synapses. Apoptosis can also be triggered by
   deprivation of growth factors or by exposure to a variety of endogenous
   or exogenous compounds. Several methods exist to assess apoptosis in
   neuronal cells. The choice of a particular method for apoptosis
   detection is dependent on the cell system, the nature of the toxin or
   toxicant, the type of information being sought, and, finally, on
   technical limitations. In this chapter, we describe techniques to
   evaluate apoptosis in primary neuronal cell cultures based on the
   evaluation of three criteria: cell morphology, biochemical changes, and
   DNA degradation. To draw correct conclusions regarding the mode of cell
   death, a combination of some of the methods mentioned above should be
   used.},

Abstract = {The contribution of picocyanobacteria to summer phytoplankton blooms,
   accompanied by an ecological crisis, is a new phenomenon in Europe. This
   issue requires careful investigation. We studied allelopathic activity
   of freshwater picocyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. on phytoplankton
   assemblages from three freshwater lakes. In this study, the allelopathic
   activity of the Synechococcus sp. on the total abundance, biomass, as
   well as structure of the phytoplankton assemblages were investigated.
   Our results indicated that addition of exudates obtained from
   Synechococcus sp. affected the number of cells and biomass of the
   phytoplankton communities; the degree of inhibition or stimulation was
   different for each species, causing a change in the phytoplankton
   abundance and dominance during the experiment. We observed that some
   group of organisms (especially cyanobacteria from the genus Aphanothece,
   Limnothrix, Microcystis, and Synechococcus) showed tolerance for
   allelopathic compounds produced and released by Synechococcus sp. It is
   also worth noting that in some samples, Bacillariophyceae (e.g., Amphora
   pediculus, Navicula pygmaea, and Nitzschia paleacea) were completely
   eliminated in the experimental treatments, while present in the
   controls. This work demonstrated that the allelopathic activity
   exhibited by the Synechococcus sp. is probably one of the major
   competitive strategies affecting some of the coexisting phytoplankton
   species in freshwater ecosystems. To our best knowledge this is the
   first report of the allelopathic activity of Synechococcus sp. in the
   freshwater reservoirs, and one of the few published works showing
   allelopathic properties of freshwater picocyanobacteria on coexisting
   phytoplankton species.},

   CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SHELLFISH FARMING SECTOR IN BOURGNEUF BAY (FRANCE)},

Abstract = {The economic impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on the shellfish
   farming sector depend on their frequency, duration and intensity.
   Safeguarding storage and accelerated detoxification are technical
   solutions that could mitigate the effects of these events. This article
   first analyzes the economic feasibility of the technological changes
   that can be adopted by the shellfish farming sector in France. It then
   examines their associated social impacts. Finally, an application is
   carried out on the Bourgneuf Bay production area. The economic analysis
   addresses three issues related to HABs: (1) the economic performance of
   the shellfish farms in Bourgneuf Bay, (2) the costs of these new
   technologies, and (3) the economic viability of such an investment.
   Results suggest that only a few economically viable farms would be able
   to implement these technologies, yet this would not be an option for
   smaller, less profitable farms. Individual action within the context of
   a laissez-faire public policy, taking into account the need for
   technological equipment, would result in a concentration of the sector
   to the benefit of the largest capitalist farms, with negative effects on
   employment and the distribution of economic rent. Alternative ways for
   implementing these technological changes would require collective
   actions or public support.},

Abstract = {The epidermal mucus protects fish against harmful environmental factors
   and the loss of physiological metabolites and water. It is an efficient
   barrier between the fish and the biosphere. The integrity of the skin
   mucus is thus of vital importance for the welfare and survival of the
   fish. Since excreted proteins and small molecules in the mucus can
   mirror the health status of the fish, it is a valuable matrix for
   monitoring stress, pathogen exposure, and nutritional effects. Several
   methods for sampling epidermal mucus from different fish species have
   previously been described, but information about their efficiency or the
   comparability of mucus analyses is lacking. In the present study, skin
   mucus from farmed Atlantic salmon was therefore sampled by three
   methods, including absorption or wiping with tissue paper, and scraping
   with a blunt blade, and the mucus proteome was analyzed by ultra-high
   pressure liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. The
   measured protein contents, numbers, compositions and the observed data
   quality were compared between sampling methods. Furthermore, functional
   annotation and classification of the identified proteins was performed.
   The results showed that the three skin mucus sample types differed
   qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The absorbed mucus was the
   least tainted by proteins resulting from damage inflicted to the fish
   epidermis by the sampling procedure. Wiped mucus showed a better protein
   yield than absorbed and delivered a larger proteome of identifiable
   proteins, with less contamination from epithelial proteins than observed
   for scraped mucus. We recommend that future research of mucus should use
   the absorption method in cases, where it is important that the mucus is
   devoid of proteins from the underlying epithelium, and the wiping
   method, when protein yield is crucial or when the proteome of the outer
   epithelium is of interest.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {162-169},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Anatoxin-a is a neurotoxin produced by various bloom-forming
   cyanobacteria. Although it shows widespread occurrence and is highly
   toxic to rodents, its mechanisms of action and biotransformation, and
   effects in fish species are still poorly understood. The main aim of
   this study was, thus, to investigate sub-lethal effects of anatoxin-a on
   selected biochemical markers in rainbow trout fry in order to get
   information about the mechanisms of toxicity and biotransformation of
   this toxin in fish. Trout fry were administered sub-lethal doses of
   anatoxin-a (0.08-0.31 mu g g(-1)) intraperitoneally. Livers and muscle
   tissue were collected 72 h later for quantification of key enzyme
   activities as biochemical markers. Enzymes assessed in muscle tissues
   were related to cholinergic transmission (acetylcholinesterase
   {[}AChE]), energy metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase {[}LDH] and
   NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase PHI). Enzymes assessed in the
   liver were involved in biotransformation (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase
   {[}EROD] and glutathione S-transferases {[}GST]). The results indicated
   a significant increasing trend for AChE activity with the dose of
   anatoxin-a, possibly representing an attempt to cope with
   overstimulation of muscle activity by the toxin, which competes with
   acetylcholine for nicotinic receptors binding. Anatoxin-a was also found
   to significantly induce the activities of liver EROD and GST, indicating
   the involvement of phase I and II biotransformation in its
   detoxification. Likewise, lactate dehydrogenase activity recorded in fry
   muscle increased significantly with the dose of anatoxin-a, suggesting
   an induction of the anaerobic pathway of energy production to deal with
   toxic stress induced by the exposure. Altogether, the results suggest
   that under continued exposure in the wild fish may experience motor
   difficulties, possibly becoming vulnerable to predators, and be at
   increased metabolic demand to cope with energetic requirements imposed
   by anatoxin-a biotransformation mechanisms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the Baltic Sea have multiple effects on organisms that
   influence the food chain dynamics on several trophic levels.
   Cyanobacteria contain several bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids,
   peptides, and lipopolysaccharides. A group of nonribosomally produced
   oligopeptides, namely microcystins and nodularin, are tumor promoters
   and cause oxidative stress in the affected cells. Zooplankton graze on
   cyanobacteria, and when ingested, the hepatotoxins (nodularin) decrease
   the egg production of, for example, copepods. However, the observed
   effects are very variable, because many crustaceans are tolerant to
   nodularin and because cyanobacteria may complement the diet of grazers
   in small amounts. Cyanobacterial toxins are transferred through the food
   web from one trophic level to another. The transfer rate is relatively
   low in the pelagic food web but reduced feeding and growth rates of fish
   larvae have been observed. In the benthic food web, especially in blue
   mussels, nodularin concentrations are high, and benthic feeding juvenile
   flounders have been observed to disappear from bloom areas. In the
   littoral ecosystem, gammarids have shown increased mortality and
   weakening of reproductive success under cyanobacterial exposure. In
   contrast, mysid shrimps seem to be tolerant to cyanobacterial exposure.
   In fish larvae, detoxication of nodularin poses a metabolic cost that is
   reflected as decreased growth and condition, which may increase their
   susceptibility to predation. Cyanobacterial filaments and aggregates
   also interfere with both hydromechanical and visual feeding of
   planktivores. The feeding appendages of mysid shrimps may clog, and the
   filaments interfere with prey detection of pike larvae. On the other
   hand, a cyanobacterial bloom may provide a refuge for both zooplankton
   and small fish. As the decaying bloom also provides an ample source of
   organic carbon and nutrients for the organisms of the microbial loop,
   the zooplankton species capable of selective feeding may thrive in bloom
   conditions. Cyanobacteria also compete for nutrients with other primary
   producers and change the nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) balance of their
   environment by their N-fixation. Further, the bioactive compounds of
   cyanobacteria directly influence other primary producers, favoring
   cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates, and nanoflagellates and
   inhibiting cryptophytes. As the selective grazers also shift the grazing
   pressure on other species than cyanobacteria, changes in the structure
   and functioning of the Baltic Sea communities and ecosystems are likely
   to occur during the cyanobacterial bloom season.},

Title = {Innovative approaches for Microcystin removal: Bacterioplankton
   biodegradation and multi-soil-layering system performance assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {452},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) pose a significant threat to human health and the
   environment due to their persistence and toxicity as potent
   cyanobacterial toxins. Effective biodegradation strategies are required
   for their removal and detoxification. In this study, bacterioplankton
   were isolated from eutrophic reservoir water used for crop irrigation
   and tested for their ability to degrade MCs. These bacteria are
   hydrologically transported from the contaminated reservoir to downstream
   farms where they are able to grow under the favorable conditions
   provided by a multi -soil -layering (MSL) system, a low-cost and locally
   applicable ecotechnology for the removal and detoxification of MCs.
   These bacteria enhance the ability of the MSL to remove MCs by forming
   biofilms within the MSL system. The bacterial strains were then
   sequenced and their partial 16S rRNA was compared to the reference
   strains in the NCBI database. The effectiveness of the MSL system in the
   removal of MCs from water was evaluated. The MSL utilizes a layered soil
   matrix that promotes microbial growth and physicochemical interactions
   that enable the removal of various contaminants. The mechanisms of MC
   removal in the MSL were evaluated by studying the physicochemical
   properties of the system substrate before and after treatment using Xray
   fluorescence, zeta potential, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   analyses. The microbial functional groups, including ammonifying and
   denitrifying bacteria, were also investigated in the MSL soil matrices
   before and after treatment. The results showed that seven bacterial
   strains exhibited high MC degradation capabilities, with MC degradation
   performance exceeding 97\%. These isolated bacterial strains had a
   nucleotide identity score of 100\% and an E value of 0.0 compared to
   reference strains. The MSL showed a 99\% removal rate for MCLR and
   MC-YR, as well as significant reductions in other pollutants, including
   COD (60\%), BOD5 (60\%), chlorophyll -a (96\%), pheophytin (70\%),
   organic nitrogen (80\%), and nitrites (90\%). After treatment, there was
   a statistically significant increase in the total bacterial count, as
   well as ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria, in the MSL soil matrices
   compared to their state before treatment. SEM analyses revealed the
   formation of dense biofilm microbiota, indicating additional biological
   processes besides adsorption for MC reduction. Overall, the MSL provides
   a low-cost alternative for the removal of MCs and cyanobacteria with
   minimal resource requirements and maintenance. It offers a promising
   solution for mitigating toxic cyanobacterial blooms, ensuring safe
   agricultural water reuse.},

Title = {Pendimethalin Nitroreductase Is Responsible for the Initial
   Pendimethalin Degradation Step in Bacillus subtilis Y3},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {24},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pendimethalin {[}N-(1-ethylpropyl)-2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine] is a
   selective preemergence dinitroaniline herbicide. Several fungi and
   bacteria have been reported to degrade pendimethalin, but the enzymes or
   genes involved in this process have not been characterized.
   Nitroreduction is the initial degradation and detoxification step for
   pendimethalin. In this study, a pendimethalin nitroreductase (PNR),
   responsible for the nitroreduction of pendimethalin, was purified from
   the pendimethalin-degrading strain Bacillus subtilis Y3. Based on a
   comparison of its mass fingerprints with all of the deduced proteins
   from the draft genome of strain Y3, a protein annotated as a
   nitroreductase was identified, and its corresponding encoding gene was
   termed pnr. PNR was a functional homodimer with a subunit molecular mass
   of approximately 23 kDa. PNR reduced the C-6 nitro group of the aromatic
   ring of pendimethalin, yielding
   2-nitro-6-amino-N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4-xylidine. PNR could also catalyze
   the nitroreduction of three other major varieties of dinitroaniline
   herbicides, including butralin, oryzalin, and trifluralin. However, the
   number of reduced nitro groups was two instead of one, which differed
   from the nitroreduction of pendimethalin by PNR and which may be due to
   the symmetry in the chemical structures of the two nitro groups. A
   detoxification assay revealed that
   2-nitro-6-amino-N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4-xylidine (PNR-reduced
   pendimethalin) showed no inhibitory effect on the growth of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, whereas pendimethalin showed an obvious
   inhibitory effect on its growth, indicating the detoxification effect of
   pendimethalin by PNR. Therefore, PNR has potential in pendimethalin
   detoxification applications. This report describes an enzyme (and
   corresponding gene) involved in the biodegradation of pendimethalin and
   dinitroaniline herbicides.
   IMPORTANCE
   Pendimethalin {[}N-(1-ethylpropyl)-2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine] is a widely
   used selective preemergence dinitroaniline herbicide, and its residue
   has been frequently detected in the environment. The U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) has classified pendimethalin as a persistent
   bioaccumulative toxin. To date, no enzymes or genes involved in
   pendimethalin biodegradation have been reported. In the present study,
   the gene pnr, which encodes the nitroreductase PNR, responsible for the
   nitroreduction of pendimethalin, was cloned from the
   pendimethalin-degrading strain Bacillus subtilis Y3. PNR could also
   catalyze the nitroreduction of three other major varieties of
   dinitroaniline herbicides, including butralin, oryzalin, and
   trifluralin. The reduction of pendimethalin by PNR might eliminate its
   toxicity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, indicating the
   application potential of PNR in the detoxification of pendimethalin.},

Title = {A highly conserved SusCD transporter determines the import and

Abstract = {Efficient interbacterial competitions and diverse defensive strategies
   employed by various bacteria play a crucial role in acquiring a hold
   within a dense microbial community. The gut symbiont Bacteroides
   fragilis secretes an antimicrobial ubiquitin homologue (BfUbb) that
   targets an essential periplasmic PPIase to drive intraspecies bacterial
   competition. However, the mechanisms by which BfUbb enters the periplasm
   and its potential for interspecies antagonism remain poorly understood.
   Here, we employ transposon mutagenesis and identify a highly conserved
   TonB-dependent transporter SusCD (designated as ButCD) in B. fragilis as
   the BfUbb transporter. As a putative protein-related nutrient
   utilization system, ButCD is widely distributed across diverse
   Bacteroides species with varying sequence similarity, resulting in
   distinct import efficiency of Bacteroides ubiquitin homologues (BUbb)
   and thereby determining the species-specific toxicity of BUbb. Cryo-EM
   structural and functional investigations of the BfUbb-ButCD complex
   uncover distinctive structural features of ButC that are crucial for its
   targeting by BfUbb. Animal studies further demonstrate the specific and
   efficient elimination of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) in the
   murine gut by BfUbb, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic against
   ETBF-associated inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Our
   findings provide a comprehensive elucidation of the species-specific
   toxicity exhibited by BUbb and explore its potential applications.},

Abstract = {The bacterio-insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti)
   represents currently a safe alternative to chemical insecticides in
   mosquito-borne diseases control and is intensively used worldwide. In
   the French Rhone-alpine mosquito Aedes rusticus Rossi, several genomic
   signatures of selection were detected in populations treated for more
   than 15 years with Bti. In this study we investigated whether
   detoxifying enzyme activities such as cytochromes P450, esterases and
   glutathione S-transferases can play a role in Bti resistance mechanisms
   in these populations. To examine the effect of Bti treatment on larval
   resistance and detoxifying enzyme activities, Bti mortality and
   enzymatic activities were measured in treated and untreated sites coming
   from four different locations in the Rhone-Alpes region. The results
   revealed a significant global decrease in Bti mortality in treated
   populations, but showed low resistance ratio up to 7.9-fold between
   treated and untreated sites. A positive correlation has been observed
   between larval resistance to Bti and glutathione S-transferase
   activities, raising the question of its potential role in Bti
   resistance. A better understanding of all the mechanisms potentially
   involved in Bti resistance is necessary to insure the long-term
   efficiency of this bacterio-insecticide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {As filter-feeders, bivalves naturally come into direct contact with
   microcystins ( MCs) in eutrophic water bodies suffering from
   cyanobacteria blooms. To date, however, no studies have quantified the
   dynamics of microcystin accumulation and depuration in the edible
   freshwater bivalve Corbicula fluminea when exposed to dense bloom
   concentrations of Microcystis aeruginosa, while considering dynamic
   changes of biochemical indexes and feeding structure. In the present
   study, the bioaccumulation and detoxification of microcystin-LR (MC-LR)
   in C. fluminea were investigated. Our results showed that C. fluminea
   would graze equally efficiently on green algae and M. aeruginosa,
   irrespective of whether the M. aeruginosa strains were toxic or
   non-toxic. MCs could be accumulated and depurated by C. fluminea
   efficiently. In addition, linear and exposure time-dependent MC-LR
   accumulation patterns were observed in C. fluminea. Activities of
   biotransformation (glutathione S- transferase, GST) and antioxidant
   enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and catalase, CAT) and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in various tissues of treated clams were
   stimulated by MCs in a tissue-specific manner. Our findings indicated
   that C. fluminea hepatopancreas was the primary target organ for MC-LR
   detoxification processes, as evidenced by a significant increase in GST
   activity. Besides, gills and mantle were more sensitive than the other
   tissues to oxidative stress in the initial microcystin exposure period
   with a significant increase in SOD activity. The scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that the lateral cilia in the
   gill aperture were well developed during the MCs exposure period, which
   could perform the filter-feeding function instead of the damaged frontal
   cilium. This study provides insight into the possible tolerance of C.
   fluminea exposed to dense bloom concentrations of M. aeruginosa.},

Title = {Isolation and Optimization of Aflatoxin B1 Degradation by

   Kocuria rosea Strain 13},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Aflatoxin B-1 is a natural carcinogenic mycotoxin. The biological
   detoxification of aflatoxin could result in less environmental
   pollution, more moderate conditions, and less impact on food and feed,
   and be more convenient than physical and chemical methods. In this
   study, strain 13 with aflatoxin B1 degradation activity (67.47 +/-
   1.44\%) was isolated and identified as Kocuria rosea. A uniform design
   was applied to optimize the degradation activity using a software Data
   Processing System, and a quadratic polynomial stepwise regression model
   was selected to investigate the relationships between the degradation
   rate and five independent variables. Furthermore, the optimal
   degradation conditions (culture temperature of 30 degrees C, culture
   time of 4.2 days, seawater ratio of 100\%, pH of 7.11, and inoculation
   dosage of 0.09\%) were verified with a degradation rate of 88 +/-
   0.03\%, which was well matched with the predicted value (92.97\%) of the
   model. Complete genome sequencing of Kocuria rosea, conducted with a
   combination of Illumina and single-molecule real-time sequencing, was
   used to analyze the genomic features and functions of the strain, which
   were predicted by the annotation based on seven databases, and may
   provide insights into the potential of Kocuria rosea, as well as
   providing a reference for degradation gene and protein mining. These
   results indicate that Kocuria rosea strain 13 has the ability to degrade
   aflatoxin B-1 efficiently, and it also has the potential to provide
   aflatoxin-degrading enzymes.},

Abstract = {Microcystin-LR ( MC-LR) is the most frequently studied cyclic
   heptapeptide hepatotoxin produced by cyanobacteria. The toxin
   accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage, but
   the molecular mechanisms behind its toxicity remain unclear. Here,
   suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify
   alterations in gene transcription of the silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys
   molitrix) after exposure to MC-LR. After hybridization and cloning, the
   forward and reverse subtractive cDNA libraries were obtained. At random,
   150 positive clones (70 forward and 80 reverse) were selected and
   sequenced from the subtractive libraries, which gave a total of 88 gene
   fragment sequences (48 forward and 40 reverse). Sequencing analysis and
   homology searches showed that these ESTs represented 75 unique genes and
   13 duplicates. Of the 75 unique genes, 38 shared high homology with fish
   genes of known functions, including immune-related genes, transporters
   and some involved in cell metabolism. Four sequenced genes (Fs59, Es70,
   Rs2 and Rs15) were analyzed further using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The
   genes from the forward library (Fs59 and Fs70) were found to be
   transcriptionally upregulated, while the genes from the reverse library
   (Rs2 and Rs15) were found to be transcriptionally downregulated. These
   results confirmed the successful construction of the subtractive cDNA
   library that was enriched for genes that were differentially transcribed
   in the silver carp liver challenged with MC-LR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The transfer and transformation of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   from scallop Chlamys nobilis to spiny lobster Panulirus stimpsoni were
   investigated in the present study. The results demonstrate that transfer
   and transformation of PSP toxins occurred when Panulirus stimpsoni were
   fed with toxic viscera of Chlamys nobilis, but depurated with non-toxic
   squids. Additionally, only the lobster hepatopancreas were found to
   contain PSP, and the toxin profiles were the same with those in the
   viscera of the scallop, including carbamate toxins (GTX(1-3)),
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C1+2 and B-1) and decarbamoyl toxins (dcGTX(2 +
   3)). Unlike the lobster, the scallop contained more alpha than beta
   toxins. After being fed with toxic Chlamys nobili for 6 d, Panulirus
   stimpsoni selectively accumulated N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins with low
   toxicity. However, when they were depurated with non-toxic squid,
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins tended to transform into carbamate toxins with
   higher toxicity. The concentration of dcGTX(2 + 3) in Panulirus
   stimpsoni decreased significantly and wasn't detectable after depuration
   for 6 d, which was likely due to their initial low accumulation of
   toxins. These results reveal that PSP could be transferred and
   transformed in Crustaceans along the given food chain under the
   conditions of laboratory, but there are many questions remained to be
   solved, and the further studies should be carried out. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {Dissolved Microcystin Release Coincident with Lysis of a Bloom Dominated
   by Microcystis spp. in Western Lake Erie Attributed to a Novel
   Cyanophage},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Western Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes) is prone to annual
   cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by Microcystis
   spp. that often yield microcystin toxin concentrations exceeding the
   federal EPA recreational contact advisory of 8 mu g liter(-1). In August
   2014, microcystin levels were detected in finished drinking water above
   the World Health Organization 1.0 tcg liter(-1) threshold for
   consumption, leading to a 2-day disruption in the supply of drinking
   water for >400,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio (USA). Subsequent
   metatranscriptomic analysis of the 2014 bloom event provided evidence
   that release of toxin into the water supply was likely caused by
   cyanophage lysis that transformed a portion of the intracellular
   microcystin pool into the dissolved fraction, rendering it more
   difficult to eliminate during treatment. In August 2019, a similar
   increase in dissolved microcystins at the Toledo water intake was
   coincident with a viral lytic event caused by a phage consortium
   different in composition from what was detected following the 2014
   Toledo water crisis. The most abundant viral sequence in metagenomic
   data sets was a scaffold from a putative member of the Siphoviridae,
   distinct from the Ma-LMM01-like Myoviridae that are typically documented
   to occur in western Lake Erie. This study provides further evidence that
   viral activity in western Lake Erie plays a significant role in
   transformation of microcystins from the particulate to the dissolved
   fraction and therefore requires monitoring efforts from local water
   treatment plants. Additionally, identification of multiple lytic
   cyanophages will enable the development of a quantitative PCR toolbox to
   assess viral activity during cHABs.
   IMPORTANCE Viral attack on cHABs may contribute to changes in community
   composition during blooms, as well as bloom decline, yet loss of bloom
   biomass does not eliminate the threat of cHAB toxicity. Rather, it may
   increase risks to the public by delivering a pool of dissolved toxin
   directly into water treatment utilities when the dominating Microcystis
   spp. are capable of producing microcystins. Detecting, characterizing,
   and quantifying the major cyanophages involved in lytic events will
   assist water treatment plant operators in making rapid decisions
   regarding the pool of microcystins entering the plant and the
   corresponding best practices to neutralize the toxin.},

Abstract = {A variety of studies indicated that inorganic arsenic and its methylated
   metabolites have paradoxical effects, namely, carcinogenic and
   anticancer effects. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term
   exposure to arsenic can increase the risk of cancers of lung, skin or
   bladder in man, which is probably associated with the arsenic
   metabolism. In fact, the enzymatic conversion of inorganic arsenic by
   Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) to mono-and
   dimethylated arsenic species has long been considered as a major route
   for detoxification. However, several studies have also indicated that
   biomethylation of inorganic arsenic, particularly the production of
   trivalent methylated metabolites, is a process that activates arsenic as
   a toxin and a carcinogen. On the other hand, arsenic trioxide (As2O3)
   has recently been recognized as one of the most effective drugs for the
   treatment of APL. However, elaboration of the cytotoxic mechanisms of
   arsenic and its methylated metabolites in eradicating cancer is sorely
   lacking. To provide a deeper understanding of the toxicity and
   carcinogenicity along with them use of arsenic in chemotherapy, caution
   is required considering the poor understanding of its various mechanisms
   of exerting toxicity. Thereby, in this review, we have focused on
   arsenic metabolic pathway, the roles of the methylated arsenic
   metabolites in toxicity and in the therapeutic efficacy for the
   treatments of solid tumors, APL and/ or non-APL malignancies.},

Title = {Sequencing and analysis of four BAC clones containing innate immune
   genes from the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri)},

Abstract = {The sequencing of BAC clones (similar to 100 kb) can reveal some
   characteristics of a genome that are challenging to obtain based on
   short sequences. Additionally, although the immune genes of the Zhikong
   scallop (Chlamys farreri) have been studied widely, few analyses have
   been conducted at the DNA level. In this study, four C. farreri BAC
   clones containing innate immune genes, including hsp70, Igbp
   (lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan binding protein), serine
   protease and a gene with an immunoglobulin-like domain, were sequenced
   and analyzed both to explore the genomic characteristics of C. farreri
   based on long DNA sequences and to promote the study of C. farreri
   immune genes at the DNA level. The total length of the four BACs was
   389.98 kb. A total of 34 genes were predicted in these sequences, and
   several features of protein-coding regions in the C. farreri genome were
   inferred based on this information. Two LGBP genes Were located close
   together in a 22-kb region in one BAC clone, indicating the physical
   linkage of some immune genes in C. farreri. A cluster of membrane
   transport genes was also observed; these genes might play important
   roles in eliminating toxins in C. farreri, which lives as a filter
   feeder. Further analysis showed 15.43\% of the BAC sequence was
   repetitive. Tandem repeats were the most abundant repeat type, followed
   by transposable elements. A total of 31 SSRs were predicted in the four
   BACs. An IS10 family transposon was identified, and a suspected
   regulatory non-coding RNA gene for this transposon (RNA-OUT) was
   observed to overlap with it complementarily. This work will promote
   future studies on the genomics, immune system and non-coding regions of
   C. farreri. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Microcystis aeruginosa is reported to cause cyanobacterial blooms in
   shrimp breeding ponds, which can result in significant shrimp mortality.
   However, the toxic effects of M. aeruginosa on Litopenaeus vannamei are
   still not completely understood. In this paper, the toxicity of M.
   aeruginosa cells to L. vannamei was examined, and the toxic components
   in the cells were analyzed through high-pressure liquid chromatography
   (HLPC). In addition, the immune response of shrimp to the M. aeruginosa
   cell extract was assessed by measuring the activity of immune-related
   enzymes, as well as the transcription of the relevant genes. The results
   showed that M. aeruginosa cells, extract and cell-free cultured medium
   resulted in a 100\%, 98.3\%, and 1.7\% mortality rate in shrimp,
   respectively. HPLC analysis results revealed the presence of
   microcystin-LR (MC-LR) at a concentration of 190.40 mg/kg of cells. In
   addition, the activity and gene transcription of two immune related
   enzymes, SOD and LZM, were both significantly reduced in shrimp
   hepatopancreas (p < 0.05) after injection with extract. However, reduced
   glutathione (GSH) content was slightly increased, but the ratio of GSH
   to GSSG decreased. The transcription of gst gene function as
   detoxification, was significantly downregulated (p < 0.05). The results
   demonstrated that M. aeruginosa cell extract was highly toxic to L.
   vannamei, and exerted a negative effect on shrimp immunity including
   reduction of antioxidant capacity, antibacterial activity and
   detoxification activity, due to toxins including microcystin-LR.},

Title = {Proteomic analysis of anatoxin-a acute toxicity in zebrafish reveals
   gender specific responses and additional mechanisms of cell stress},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {93-101},

Abstract = {Anatoxin-a is a potent neurotoxin produced by several genera of
   cyanobacteria. Deaths of wild and domestic animals due to anatoxin-a
   exposure have been reported following a toxic response that is driven by
   the inhibition of the acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular
   junctions. The consequent neuron depolarization results in an
   overstimulation of the muscle cells. In order to unravel further
   molecular events implicated in the toxicity of anatoxin-a, a proteomic
   investigation was conducted. Applying two-dimensional gel
   electrophoresis (2DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we report early
   proteome changes in brain and muscle of zebrafish (Danio rerio) caused
   by acute exposure to anatoxin-a. In this regard, the test group of male
   and female zebrafish received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of an
   anatoxin-a dose of 0.8 mu g g(-1) of fish body weight (bw) in phosphate
   buffered saline solution (PBS), while the control received an i.p.
   injection of PBS only. Five minutes after i.p. injection, brain and
   muscle tissues were collected, processed and analyzed with 2DE.
   Qualitative and quantitative analyzes of protein abundance allowed the
   detection of differences in the proteome of control and exposed fish
   groups, and between male and female fish (gender specific responses).
   The altered proteins play functions in carbohydrate metabolism and
   energy production, ATP synthesis, cell structure maintenance, cellular
   transport, protein folding, stress response, detoxification and protease
   inhibition. These changes provide additional insights relative to the
   toxicity of anatoxin-a in fish. Taking into account the short time of
   response considered (5 min of response to the toxin), the changes in the
   proteome observed in this work are more likely to derive from fast
   occurring reactions in the cells. These could occur by protein activity
   regulation through degradation (proteolysis) and/or post-translational
   modifications, than from a differential regulation of gene expression,
   which may require more time for proteins to be synthesized and to
   produce changes at the proteomic level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Biosynthesis of the defensive compound pederin by females in the genus

   P. melanurus, which could be maintained in the laboratory for several
   generations, horizontal transmission occurs by ingestion of eggs
   inoculated with the specific endosymbionts. They are responsible for
   females' pederin polymorphism. Heating or freezing eliminated or
   markedly reduced transmission. This indicates bacteria that are unable
   to produce endospores and lacking a cell wall. Influences other than
   pederin biosynthesis could not be observed.},

   situ in artificial seawater) and the elt-coding gene (always detected).
   Emergence of viable but non-culturable bacteria appeared as an important
   stage in the pathogenic evolution of this strain; resuscitation
   experiments were attempted to confirm the expression of the elt-gene of
   virulence. This resuscitation was only possible during the first two or
   three days after stress when the bacteria are still virulent. More than
   three days after the stress, the bacteria were not able to recover their
   ability to grow again in rich medium, and consequently their virulence
   could not be proven. (C) 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Editions scientifiques et

Title = {In Vitro Toxicity Evaluation of Cyanotoxins Cylindrospermopsin and

Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by different types of
   cyanobacteria. Among them, Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and Microcystins
   (MCs) stand out due to their wide geographical distribution and toxicity
   in various organs, including the kidney, which is involved in their
   distribution and elimination. However, the renal toxicity caused by CYN
   and MCs has hardly been studied. The aim of this work was to assess the
   cytotoxicity effects caused by CYN and MC-LR in the renal cell line
   HEK293, and for the first time, the influence of CYN on the gene
   expression of selected genes in these cells by quantitative real-time
   PCR (qRT-PCR). CYN caused an upregulation in the gene expression after
   exposure to the highest concentration (5 mu g/mL) and the longest time
   of exposure (24 h). Moreover, shotgun proteomic analysis was used to
   assess the molecular responses of HEK293 cells after exposure to the
   individuals and combinations of CYN + MC-LR. The simultaneous exposure
   to both cyanotoxins caused a greater number of alterations in protein
   expression compared to single toxins, causing changes in the cellular,
   lipid and protein metabolism and in protein synthesis and transport.
   Further studies are needed to complete the toxicity molecular mechanisms
   of both CYN and MC-LR at the renal level.},

Title = {In vitro characterization of jellyfish venom fibrin(ogen) olytic enzymes
   from Nemopilema nomurai},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Background: Because jellyfish are capable of provoking envenomation in
   humans, they are considered hazardous organisms. Although the effects of
   their toxins are a matter of concern, information on the venom
   components, biological activity and pathological mechanisms are still
   scarce. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate a
   serine protease component of Nemopilema nomurai jellyfish venom (NnV)
   and unveil its characteristics.
   Methods: To determine the relationship between fibrinolytic activity of
   NnV and the serine protease, fibrin zymography was performed using
   metalloprotease and serine protease inhibitors. The biochemical
   characterization of serine proteases of NnV were determined by the
   amidolytic assay. Fractions with fibrinolytic activity were obtained by
   DEAE cation exchange column.
   Results: NnV displayed fibrinolytic activities with molecular masses of
   approximately 70, 35, 30, and 28 kDa. The fibrinolytic activity of NnV
   was completely obliterated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a prototype
   serine protease inhibitor. Based on amidolytic assays using chromogenic
   substrates specific for various kinds of serine proteases, NnV
   predominantly manifested a chymotrypsin-like feature. Its activity was
   completely eliminated at low pH (< 6) and high temperatures (> 37
   degrees C). Some metal ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ni2+) strongly
   suppressed its fibrinolytic activity, while others (Ca2+ and Mg2+)
   failed to do so. Isolation of a serine protease with fibrionolytic
   activity from NnV revealed that only p3 showed the fibrinolytic
   activity, which was completely inhibited by PMSF.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that N. nomurai jellyfish venom has
   a chymotrypsin-like serine protease with fibrinolytic activity. Such
   information might be useful for developing clinical management of
   jellyfish envenomation and pharmacological agents with therapeutic
   potential for thrombotic diseases in the future.},

Abstract = {We assessed the effectiveness of novel and cost-effective citrus fruit
   peel (oranges, agro-waste material) for the removal of four aflatoxins
   B-1, B-2, G(1), and G(2) in vitro. The biosorbent was described using
   SEM, XRF, XRD, FITR spectroscopy, and point of zero charge. The
   adsorption performance was optimised in a batch experiment by altering
   the various parameters, such as biosorbent dose (1-15 mg/mL), the
   preliminary concentration of AFs (20-200 ng/mL), pH (1-9), the
   incubation period (10-60 min), and temperature (10-45 degrees C).
   Maximum removal (90\%) was achieved when using biosorbent at 10 mg, each
   AF concentration 100 ng/mL, pH 3, and incubation time 45 min at 37
   degrees C. The experimental data were well-described by the Langmuir
   isotherm model and the monolayer coverage (Qe) was calculated to be
   78.5, 77.8, 79.2, and 75.6 ng/mg for aflatoxin B-1, B-2, G(1), and G(2),
   respectively. The thermodynamic and kinetic studies suggested that the
   adsorption performance was endothermic and obeyed the
   pseudo-second-order rate model. Studies at different pH also proved that
   the adsorption of toxins would be strong and sufficient under pH
   variation, as found in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus the biosorption
   of AFs by orange peel powder might be an efficient low price
   detoxification method in humans and animals.},

   transcription factors. The activation of the canonical AHR signaling
   pathway is known to induce the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes,
   facilitating the detoxification metabolism in the human body.
   Additionally, AHR could interact with various signaling pathways such as
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator
   of transcription 3 (STAT3), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1
   alpha), nuclear factor ekappa B (NF-kappa beta), estrogen receptor (ER),
   and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. Over the past 30 years,
   several studies have reported that various chemical, physical, or
   biological agents, such as tobacco, hydrocarbon compounds, industrial
   and agricultural chemical wastes, drugs, UV, viruses, and other toxins,
   could affect AHR expression or activity, promoting cancer development.
   Thus, it is valuable to overview how these factors regulate AHR-mediated
   carcinogenesis. Current findings have reported that many compounds could
   act as AHR ligands to drive the expressions of AHR-target genes, such as
   CYP1A1, CYP1B1, MMPs, and AXL, and other targets that exert a
   pro-proliferation or anti-apoptotic effect, like XIAP. Furthermore, some
   other physical and chemical agents, such as UV and 3-methylcholanthrene,
   could promote AHR signaling activities, increasing the signaling
   activities of a few oncogenic pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol
   3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein
   kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways.
   Understanding how various factors regulate AHR-mediated carcinogenesis
   processes helps clinicians and scientists plan personalized therapeutic
   strategies to improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy. As many studies
   that have reported the roles of AHR in regulating carcinogenesis are
   preclinical or observational clinical studies that did not explore the
   detailed mechanisms of how different chemical, physical, or biological
   agents promote AHR-mediated carcinogenesis processes, future studies
   should focus on conducting large-scale and functional studies to unravel
   the underlying mechanism of how AHR interacts with different factors in
   regulating carcinogenesis processes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to develop a method to purify large amounts of
   spirolide toxins from cultures of Alexandrium ostenfeldii. The
   dinoflagellates grew in batches under controlled conditions of salinity,
   light and temperature. Analysis of the cultures demonstrated the
   existence of neurotoxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning
   toxins and two spirolides, 13-desmethyl spirolide C and
   13,19-didesmethyl spirolide C. The protocol designed presents several
   stages of extraction, separation between spirolides and paralytic
   shellfish poisoning toxins, and cleanup in solid-phase extraction.
   Finally, the purification of spirolides was conducted by a preparative
   high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a mass
   spectrometer detector. The purity and the amount of both toxins in each
   step was monitored by analytical liquid chromatographic-mass
   spectrometry. Large amounts of 13-desMeC, 97\% pure, and 13,19-didesMeC,
   99\% pure, were obtained. A novel and efficient method to separate and
   purify spirolide toxins from large amounts of phytoplankton is provided.
   The protocol proposed shows, for the first time, a complete and detailed
   methodology to separate and purify spirolide toxins with high purity,
   recovery, repeatability and stability. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Title = {Restoration of alkaline soils contaminated by inorganic elements under
   pulsed electrokinetics},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {282},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Electrokinetics (EK) offers a viable approach for extracting inorganic
   toxins from alkaline soils. Nevertheless, the progression of acidic and,
   peculiarly, the alkaline front in soil diminishes contaminant
   elimination efficacy by the precipitation of metal ions as insoluble
   hydroxides. Moreover, the so-called focusing phenomenon (driven by the
   convergence of pH fronts) weakens electric field strength within the
   soil, thereby hindering ionic mobility and making ions removal further
   time-intensive, raising reclamation costs through increased labor and
   electrical energy consumption, etc. To address these shortcomings of
   continuous electric field, we have investigated the effect of pulsed
   field (30 min ON/OFF cycles of 1 Vcm-1) to slow down the production and
   propagation of pH fronts and thus delay the focusing development.
   Furthermore, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was introduced at
   the anode to optimize the elimination and alteration of Cr6+ into Cr3+
   ions by intense acidification. The findings indicate that pulsed fields
   have significantly enhanced the removal of ionic species by reducing the
   focusing localization and energy consumption. Additionally, EDTA
   effectively heightened the acidic environment, markedly improved the
   extraction of total Cr (74.4 \%), facilitating accelerated Cr6+
   reduction (89 \%) and persuading the unfamiliar electroendosmosis trend
   that augmented anion transport. In contrast, a continuous field
   intensified the redox reaction, exacerbating the focusing zone at 30 hr
   of treatment and inhibiting ion removal, increasing energy consumption
   by 12.24 \% relative to the pulsed strategy. In conclusion, pulsed field
   is a worthwhile alternative to the continuous approach, offering a
   controlled and energy-efficient process while minimizing anode
   deterioration and negative impacts on soil properties. Herein, it
   provides momentous insights for future field-scale applications,
   particularly in alkaline soils contaminated by heavy metals and salts,
   aiding the development of more cost-effective and environmentally
   sustainable soil remediation strategies.},

Abstract = {The rapidly dividing cleavage stages of embryos do not have the typical
   responses to cell damage, such as induction of the heat shock response,
   use of mitotic checkpoints, or use of apoptosis to eliminate severely
   damaged cells. This could create problems with integrity of DNA, but the
   solution in these embryos appears to be a ``be prepared{''} approach, in
   which specific adaptations are used to minimize DNA damage during
   cleavage and the use of apoptosis at the mid-blastula transition to
   remove any cells that were nevertheless damaged. It has been assumed
   that this approach has evolved because of the advantage of rapid
   production of a motile larvae. Alternatively, this particular approach
   may have the selective advantage of increasing mutation rate when there
   are greater environmental stresses. This could provide more variants on
   which selective pressures could act and thus accelerate evolution during
   environmentally stressful periods.},

Volume = {29},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The persistence of malachite green (MG), and its metabolite
   leucomalachite green (LMG), in fish tissues is still unclear, leading to
   many trade disputes. In this research, we established and evaluated an
   HPLC method that could detect MG and LMG simultaneously, and then
   investigated the persistence of these two toxins in the tissues of
   juvenile perch (Lateolabrax japonicus) post sub-chronic MG exposure at
   1.0 mg/L. Exposure lasted for 2 h everyday and was repeated six times.
   The perch were then placed in MG-free seawater for 100 d to eliminate
   the toxins. Results show that MG accumulated in the tissues, including
   the gills, liver, muscle, blood and viscera, and then was metabolized
   rapidly to LMG. The concentrations of these two toxins increased
   significantly with the accumulation process. In general, the highest
   concentrations of MG and LMG in all tissue exceeded 1 000 mu g/kg,
   except for MG in the muscle. The order of accumulation levels (highest
   to lowest) of MG was gill>blood>liver>viscera>muscle, while that of LMG
   was liver>blood>gill>viscera>muscle. High levels of MG or LMG could
   persist for several hours but decreased rapidly during the elimination
   process. The concentration of LMG was much higher than that of MG during
   the experiment, especially in the gill, liver and blood. Therefore, the
   three tissues play important roles in toxin accumulation,
   biotransformation, and elimination. Although the MG and LMG
   concentrations in muscle were much lower than in other tissues, the
   content still exceeded the European minimum required performance limit
   (MRPL), even after 2 400 h (100 d) of elimination. This demonstrates
   that it is extremely difficult to eliminate MG and LMG from tissues of
   perch, and therefore use of these toxins is of concern to public health.},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {795-801},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxicity of barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) head, viscera and flesh
   tissues has been determined in 219 specimens caught along the southwest
   coast of Puerto Rico from March 1985 through May 1987. Twenty-nine
   percent of these specimens were toxic. Monthly frequencies of ciguatoxic
   barracuda showed an apparent seasonal variability, with peak values
   (60-70\% toxic fish) in the late winter-early spring (January-May) and
   fall (August-November). Minimal frequencies (0-10\% toxic fish) were
   observed during June-July and December. The most frequently toxic
   tissues in poisonous animals were the viscera and head. Viscera tissue
   was the only toxic tissue found in 31\% of the poisonous fish assayed,
   and this tissue was poisonous in all toxic fish. In no case was a
   poisonous specimen found to have toxic flesh alone. Marked temporal
   variation in frequency of ciguatoxicity suggests that ciguatera toxins,
   at least in their active form, are not accumulated in barracuda tissues
   for extended  periods of time. Variability in barracuda ciguatoxicity
   may reflect fluctuations in the toxicity of smaller reef fish prey,
   seasonal fluctuations in toxic benthic dinoflagellates and/or changes in
   the ability of the barracuda to detoxify ingested poisons or their
   precursors.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been proposed as an agent to mitigate toxic
   cyanobacterial blooms due to the heightened sensitivity of cyanobacteria
   to reactive oxygen species relative to eukaryotic organisms. Here,
   experiments were conducted using water from four diverse, eutrophic lake
   ecosystems to study the effects of H(2)O(2)on cyanobacteria and
   non-target members of the microbial community. H(2)O(2)was administered
   at 4 mu g L(-1)and a combination of fluorometry, microscopy, flow
   cytometry, and high throughput DNA sequencing were used to quantify the
   effects on eukaryotic and prokaryotic plankton communities. The addition
   of H(2)O(2)resulted in a significant reduction in cyanobacteria levels
   in nearly all experiments (10 of 11), reducing their relative abundance
   from, on average, 85\% to 29\% of the total phytoplankton community
   withPlanktothrixbeing highly sensitive,Microcystisbeing moderately
   sensitive, andCylindrospermopsisbeing most resistant. Concurrently,
   eukaryotic algal levels increased in 75\% of experiments. The bacterial
   phylaActinobacteria, cyanobacteria,Planctomycetes,
   andVerrucomicrobiawere most negatively impacted by H2O2,
   withActinobacteriabeing the most sensitive. The ability of H(2)O(2)to
   reduce, but not fully eliminate, cyanobacteria from the eutrophic water
   bodies studied here suggests it may not be an ideal mitigation approach
   in high biomass ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Millepora complanata is a cnidarian widely distributed in the coral
   reefs of the Mexican Caribbean. This species is popularly known as
   ``fire coral{''}, since contact with it causes severe pain, skin
   eruptions and blisters. Intravenous administration of of M. complanata
   aqueous extract induces violent convulsions and death in mice within 1
   min (LD50 = 4.62 mu g protein/g of body weight). Doses less than the
   LD50 produced histopathological damage in kidneys and lungs. Such
   histopathological damage was completely eliminated after incubation of
   the extract in heat denaturing conditions. Unexpectedly, the denatured
   extract conserved its lethal effect. These findings demonstrated that
   the extract contained hemolytic and phospholipase activities that might
   be responsible for the histopathological damage, and additionally it
   contained other unidentified thermostable toxins with lethal effects in
   mice. Chromatographic analysis of the extract led to the isolation of a
   61 kDa vasoconstrictor protein. Furthermore, several non-peptidic
   vasoconstrictor fractions were separated. Particularly interesting was
   the fraction MCI-IIA obtained as a result of three-step chromatography
   processes (ion exchange, gel filtration and reverse phase). Like the
   original crude extract, this fraction induced vasoconstriction and
   delayed hemolysis and lethal effects in mice. A subsequent
   chromatographic analysis of MCI-IIA showed that this fraction contained
   at least four non-peptidic compounds. MS and NMR spectroscopic data
   analyses indicated that these metabolites were poly-oxygenated
   alkylbenzenes. The present study constitutes the first report of the
   presence of non-peptidic lethal toxins in an organism of the class
   Hydrozoa, and evidences the great structural diversity of the toxins
   produced by the Millepora species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {In 2009, we achieve the first inhibition FP assay to detect imine cyclic
   toxins. In the present paper we propose a new FP assay for direct
   quantify spirolides. This new method has resulted in significant
   improvement of sensitivity, rapidity and accessibility. In the method
   design, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata
   membranes labelled with a derivative of fluorescein was used.
   Spirolides, 13-desmethyl spirolide C (13-desMeC) and 13,19-didesmethyl
   spirolide C (13,19-didesMeC) were extracted and purified from cultures
   of the Alexandrium ostenfeldii dinoflagellate. Data showed the decrease
   of FP when toxin concentration was increased. Thus, a relationship
   between the FP units and the spirolides amount present in a sample was
   obtained. This direct assay is a reproducible, simple and very sensitive
   method with a detection limit about 25 nM for 13-desMeC and 150 nM for
   13,19-didesMeC. The procedure was used to measure spirolides in mussel
   samples using an extraction and clean up protocol suitable for the FP
   assay. Results obtained show that this method is able to quantify
   13-desMeC in the range of 50-350 mu g kg(-1) meat. Other liposoluble
   toxins did not interfere with the assay, proving a specific method.
   Moreover, the matrix do not affect in the range of toxin concentrations
   that involving risk of spirolides intoxication. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Textile and dye industries have discharged various kinds of toxic
   residual dyes particularly azo dyes into the environment. In addition to
   its resistance to biological degradation, Direct Red 23 (DR-23) azo dye
   is considered toxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic to the
   ecosystem. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of
   different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for DR-23 dye
   detoxification. Single and combined patterns of AOPs, namely ozonation
   (O-3), O-3/ultraviolet (UV), O-3/UV/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and
   O-3/ultrasonic (US), were applied. The effect of pH (3-11) and initial
   dye concentration (100-500 mg/L), with implication of UV, H2O2, and US,
   on dye removal efficiency were studied. Decolorization efficiency was
   found considerably depends on the initial dye concentration and the pH
   of the solution. The maximum decolorization was obtained at pH 9. The
   color removal efficiency reached 100\% for 100 mg/L DR-23 dye at 15 min
   using both O(3)and O-3/UV processes. The half-life of O-3, O-3/UV,
   O-3/UV/H2O2, and O-3/US were found to be 12.4, 9.0, 15.8, and 10.5 min,
   respectively. The kinetic of AOPs for DR-23 dye removal followed the
   pseudo-first-order. For example, the rate constant (k(obs)) of 400 mg/L
   dye increased to about 38\% using O-3/UV as compared to O(3)alone.
   Furthermore, LC-(ESI)-MS/MS analysis of the treated DR-23 dye solution
   was performed to study the final degradation products. It was shown that
   a DR-23 dye radical underwent partial and complete decomposition of the
   dye ring to form final products, namely oxalic acid and formic acid.},

Title = {Feeding Intensity of females and males of the veined rapa whelk
   Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846) (Gastropoda, Muricidae) in the
   Black Sea},
Journal = {VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA},

Pages = {134-150},
Abstract = {The veined rapa whelk Rapana venosa, a predatory gastropod living in a
   wide range of salinities from 15 to 32\% is indigenous to the coastal
   waters of China, Korea and Japan and is an invasive species in the Black
   Sea. This invasion has led to structural alterations in bivalve
   communities, which have changed the species dominance and ratio (Ivanov,
   1961; Chukhchin, 1984; Zolotarev, Terentyev, 2012; Skolka, Preda, 2010),
   and was one of the reasons for the stocks of commercial bivalves -
   mussels and oysters - to decrease (Chukhchin, 1984; Ivanov, 1968;
   Chukhchin 1961b; Snigirov et al., 2013). R. venosa feeds on bivalves,
   and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is its main food.
   The purpose of this work was to determine the rations of females and
   males of the gastropod R. venosa throughout the year as a function of
   the sea water temperature.
   The animals with the shell height of approximate to 60 mm and total
   weight of approximate to 50 g collected in March 2020 at a depth of 9-12
   m under a mussel-and-oyster farm (outer roadstead of the Sevastopol Bay,
   44 degrees 37'13.4{''}N; 33 degrees 30'13.6{''}E) were kept in a plastic
   cage at a depth of 2.5 m. The cage was divided into two compartments
   (for females and males) sheathed with a plastic mesh on top. The sex
   determination carried out at the beginning of the experiment, when
   observing the rapa whelk copulation, was confirmed at the end of the
   experiment by examining gonadal smears under a microscope (See Fig. 1,
   Fig. 5).
   The mollusks were amply fed, and the food, which was live mussels grown
   on the mussel-and-oyster farm, was replenished as needed. To determine
   the daily rations of R. venosa, correlations between the weight of soft
   tissues of mussels and the shell length were found in the form of the
   power-law equations (See Table 1).
   In the experiment, R. venosa individuals applied several methods of
   attacking mussels: smothering by pressing the valves with the foot,
   periodically weakening the pressing force until the valves opened;
   excreting a biotoxin near the prey, causing paralysis of the mussel
   adductor muscle; pressing a mussel with the foot to the edge of their
   shells, breaking off a piece of the mussel valve and violating the
   mussel shell integrity. The proportion of the damaged mussel shells was
   about 17\% over the study period. The rest of the mussel shells were
   opened without damage to the shell. Whatever the attack method was
   performed, the gastropod ate out mussel's soft tissues after the mussel
   slightly opened its valves.
   During the study period, the daily rations of females and males varied,
   respectively, in the ranges 0-1.0390 and 0-0.9012 g.ind.(-1).day(-1)
   (See Fig. 2). Breaks in the food intake were noted in winter, from 7 to
   14 days for females, and from 14 to 30 days for males. The feeding
   intensity rose with the increase of water temperature and reached its
   highest in the late June till mid-August at a temperature of 23.5-26.8
   degrees C. The maximum feeding intensity of females was noted during the
   laying of egg capsules, from June to August. The food intake was uneven,
   being related to the feeding rhythms. The feeding intensities of R.
   venosa females (See Fig. 3) and males (See Fig. 4) were fitted with
   third-order polynomials as a function of water temperature in the sea.
   The mean values of the linear or weight characteristics of females and
   males at the beginning and end of the experiment did not differ
   significantly. It was established that the average daily rations of
   females are significantly higher than those of males. The calculated
   average daily ration of females with a shell height of 63.9 mm and a
   total weight of 45.97 g was 0.3784 g.ind.(-1).day(-1), or 0.82\% of
   their total weight. For males with a shell height of 61.2 mm and a total
   weight of 47.1 g, the calculated average daily ration was 0.2750
   g.ind.(-1).day(-1), or 0.67\% of the total weight.
   One R. venosa female consumed 100.28 g of mussel soft tissues per year,
   or 45 commercial-size mussels (L = 50 mm; mean soft tissue weight = 2.21
   g), which is 2.0 times the total weight of the gastropod female. One R.
   venosa male consumed 72.88 g of soft tissues of mussels (or about 33
   specimens) per year, which is 1.5 times its total weight.
   The data obtained are necessary to study the population structure of R.
   venosa and assess the impact of this predatory gastropod on the local
   populations of the mussel M. galloprovincialis in the Black Sea. The
   analysis of the feeding intensity data shows that ecological damage from
   the predator will be noticeable for a mussel population with the density
   of 500 g.m(-2) (or 50 ind..m(-2); mean shell length = 50 mm) if the rapa
   whelk density in this area is 25 g.m(-2). The mussel biomass will then
   have decreased by 50\% over the year. The mussel settlement density can
   be restored within 2-3 years. It is known that the largest number of
   larvae enters the pelagial from the mussel biocenosis because M.
   galloprovincialis has very high fecundity and its spawning periods are
   extended in time (Kiseleva, 1981). The soft-bottom (silty) habitat of
   this mussel is limited by the depth range from 30-40 m to 50-60 m and
   its rocky shore habitat extends to a depth of 30 m (Zaika, 1998). R.
   venosa inhabits mainly sandy-shell and shelly seabeds to a depth of
   26-30 m (Chukhchin, 1984; Bondarev, 2016; Danilov et al., 2018).
   Consequently, the range of the mussel M. galloprovincialis only
   partially overlaps with the range of R. venosa in contrast to the range
   of the oyster Ostrea edulis which exhibits full overlap with that of the
   rapa whelk (Chukhchin, 1961b). Mussel farms in the Black Sea are also an
   important source of larvae. In the last decade, the annual production of
   mussels in Russia amounted to about 200 tons (Kholodov et al., 2017). On
   farm collectors, mussels grow to a commercial size within 1.5-2 years.
   During this period, they can spawn 3-4 times since they become sexually
   mature in the first year of life. Hence, the experimental results on the
   feeding intensity of R. venosa and the analysis of the benthos state
   monitoring results do not confirm the hypothesis about ecological threat
   to the population of mussels in the Black Sea.},

Abstract = {2. We found that relative growth rates and rates of survival were higher
   when they fed on mixed diets compared to lupine only. These results were
   consistent with hypotheses that mixed diets provided balanced nutrition,
   diluted toxins, and/or allowed recovery from parasitoids, although our
   data did not allow us to separate these non-exclusive explanations.
   3. We assayed alkaloids in their host foliage, in the caterpillars
   themselves, in parasitoids within caterpillars, in food boluses passing
   through their guts, and in frass that they excreted. We consistently
   found positive assays for alkaloids in foliage and in frass but negative
   assays in caterpillars, parasitoids, and food boluses. This suggests
   that the alkaloids that they ingest are metabolised or rendered
   non-reactive by unknown means during passage through the gut. We found
   no support for the hypothesis that mixed diets prevented caterpillars
   from exhausting food supplies or allowed them to sequester chemicals
   from their alkaloid-containing hosts.
   4. Behavioural observations revealed that previous experience influenced
   a caterpillar's likelihood of moving to a different host. Caterpillars
   that had previously fed on other hosts were more likely to move to
   lupine while caterpillars previously collected on lupine were equally
   likely to choose more lupine or a different host.
   5. These results are unusual in providing a clear and consistent benefit
   of diet mixing in a natural field setting where multiple ecological
   factors act upon the caterpillars.},

Abstract = {In 45\% of crab carapaces examined after octopus feeding, the surface of
   an eye was found to have been punctured. Experiments in which green
   crabs (Carcinus maenas L.) were retrieved from feeding octopuses
   (Eledone cirrhosa Lamarck) showed that this penetration of the eye
   occurred less than ten min after capture. These findings are consistent
   with direct observations and visualization by ultrasound showing that
   initially after capture the anterior of the crab is often held to the
   mouth of the octopus. In vitro injection of octopus saliva into crabs
   demonstrated that eye puncture is the most rapid and completely
   effective route of entry for cephalopod toxins. Comparative feeding
   experiments using swimming crabs (Liocarcinus depurator L. and Necora
   puber L.) showed incidences of eye puncture of up to 75\%. These
   observations provide a new explanation for the means by which the crabs
   are immobilized so rapidly during octopus predation.},

Title = {p-Cresyl Sulfate Promotes Insulin Resistance Associated with CKD},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the insulin resistance that frequently
   accompanies CKD are poorly understood, but the retention of renally
   excreted compounds may play a role. One such compound is p-cresyl
   sulfate (PCS), a protein-bound uremic toxin that originates from
   tyrosine metabolism by intestinal microbes. Here, we sought to determine
   whether PCS contributes to CKD-associated insulin resistance.
   Administering PCS to mice with normal kidney function for 4 weeks
   triggered insulin resistance, loss of fat mass, and ectopic
   redistribution of lipid in muscle and liver, mimicking features
   associated with CKD. Mice treated with PCS exhibited altered insulin
   signaling in skeletal muscle through ERK1/2 activation. In addition,
   exposing C2C12 myotubes to concentrations of PCS observed in CKD caused
   insulin resistance through direct activation of ERK1/2. Subtotal
   nephrectomy led to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in mice, and
   treatment with the prebiotic arabino-xylo-oligosaccharide, which reduced
   serum PCS by decreasing intestinal production of p-cresol, prevented
   these metabolic derangements. Taken together, these data suggest that
   PCS contributes to insulin resistance and that targeting PCS may be a
   therapeutic strategy in CKD. J Am Soc Nephrol 24: 88-99, 2013. doi:

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Musculista senhousia (Benson in Cantor, 1842) is a small thin-shelled
   mytilid inhabiting intertidal and shallow subtidal sediments. Prior to
   2000, M. senhousia was widespread in the Swan River estuary, Perth,
   Western Australia. In 2000 the Perth region experienced its largest
   recorded summer rainfall event, with over 270 GL entering the estuary.
   The rainfall formed a freshwater lens over much of the river and a
   subsequent toxic algal bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis
   aeruginosa. M. aeruginosa produces a toxin microcystin, known to have
   adverse effects upon molluscs. Surveys to assess the status of M.
   senhousia in the estuary in 2007 failed to find any individuals. We
   suggest the apparent death of M. senhousia from the estuary may be
   attributable to a combination of high seasonal variability in the
   mussel's populations, high summer rainfall reducing salinity, and a
   toxic algal bloom that eliminated any remaining M. senhousia
   individuals.},

Abstract = {Recently, eutrophication has induced severe cyanobacterial blooms in the
   Naktong River, the second largest river of Korea. In the present study,
   lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase,
   catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, were evaluated in the liver of
   loach (Misgurnus mizolepis) that were orally exposed to a low dose of
   Microcystis through dietary supplementation with bloom scum. Loach
   received 75 mg of dry cells/kg body weight (equal to 10 mu g
   microcystin-RR/kg body mass), for 28 days under controlled conditions.
   Antioxidant enzymatic activity and lipid peroxidation were measured
   after termination of exposure. The activities of antioxidant enzyme were
   significantly increased in the livers of toxin-exposed loach after 28
   days of exposure, as compared to control fish. However, lipid
   peroxidation remained stable in both groups. These results suggest that
   antioxidant enzymes were able to eliminate oxidative stress induced by
   low concentrations of microcystins and to prevent increased lipid
   peroxidation in the liver of loach. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {In the current study we present the first report on the bioaccumulation
   of microcystins (MC) in zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha from the
   eutrophic brackish water Curonian Lagoon. The bioaccumulation capacity
   was related to age structure of mussels and ambient environmental
   conditions. We also discuss the relevant implications of these findings
   for biomonitoring of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Curonian Lagoon
   and potential consequences for D. polymorpha cultivation activities
   considered for the futures as remediation measure. Samples for the
   analysis were collected twice per year, in June and September, in 2006,
   2007 and 2008, from two sites within the littoral zone of the lagoon.
   The highest microcystin concentrations were measured in mussels larger
   than 30 mm length and sampled in 2006 (when a severe toxic cyanobacteria
   bloom occurred). In the following years, a consistent reduction in
   bioaccumutated MC concentration was noticed. However, certain amount of
   microcystin was recorded in mussel tissues in 2007 and 2008, when no
   cyanotoxins were reported in the phytoplankton. Considering high
   depuration rates and presence of cyanotoxins in the bottom sediments
   well after the recorded toxic blooms, we assume mechanism of secondary
   contamination when microcystin residuals could be uptaken by mussels
   with resuspended sediment particles. (C) 2014 Institute of Oceanology of

Title = {Adsorption of emerging pollutants utilizing chitosan derivatives: Recent
   advances and future perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {299},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Globalization resulted in technological advancement, and urban
   population growth. Consequently, pollution emerged as an imminent risk
   to the survival of all species on Earth. Consequently, on a worldwide
   basis, sustainability become a major issue for legislators. Inconsistent
   impacts on both human and animal growth and wellness triggered health
   issues associated with water contamination through the chronic
   toxicants. Micropollutants' pollution prompted severe concerns due to
   their malignant, indestructible, and accumulative properties. The
   elimination of these toxins from industrial processes has become one of
   the most significant ecological challenges. A variety of both organic
   and simulated sorbents are available, and each of these have unique
   benefits. In the recent years, chitosan and its composite materials have
   been attempted and have been proven to be applicable for the resolution
   of many challenging issues related to water pollution. Among various
   notable benefits of adsorption processes, economic viability, ease of
   access, and adherence to environmental regulations are notable.
   Considering the above-mentioned issues, the article targets the
   assessment of chitosan and its composite materials for relevant
   environmental applications. Accordingly, the article aims to examine the
   performance, advantages, and disadvantages of chitosan as an adsorbent.},

Title = {Control effects of different herbicides on Spartina alterniflora},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As an invasive species, Spartina alterniflora has caused serious harm to
   many coastal wetland ecosystems, and its prevention and control have
   become the top priority of coastal wetland protection. To explore the
   difference in the control effects of different herbicides on S.
   alterniflora and optimize the chemical control technology, four
   experiments were carried out in this study, namely, different
   herbicides, different doses, different dilution ratios, and mowing +
   herbicide. The results showed that (1) 75 days after the application of
   herbicide, the control effects of high doses of glyphosate (8.0 kg
   ha(-1)), cyhalofop-butyl (0.8 kg ha(-1)) or imazameth (0.4 kg ha(-1))
   were only 25\%-38\%, and the control effects of lower doses were worse;
   (2) Haloxyfop-R-methyl could permanently kill S. alterniflora. Applying
   0.30 kg ha(-1 )and 0.45 kg ha(-1) of haloxyfop-R-methyl in June, the
   control efficacy was >95\% in the first year and 84\%-99\% in the third
   year. In addition, there was no significant difference in weed control
   effect when the same dose of Haloxyfop-R-methyl was sprayed twice on
   June 8 and July 28 or once on June 8; (3) The mixed application of two
   of the four herbicides, namely, glyphosate, cyhalofop-butyl, imazameth
   and Haloxyfop-R-methyl, did not improve the control effect on S.
   alterniflora; (4) When the herbicide stock solution was diluted 58-461
   times with water, Haloxyfop-R-methyl had a very good control effect on
   S. alterniflora; (5) Spraying Haloxyfop-R-methyl immediately after
   mowing could not effectively control S. alterniflora, and the
   regeneration of S. alterniflora was serious in the second year; and (6)
   Compared with the S. alterniflora area without herbicide application,
   there was no significant change in the species and quantity of
   macrobenthos one month after herbicide application. However, in the
   third year after herbicide application, S. alterniflora near the study
   area failed to invade the area where the herbicide was applied,
   indicating that residual toxins were likely to remain in the soil. In
   summary, haloxyfop-R-methyl can effectively control S. alterniflora, and
   haloxyfop-R-methyl application can be used as an optional method to
   eliminate newly invaded small areas of S. alterniflora, but it is not
   recommended to use herbicides in large areas. In the future, it is
   necessary to strengthen the monitoring of herbicide residues in soil and
   water and comprehensively assess the impact of herbicides on the
   environment and organisms to provide sufficient technical support for
   the use of herbicides to control S. alterniflora.},

Title = {Feeding characteristics of an amoeba (Lobosea: Naegleria)
   grazing upon cyanobacteria:: Food selection, ingestion and digestion
   progress},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {51},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Bacterivory by heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates has been
   widely studied in aquatic environments, but data on the grazing of
   amoebae, are still scarce. From the water samples of Dianchi Lake
   (Kunming, Yunnan Province, China), we isolated an amoeba, designated as
   Naegleria sp. strain W2, which had potent grazing effects on some kind
   of cyanobacteria. The food selection mechanism and the digestion process
   of the amoeba were investigated in batch experiments. Predation
   experiments showed that filamentous cyanobacteria (e.g., Anabaena,
   Cylindrospermum, Gloeotrichia, and Phormidium) were readily consumed,
   with clearance rates ranging from 0.332 to 0.513 nL amoeba(-1) h(-1).
   The tight threads (Oscilltoria) and aggregates (Aphanizomenon) could not
   be ingested; however, their sonicated fragments were observed inside
   food vacuoles, suggesting that their morphologies prevent them from
   being ingested. Live video microscopy noted that unicellular
   Chroococcaceae (e.g., Synechococcus, Aphanocapsa, and Microcystis) were
   excreted after ingestion, indicating that food selection takes place
   inside food vacuoles. To determine whether the tastes or the toxins
   prevented them from being digested, heat-killed cells were retested for
   predation. Digestion rates and ingestion rates of the amoebae for
   filamentous cyanobacteria were estimated from food vacuole content
   volume. Through a ``cold-chase{''} method, we found that the food
   vacuole contents declined exponentially in diluted amoebae cells, and
   digestion rates were relatively constant, averaging about 1.5\% food
   vacuole content min(-1) at 28 degrees C. Ingestion strongly depended on
   the satiation status of the amoebae, starved amoebae fed at higher rates
   compared with satiated amoebae. Our results suggest that the food
   selection and food processing mechanisms of the amoeba are similar to
   those of interception feeding flagellates; however, filamentous
   cyanobacteria cannot obtain a refuge under the grazing pressure of
   phagotrophic amoebae, which may widen our knowledge on the grazing of
   protists.},

Title = {Cyanobacteria and prawn fanning in northern New South Wales, Australia
   -: a case study on cyanobacteria diversity and hepatotoxin
   bioaccumulation},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {203},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-256},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Harmful cyanobacteria pose a hazard to aquatic ecosystems due to toxins
   (hepatotoxic microcystins, nodularins, and cylindrospermopsin) they
   produce. The microcystins and nodularins are potent toxins, which are
   also tumor promoters. The microcystins and nodularins may accumulate
   into aquatic organisms and be transferred to higher trophic levels, and
   eventually affect vector animals and consumers. Prawn farming is a
   rapidly growing industry in Australia. Because information regarding
   effects of cyanobacteria at prawn farms was lacking, we examined
   diversity of cyanobacteria and toxin production plus bioaccumulation
   into black tiger prawns (Penaeus monodon) under both field (northern New
   South Wales, Australia, December 2001-April 2002) and laboratory
   conditions. Samples were analyzed for hepatotoxins using enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC).
   The maximum density of cyanobacteria (1 x 10(6) to 4 x 10(6) cells/l)
   was reached in April. Cyanobacteria, encountered were Oscillatoria sp.
   (up to 4 x 10(6) cells/l), Pseudanabaena sp. (up to 1.8 x 10(6)
   cells/l), Microcystis sp. (up to 3.5 x 10(4) cells/l), and Aphanocapsa
   sp. (up to 2 x 10(4) cells/l). An uncommon cyanobacterium, Romeria sp.
   (LIP to 2.2 x 10(6) cells/l), was also observed. Contrasting earlier
   indications, toxic Nodularia spumigena was absent. Despite that both
   Oscillatoria sp. and Microcystis sp. are potentially hepatotoxic,
   hepatotoxin levels in phytoplankton samples remained low (up to 0.5-1.2
   mg/kg dw; ELISA) in 2001-2002. ELISA was found suitable not only for
   phytoplankton but prawn tissues as well. Enzymatic pretreatment improved
   extractability of hepatotoxin from cyanobacteria (nodularin from N.
   spumigena as an example), but did not generally increase toxin recovery
   from prawn hepatopancreas.
   There were slightly increasing hepatotoxin concentrations in prawn
   hepatopancreas (front 6-20 to 20-80 mu g/kg dw; ELISA) during the study.
   Hepatotoxin concentrations in surface sediment remained low (< 5 mu g/kg
   dw; ELISA) throughout the study. Laboratory experiments indicated that
   prawn hepatopancreas, heart, and brain were primary organs for
   hepatotoxin bioaccumulation. Toxin concentration in other organs,
   including muscle, was less effective. Orally administered nodularin
   levels in hepatopancreas rapidly decreased from initial 830 to 250 mu
   g/kg dw in 96 h. Similarly, concentration of microcystin-LR injected in
   prawns decreased from 130 to 30 mu g/kg dw (hepatopancreas) in 2 h.
   These results demonstrate that potential risks caused by cyanobacteria
   in prawn farming (farmers, prawns, and consumers) were not Substantial
   in 2001-2002. Although prawns may act as vectors for toxin transfer,
   they did not accumulate alerting amounts of hepatotoxins and were able
   to effectively detoxify them. Because bloom toxicity may vary,
   low-frequency toxin monitoring is recommended. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Two types of blast furnace slag (BFS), granulated (GS) and air-cooled
   slag (ACS), were evaluated as basal media for eelgrass bed. Evaluation
   was done by comparing BFS samples with natural eelgrass sediment (NES)
   in terms of some physico-chemical characteristics and then,
   investigating growth of eelgrass both in BFS and NES. In terms of
   particle size, both BFS samples were within the range acceptable for
   growing eelgrass. However. compared with NES, low silt-clay content for
   ACS and lack of organic matter content for both BFS samples were found.
   Growth experiment showed that eelgrass can grow in both types of BFS,
   although growth rates in BFS samples shown by leaf elongation were
   slower than that in NES. The possible reasons for stunted growth in BFS
   were assumed to be lack of organic matter and release of some possible
   toxins from BFS. Reduction of sulfide content of BFS samples did not
   result to enhanced growth; though sulfide release was eliminated,
   release of Zn was greater than before treatment and concentration of
   that reached to alarming amounts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Monitoring water supply requires, among other quality indicators, the
   identification of the cyanobacteria community and taking into account
   their potential impact in terms of water quality. In this work,
   cyanobacteria strains were isolated from the Cheffia Reservoir and
   identified based on morphological features, the 16S rRNA gene,
   phylogenetic analysis, and toxin production by polymerase chain reaction
   PCR screening of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of cyanotoxins
   (mcyA, mcyE, sxtA, sxtG, sxtI, cyrJ, and anaC). Thirteen strains
   representing six different genera: Aphanothece, Microcystis,
   Geitlerinema, Lyngbya, Microcoleus, and Pseudanabaena were obtained. The
   results demonstrated the importance of morphological features in
   determining the genus or the species when incongruence between the
   morphological and phylogenetic analysis occurs and only the utility of
   the 16S rRNA gene in determining higher taxonomic levels. The
   phylogenetic analysis confirmed the polyphyly of cyanobacteria for the
   Microcystis and Oscillatoriales genera. Unexpectedly, Aphanothece sp. CR
   11 had the genetic potential to produce microcystins. Our study gives
   new insight into species with picoplanktonic (or small) cell size and
   potentially toxic genotypes in this ecosystem. Thus, conventional water
   treatment methods in this ecosystem have to be adapted, indicating the
   requirement for pre-treatment methods that can effectively eliminate
   picocyanobacteria while preserving cell integrity to prevent toxin
   release.},

Abstract = {Palytoxin is one of the most complex and biggest molecules known to show
   extreme acute toxicity. The dinoflagellate Ostreopsis spp., the producer
   organism of palytoxin, has been shown to be distributed worldwide, thus
   making palytoxin an emerging toxin. Rat-derived hepatocytes (Clone 9)
   and BE (2)-M17 human neuroblastoma cells were used to test palytoxin or
   palytoxin-like compounds by measuring the cell metabolic rate with
   Alamar Blue. The dose-dependent decrease in viability was specifically
   inhibited by ouabain in the case of BE (2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells. This
   is a functional, dynamic and simple test for palytoxins with high
   sensitivity (as low as 0.2 ng/ml). This method was useful for toxin
   detection in Ostreopsis extracts and naturally contaminated mussel
   samples. A comparative study testing toxic mussel extracts by LC (liquid
   chromatography)-MS/MS (tandem MS), MBA (mouse bioassay), haemolysis
   neutralization assay and a cytotoxicity test indicated that our method
   is suitable for the routine determination and monitoring of palytoxins
   and palytoxin-like compounds.},

Abstract = {Vibrio cholerae causes the life-threatening diarrheal disease cholera.
   This organism persists in aquatic environments in areas of endemicity,
   and it is believed that the ability of the bacteria to form biofilms in
   the environment contributes to their persistence. Expression of an
   exopolysaccharide (EPS), encoded by two vps gene clusters, is essential
   for biofilm formation and causes a rugose colonial phenotype. We
   previously reported that the lack of a flagellum induces V. cholerae EPS
   expression. To uncover the signaling pathway that links the lack of a
   flagellum to EPS expression, we introduced into a rugose flaA strain
   second-site mutations that would cause reversion back to the smooth
   phenotype. Interestingly, mutation of the genes encoding the
   sodium-driven motor (mot) in a nonflagellated strain reduces EPS
   expression, biofilm formation, and vps gene transcription, as does the
   addition of phenamil, which specifically inhibits the sodium-driven
   motor. Mutation of vpsR, which encodes a response regulator, also
   reduces EPS expression, biofilm formation, and vps gene transcription in
   nonflagellated cells. Complementation of a vpsR strain with a
   constitutive vpsR allele likely to mimic the phosphorylated state (D59E)
   restores EPS expression and biofilm formation, while complementation
   with an allele predicted to remain unphosphorylated (D59A) does not. Our
   results demonstrate the involvement of the sodium-driven motor and
   suggest the involvement of phospho-VpsR in the signaling cascade that
   induces EPS expression. A nonflagellated strain expressing EPS is
   defective for intestinal colonization in the suckling mouse model of
   cholera and expresses reduced amounts of cholera toxin and
   toxin-coregulated pili in vitro. Wild-type levels of virulence factor
   expression and colonization could be restored by a second mutation
   within the vps gene cluster that eliminated EPS biosynthesis. These
   results demonstrate a complex relationship between the
   flagellum-dependent EPS signaling cascade and virulence.},

   non-lethal heat shock},

Abstract = {Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) caused by Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus carrying toxin producing plasmid, has led to severe
   mortalities in farmed penaeid shrimp throughout Asia. Previous studies
   reported that a non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) could enhance disease
   tolerance in aquatic animals. Here, we investigate whether the NLHS
   could enhance the survival of shrimp Penaeusvannamei upon challenge with
   an AHPND-causing strain of V. Parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Two NLHS
   conditions, acute and chronic NLHSs, were used. The former abruptly
   exposed the juveniles shrimp from 28 degrees C to 38 degrees C for 30
   min only once whereas the latter exposed the shrimp to 38 degrees C for
   5 min every day for 7 days. The treated shrimp were, then, challenged
   with VPAHPND at day 3, day 7, and day 30 during the recovery time after
   the treatment. The results showed that the shrimp exposed to either
   acute or chronic NLHS had higher survival rate (>50\%) than that of the
   non-heated shrimp control (20\%) when they were challenged with VPAHPND
   at day 3 recovery time. However, only those exposed to chronic NLHS
   showed the VPAHPND protection at day 7 and day 30 recovery times.
   Furthermore, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of heat
   shock proteins, LvHSP70, LvHSP90 as well as other immune-related genes,
   LvproPO and LvCrustin, were induced upon exposure of shrimp to chronic
   NLHS. Interestingly, gene silencing of LvHSP70 and LvHSP90 eliminated
   the VPAHPND tolerance in the chronic NLHS shrimp and had decreasing PO
   activity suggesting that these LvHSPs played crucial roles in bacterial
   defense in shrimp. All together, we show for the first time that the
   NLHS enhance the shrimp tolerance to VPAHPND infection and this is
   likely mediated by the induction of LvHSP70, LvHSP90 and subsequent
   activation of the proPO system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Exploring the infection strategy of Colletotrichum fructicola in

Abstract = {The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum fructicola has widely
   occurred in pecan (Carya illinoinensis) in China, seriously affecting
   its fruit yield and quality. However, the details of the infection
   strategy of C. fructicola remain to be elucidated. In this study, unique
   molecular identifier-RNA sequencing (UMI RNA-seq) was used to analyze
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of C. fructicola and candidate
   effectors were predicted. Two candidate effectors were identified during
   the early infection stages of C. fructicola. There were 6,822 DEGs at
   three infection timepoints (6, 24, and 36 h post-inoculation), and these
   genes were involved in spore germination, nutrient uptake,
   detoxification, secretion of toxic substances (such as effectors and
   toxins), inhibition of the host's immune response, and protein
   post-translational modification, which participated in the pathogenic
   process of C. fructicola. Moreover, 191 candidate effectors were
   predicted and their expression trends were divided into five clusters.
   Two candidate effectors Cf-ID1 and Cf-ID2 were selected for functional
   validation, and they were demonstrated to trigger cell death and immune
   response in Nicotiana benthamiana. Cf-ID1 and Cf-ID2 are located in both
   cytoplasm and nucleus and could suppress the infection of C. fructicola
   by eliciting defense responses in N. benthamiana. This study provided
   valuable information for in-depth research on the pathogenesis of C.
   fructicola.},

Abstract = {A multi-method approach was employed to compare the responses of
   Glutatione Transferases (GSTs) in the gills and hepatopancreas of
   Venerupis philippinarum to microcystins (MCs) toxicity. In this way,
   using the cytosolic fraction, the enzymatic activity of GSTs, superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPP2) along with
   the gene expression levels of four GST isoforms (pi, mu, sigma1, sigma2)
   were investigated in both organs of the clams exposed for 24 h to 10, 50
   and 100 g L-1 of MC-LR. Cytosolic GSTs (cGSTs) from both organs of the
   high dose exposed clams were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity
   chromatography, characterized kinetically and the changes in the
   expression of cGSTs of the gills identified using a proteomic approach.
   MC-LR caused an increase in GST enzyme activity, involved in conjugation
   reactions, in both gills and hepatopancreas (100 g L-1 exposure). SOD
   activity, an indicator of oxidative stress, showed significantly
   elevated levels in the hepatopancreas only (50 and 100 g L-1 exposure).
   No significant changes were found in PPP2 activity, the main target of
   MCs, for both organs. Transcription responses revealed an up-regulation
   of sigma2 in the hepatopancreas at the high dose, but no significant
   changes were detected in the gills. Kinetic analysis evidenced
   differences between gills of exposed and non-exposed extracts. Using
   proteomics, qualitative and quantitative differences were found between
   the basal and inducible cGSTs. Overall, results suggest a distinct role
   of GST system in counteracting MCs toxicity between the gills and the
   hepatopancreas of V. philippinarum, revealing different roles between
   GST isoforms within and among both organs.},

Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {942-958},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Eradication and maintenance management of island invasive species have
   long histories, and incremental improvements of existing technologies
   plus occasional novel approaches have led to more challenging targets
   and increased success rates in certain categories. Many nonnative
   mammals have been eradicated from islands, as have several nonnative
   birds, insects, and plants. Hundreds of rat populations have been
   eliminated, with a success rate over 80\%, and islands over 10,000 ha
   are now feasible targets. Mouse eradication has proven more challenging,
   but aerial broadcast of anticoagulant toxins has led to increased
   success. Carnivore eradication-especially of feral housecats and
   foxes-has been frequently attempted with a recent success rate over
   90\%. Eradication of herbivores-primarily goats, rabbits, wild boar, and
   boar/pig hybrids-has been attempted almost 200 times, with a success
   rate over 90\%. Trends in mammal eradication include more frequent
   attempts and higher success rates on larger islands and inhabited
   islands, as well as attempts targeting multiple invasive species.
   Documented conservation gains from island mammal eradications are
   numerous. For insects, about two-thirds of some 50 island attempts have
   succeeded, and most targeted agricultural pests. No summary statistics
   exist on island plant eradications, but several small infestations have
   been eradicated. Several insect and plant island invaders have been
   maintained at low densities by biological control, and plants have been
   controlled short of eradication by herbicides, often combined with
   physical or mechanical means. Failures in both eradication and
   maintenance management on islands often result from insufficient
   long-term commitment of resources. Excitement and controversy abound
   over the prospect that new techniques relying on molecular genetic
   tools-especially RNA-guided gene drives-may permit eradication or
   maintenance management of nonnative invaders in situations that have
   previously appeared extremely difficult or infeasible. Island
   populations of invertebrates, small mammals, and some plants are
   particularly propitious targets.},

Journal = {DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental
   toxin formed as an unintentional by-product of incomplete combustion.
   Several therapeutic approaches have evolved to combat its toxicity since
   it elicits immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity,
   carcinogenicity and lethality. Search for drugs from natural resources
   especially from seaweeds has become intense due to their enormous
   pharmacological potential. Hence, the present study aims at revealing
   the protective effect of methanolic extract of G. acerosa (MEGA) in
   Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) against TCDD induced toxicity,
   by assessing the antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective
   activities. The results of antioxidant assays suggests that MEGA
   reverted TCDD induced toxicity by causing an alteration in the levels of
   antioxidant enzymes (Catalase {[}CAT], Superoxide dismutase {[}SOD],
   Glutathione peroxidase {[}GPx], Glutathione-S-transferase {[}GST]) and
   Glutathione {[}GSH]. The results of lipid peroxidation assay and protein
   carbonyl content reveal that MEGA protects PBMC from TCDD induced
   macromolecular damage. MEGA was found to exhibit significant (p<0.05)
   anti-apoptotic activity as verified by evaluation of mitochondrial
   membrane potential and AO-EtBr dual staining. In addition, PBMC
   co-treated with MEGA prevented TCDD induced oxidative DNA damage. Levels
   of phase-I detoxification enzymes determined by EROD assay and
   semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that TCDD up-regulates the expression of
   CYP1A1 and upon co-treatment with MEGA, the expression got slightly
   decreased suggesting its protective role. Preliminary phytochemical
   analysis demonstrates that the extract is rich in cardiac glycosides and
   terpenoids. LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of antioxidants
   including caffeic acid, phytol and mannoheptulose in MEGA, which could
   be attributed for the observed protective effect against TCDD induced
   toxicity.},

Title = {Phytochemistry and beneficial impacts of cinnamon (Cinnamomum

Abstract = {Cinnamon is a common spice obtained from the bark of the cinnamon tree
   (Cinnamomum zeylanicum). It has been used for culinary, as well as
   medicinal, purposes since ancient times in various countries. Apart from
   substantial amounts of several nutrients, including carbohydrates,
   proteins, choline, vitamins (A, K, C, B3), and minerals, several
   biological active compounds are present in the extract of oil, which
   contribute to immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiviral, lowering blood
   cholesterol, antimicrobial, lipid-lowering, antihypertension,
   anti-inflammatory, antitumor, gastroprotective, antidiabetic,
   neuroprotective and blood purifying properties. Cinnamon roots serve as
   a hepatic stimulant by improving bile production, eliminating toxins,
   restoring electrolyte balance and regulating hydration and can be used
   for enhancing digestion. In addition, nutritional properties of cinnamon
   powder include positive effects regarding growth, digestion, enhanced
   activity of gut microflora, improvement of immune response, as well as
   improved feed efficiency and health improvement of poultry birds.
   Recently, research focus has been directed towards supplementing broiler
   diets with cinnamon powder as a phytobiotic in order to replace
   synthetic growth promoters. After reviewing the literature, it was found
   that the research at the molecular level to elucidate the mechanisms
   behind the potential of cinnamon as a feed additive in poultry is
   limited, despite its promising impacts. Furthermore, supplementation
   doses vary significantly, i.e., from 0.02 to 7\%. So, the aim of this
   review was to compile the published research related to cinnamon. Hence
   explore its beneficial properties, find out its optimal dosage for uses
   by veterinarians, researchers, and nutritionists, as well as its
   potential to use as a natural feed additive to replace the synthetic
   antibiotic growth promoters in poultry feed.},

Abstract = {In this study, bacteria residing in the gut of the rice weevils
   (Sitophilus oryzae L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) feeding on
   aflatoxin-contaminated corn kernels were isolated and evaluated for
   their ability to suppress Aspergillus flavus and to remove/degrade
   aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Four morphologically distinct S. oryzae
   gut-associated bacterial isolates were isolated and identified as
   Bacillus subtilis (RWGB1), Bacillus oceanisediminis (RWGB2), Bacillus
   firmus (RWGB3), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RWGB4) based on 16S rRNA
   gene sequence analysis. These bacterial isolates inhibited A. flavus
   growth in the dual culture assay and induced morphological deformities
   in the fungal hyphae, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. All
   four bacterial isolates were capable of removing AFB1 from the nutrient
   broth medium. In addition, culture supernatants of these bacterial
   isolates degraded AFB1, and the degradation of toxin molecules was
   confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The bacterial
   isolates, B. subtilis RWGB1, B. oceanisediminis RWGB2, and P. aeruginosa
   RWGB4, were capable of producing antifungal volatile organic compounds
   that inhibited A. flavus growth. These results suggest that the
   bacterial isolates from S. oryzae gut have the potential to bind and/or
   degrade AFB1. Further research on their application in the food and feed
   industries could enhance the safety of food and feed production.},

Abstract = {During the period 12 July 1985 to 23 December 1987, water samples were
   collected in two-week intervals for estimates of Aeromonas species in a
   waste treatment system located in the arid region of Marrakech, Morocco.
   Fecal coliforms, temperature, and chemical oxygen demand were measured
   simultaneously with Aeromonas species densities.  Statistical methods
   were utilized to analyze the significance of average differences and
   temporal patterns of Aeromonas species numbers.
   Removal of Aeromonas in the whole system did not exceed 1.14 log. 
   Aeromonas densities showed significantly higher resistance to the
   treatment process when compared with fecal coliforms; however, abundance
   of the two groups presented a similar seasonal change.  The highest
   numbers occurred during the cold months, while the lowest appeared in
   the warm months.  Statistical time-series analyses of the densities data
   showed the seasonal and cyclic distribution of Aeromonas in this
   treatment plant.
   These temporal changes were simultaneously observed in all the stations
   investigated and were negatively correlated with water temperature
   values.
   Aeromonas populations were dominated by A. caviae and A. hydrophila in
   the inlet samples.  These two species were rapidly eliminated in the
   treatment plant.  The temporal distribution of A. caviae was similar to
   the change in densities of Aeromonas and fecal coliforms.  The seasonal
   fluctuations of abundance of Aeromonas were probably related to this
   species, which dominated in the winter samples but dropped during the
   summer.  Meanwhile, A. sobria dominated all the final effluent samples. 
   This greater survival of A. sobria and its known pathogenicity may limit
   the re-use of treated water for irrigation of fodder plants.},

Abstract = {The detection of toxins in shellfish through reliable methods is
   essential for human health preservation and prevention of economic
   losses in the aquaculture industry. Although no human intoxication has
   been unequivocally linked to gymnodimines or spirolides. these
   phycotoxins are highly toxic by intraperitoneal injection causing false
   positives in lipophilic toxin detection by the mouse bioassay. Based on
   the detection of molecular interactions by fluorescence polarization all
   inhibition assay was developed using fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin and
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-enriched membranes of Torpedo marmorata
   to detect gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl C spirolide. Both toxins.
   classified into the cyclic imine group, inhibit the interaction of
   alpha-bungarotoxin with Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the
   nM range. In this study we analyze the matrix effect of four shellfish
   species on the fluorescence polarization assay. Mussels. Clams. cockles
   and scallops were extracted with acetone and sequentially partitioned
   with n-hexane and chloroform. The interference of these shellfish
   extracts with the alpha-bungarotoxin fluorescence or its binding to the
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was lower than 11\%. The average
   recovery rates of gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl C spirolide using these
   solvents were 90.6 +/- 7.8\% and 896 +/- 3.2\%. respectively with
   variations among species. The quantification range of this fluorescence
   polarization assay for gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl C spirolide in all
   tested species was 80-2000 mu g kg(-1) and 85-700 mu g kg(-1) of
   shellfish meat, respectively. This assay format can be used to detect
   gymnodimine and 13-desmethyl C spirolide in shellfish as a screening
   assay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Enterococci are gut microbes of most land animals. Likely appearing
   first in the guts of arthropods as they moved onto land, they
   diversified over hundreds of millions of years adapting to evolving
   hosts and host diets. Over 60 enterococcal species are now known. Two
   species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, are common
   constituents of the human microbiome. They are also now leading causes
   of multidrug- resistant hospital- associated infection. The basis for
   host association of enterococcal species is unknown. To begin
   identifying traits that drive host association, we collected 886
   enterococcal strains from widely diverse hosts, ecologies, and
   geographies. This identified 18 previously undescribed species expanding
   genus diversity by >25\%. These species harbor diverse genes including
   toxins and systems for detoxification and resource acquisition.
   Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium were isolated from diverse hosts
   highlighting their generalist properties. Most other species showed a
   more restricted distribution indicative of specialized host association.
   The expanded species diversity permitted the Enterococcus genus
   phylogeny to be viewed with unprecedented resolution, allowing features
   to be identified that distinguish its four deeply rooted clades, and the
   entry of genes associated with range expansion such as B- vitamin
   biosynthesis and flagellar motility to be mapped to the phylogeny. This
   work provides an unprecedentedly broad and deep view of the genus
   Enterococcus, including insights into its evolution, potential new
   threats to human health, and where substantial additional enterococcal
   diversity is likely to be found.},

Abstract = {During light organ colonization of the squid Euprymna scolopes by Vibrio
   fischeri, host-derived mucus provides a surface upon which environmental
   V.fischeri forms a biofilm and aggregates prior to colonization. In this
   study we defined the temporal and spatial characteristics of this
   process. Although permanent colonization is specific to certain strains
   of V fischeri, confocal microscopy analyses revealed that light organ
   crypt spaces took up nonspecific bacteria and particles that were less
   than 2 mum in diameter during the first hour after hatching. However,
   within 2 h after inoculation, these cells or particles were not
   detectable, and further entry by nonspecific bacteria or particles
   appeared to be blocked. Exposure to environmental gram-negative or
   -positive bacteria or bacterial peptidoglycan caused the cells of the
   organ's superficial ciliated epithelium to release dense mucin stores at
   I to 2 h after hatching that were used to form the substrate upon which
   V.fischeri formed a biofilm and aggregated. Whereas the uncolonized
   organ surface continued to shed mucus, within 48 h of symbiont
   colonization mucus shedding ceased and the formation of bacterial
   aggregations was no longer observed. Eliminating the symbiont from the
   crypts with antibiotics restored the ability of the ciliated fields to
   secrete mucus and aggregate bacteria. While colonization by V. fischeri
   inhibited mucus secretion by the surface epithelium, secretion of
   host-derived mucus was induced in the crypt spaces. Together, these data
   indicate that although initiation of mucus secretion from the
   superficial epithelium is nonspecific, the inhibition of mucus secretion
   in these cells and the concomitant induction of secretion in the crypt
   cells are specific to natural colonization by V. fischeri.},

Abstract = {A postcolumn reaction system based on droplet microfluidics was
   developed for capillary electrophoresis (CE). Analytes were separated
   using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and electrophoretically
   transferred into droplets. The use of a micro cross for positioning a
   salt bridge-electrode opposite the separation capillary outlet is the
   key element for maintaining the electrical connection during
   electrophoretic separation. As the first of its kind, positioning the
   droplets in the electric field eliminated the need for electroosmotic
   flow (EOF) or hydrodynamic flow for droplet compartmentalization.
   Depending on the total flow rate of both aqueous and oil phases,
   droplets of water-in-oil could be formed having frequencies between 0.7
   and 3.7 Hz with a size of approximately 14 nL per droplet.
   Compartmentalized in the droplets, analytes reacted with reagents
   already present in the droplets to facilitate detection. The periodate
   oxidation of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) was demonstrated,
   overcoming the limitation of precolumn oxidation, which results in
   multiple and sometimes identical oxidation products formed from the
   different PSTs. Compartmentalization allows the oxidation products for
   each peak to be contained and to contribute to a single fluorescence
   signal, preserving the selectivity of CZE separation while gaining the
   sensitivity of fluorescence detection.},

Title = {Paneth Cells: Recent Updates on Elucidating Therapeutic Implications in
   Gastroenterological Disease Management},
Journal = {CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 18},
Abstract = {Background The human intestine is continuously exposed to a variety of
   aggressive agents, including food antigens, xenobiotics, numerous
   pathogenic microorganisms, metabolic products, and toxins. Consequently,
   it has developed a specialized system for protection against these
   adverse factors.Objective This study aims to investigate the biochemical
   compounds synthesized by Paneth cells and their mechanisms of action to
   develop new therapeutic approaches for gastroenterological
   diseases.Methods We conducted a systematic review, excluding a
   comprehensive meta-analysis, of the current scientific literature
   sourced from electronic libraries (CyberLeninka, e-Library.ru, and
   Cochrane Library), search engines (Google Scholar, Embase, and Global
   Health), and scientific databases (Elsevier, Medline, PubMed-NCBI,
   eMedicine, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and ReleMed and
   Scopus). Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 104 articles were
   initially selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   After careful evaluation, 63 articles were included in this
   study.Results Our findings indicate that Paneth cells play a crucial
   role in regulating small intestine homeostasis by secreting numerous
   biologically active molecules. A key feature of these cells is their
   ability to recognize soluble microbial products via pattern recognition
   receptors and respond by releasing a variety of antimicrobial peptides
   and enzymes. These secretions contribute to the formation of a
   biochemical barrier that prevents pathogen adhesion and translocation.
   Paneth cells are integral to immunological protection, maintaining
   protective inflammatory responses under both normal and pathological
   conditions. Additionally, they regulate the division, growth, and
   differentiation of intestinal stem cells, ensuring proper enterocyte
   localization. Paneth cells also aid digestive processes through enzyme
   secretion and are the only epithelial cells capable of eliminating
   activated autoreactive lymphocytes and abnormal enterocytes.Conclusion
   Paneth cells are unique epithelial cells that, through the synthesis of
   numerous biologically active molecules, control the timely regeneration
   of the intestinal epithelium, maintain a healthy microbiota, and prevent
   infectious, autoimmune, and cancerous diseases. Understanding their role
   in these processes is crucial for developing new therapies for
   gastroenterological diseases.},

Title = {Are yessotoxins an emerging problem in Chile? Context and perspectives
   following the first report of YTX levels exceeding the regulatory limit
   in the Patagonian fjord system},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {361},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In late summer and early autumn 2022, an intense bloom of Protoceratium
   reticulatum-the main yessotoxin (YTX) producer along Chilean coasts and
   a major threat to artisanal fisheries, the aquaculture industry, and
   environmental health-was recorded in the Patagonian fjord system. The
   high YTX levels (>3.75 mg kg(-1)) resulted in the first ban of shellfish
   collection in Chile. At Puyuhuapi Fjord, a global ``hotspot{''} of
   harmful algal bloom events, the cell density of P. reticulatum
   determined in integrated tube samples (0-10 m) at the end of April 2022
   reached 407,000 cells L-1. At the same time, YTX levels well exceeded
   the regulatory limit by roughly 2.5-fold, with concentrations as high as
   9.42 mg kg(-1) measured in native populations of the blue mussel Mytilus
   chilensis. Five different YTX analogues, 45-OH-YTX, COOH-45-keto-YTX,
   COOH-45-OH-YTX, COOH-YTX, and 45,55-diOH-YTX, were also detected in
   relevant amounts. While the ban lasted close to 3 months, accumulation
   and detoxification processes were monitored over a 1-year period. This
   study assessed the implications of high levels of YTXs and their
   analogues on the local economy and ecosystem health, given the increase
   in P. reticulatum blooms predicted for NW Patagonia in the context of a
   changing climate.},

Journal = {CURRENT GENOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {615-629},
Abstract = {Background: Cellular homeostasis is regulated by the intricate interplay
   between a plethora of signaling pathways and ``energetic sensors{''} in
   organs. In order to maintain energy balance, induction or repression of
   metabolic pathways must be regulated and act in concert with the
   energetic demands of the cell at a given point in time. A new class of
   small noncoding RNAs, the microRNAs (miRNAs), has added yet further
   complexity to the control of metabolic homeostasis.
   Objective: Understanding the damages induced by toxins in the liver and
   the intestine as well as the interplay between the miRNome and
   transcriptome first requires baseline characterization in these tissues
   in healthy animals under cellular homeostasis.
   Methods: The liver (main site for detoxification) and the gut (primary
   exposure routes for contaminant exposure) were dissected out (wildtype
   fish), total and small RNA extracted, mRNA and miRNA libraries
   constructed and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Differential
   Expression (DE) analysis was performed comparing liver with gut and an
   ``miRNA matrix{''} that integrates the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data was
   constructed.
   Results: Both the miRNome and transcriptome of the liver and gut tissues
   were characterized and putative novel miRNAs were identified.
   Exploration of the ``miRNA matrix{''} regulatory network revealed that
   miRNAs uniquely expressed in the liver or gut tissue regulated
   fundamental cellular processes important for both organs, and that
   commonly expressed miRNAs in both tissues regulated biological processes
   that were specific to either the liver or the gut.
   Conclusion: The result of our analyses revealed new insights into
   microRNA function in these tissues.},

Abstract = {There are various interspecies differences in xenobiotic-metabolizing
   enzymes. It is known that cats show slow glucuronidation of drugs such
   as acetaminophen and strong side effects due to the UGT1A6 pseudogene.
   Recently, the UGT1A6 pseudogene was found in the Northern elephant seal
   and Otariidae was suggested to be UGT1A6-deficient. From the results of
   measurements of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
   activity using liver microsomes, the Steller sea lion, Northern fur
   seal, and Caspian seal showed UGT activity toward 1-hydroxypyrene and
   acetaminophen as low as in cats, which was significantly lower than in
   rat and dog. Furthermore, UGT1A6 pseudogenes were found in Steller sea
   lion and Northern fur seal, and all Otariidae species were suggested to
   have the UGT1A6 pseudogene. The UGT1 family genes appear to have
   undergone birth-and-death evolution based on a phylogenetic and synteny
   analysis of the UGT1 family in mammals including Carnivora. UGT1A2-1A5
   and UGT1A7-1A10 are paralogous genes to UGT1A1 and UGTA6, respectively,
   and their numbers were lower in cat, ferret and Pacific walrus than in
   human, rat, and dog. Felidae and Pinnipedia, which are less exposed to
   natural xenobiotics such as plant-derived toxins due to their
   carnivorous diet, have experienced fewer gene duplications of
   xenobiotic-metabolizing UGT genes, and even possess UGT1A6 pseudogenes.
   Artificial environmental pollutants and drugs conjugated by UGT are
   increasing dramatically, and their elimination to the environment can be
   of great consequence to cat and Pinnipedia species, whose low xenobiotic
   glucuronidation capacity makes them highly sensitive to these compounds.},

Abstract = {The peroxisomal matrix oxidase, catalase and peroxidase are imported
   peroxisomes through the shuttling receptors, which regulates the
   cellular oxidative homeostasis and function. Here, we report that PTS1
   shuttling receptor FvPex5 is involved in the localization of PTS1,
   utilization of carbon sources and lipids, elimination ROS, cell wall
   stress, conidiation, fumonisin B1 (FB1) production, and virulence in
   maize pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Significantly, differential
   expression of PTS1-, PTS2-, PEX-and FB1 toxin-related genes in wild type
   and Delta Fvpex5 mutant were examined by RNA-Seq analyses and confirmed
   by RT-PCR assay. In addition, different expression of PTS1 and PTS2
   genes of the Delta Fvpex5 mutant were enriched in diverse biochemical
   pathways, such as carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, lipid
   metabolism and the oxidation balance by combining GO and KEGG
   annotations. Overall, we showed that FvPex5 is involved in the
   regulation of genes associated with PTS, thereby affecting the oxidation
   balance, FB1 and virulence in F. verticillioides. The results help to
   clarify the functional divergence of Pex5 orthologs, and may provide a
   possible target for controlling F. verticillioides infections and FB1
   biosynthesis.},

Abstract = {Iron, copper, and zinc play integral roles in the battle against
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection; however, they are often
   trapped between nutrients and toxins, posing a significant challenge to
   macrophages and Mtb to utilize them. Due to this two-sided effect,
   macrophages and Mtb strictly regulate metal uptake, storage, and
   excretion. This review discusses the balanced regulation of iron,
   copper, and zinc in macrophages and Mtb during infection, focusing on
   the intracellular metal regulatory system. Macrophages typically use the
   two-sided effect of metals to limit Mtb access to nutrients or poison
   them. Mtb has developed a metal metabolism regulatory mechanism
   compatible with the nutritional immune strategy. This includes the
   mediation of relevant metalloproteins and metalloenzymes to maintain the
   multimetal balance. This review also explored the regulation of metal
   metabolism homeostasis in macrophages resistant to Mtb infection,
   providing a theoretical foundation for identifying potential clinical
   targets for Mtb infection, developing metalloid anti-tuberculosis drugs,
   and understanding the immune mechanisms against intracellular Mtb
   infection.},

Abstract = {Deciphering the mechanisms that allow the induction of strong immune
   responses is crucial to developing efficient vaccines against infectious
   diseases and cancer. Based on the discovery that the adenylate cyclase
   from Bordetella pertussis binds to the CD11b/CD18 integrin, we developed
   a highly efficient detoxified adenylate cyclase-based vector (CyaA)
   capable of delivering a large variety of Ags to the APC. This vector
   allows the induction of protective and therapeutic immunity against
   viral and tumoral challenges as well as against transplanted tumors in
   the absence of any added adjuvant. Two therapeutic vaccine candidates
   against human papilloma viruses and melanoma have been developed
   recently, based on the CyaA vector, and are currently in clinical
   trials. We took advantage of one of these highly purified vaccines,
   produced under good manufacturing practice-like conditions, to decipher
   the mechanisms by which CyaA induces immune responses. In this study, we
   demonstrate that CyaA binds both human and mouse CD11b(+) dendritic
   cells (DCs) and induces their maturation, as shown by the upregulation
   of costimulatory and MHC molecules and the production of proinflammatory
   cytokines. Importantly, we show that DCs sense CyaA through the
   TLR4/Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-beta pathway,
   independent of the presence of LPS. These findings show that CyaA
   possesses the intrinsic ability to not only target DCs but also to
   activate them, leading to the induction of strong immune responses.
   Overall, this study demonstrates that Ag delivery to CD11b(+) DCs in
   association with TLR4/Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing
   IFN-b activation is an efficient strategy to promote strong specific
   CD8(+) T cell responses.},

Title = {Estrogenic activity in extracts and exudates of cyanobacteria and green
   algae},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Here is presented some of the first information on interactions of
   compounds produced by cyanobacteria and green algae with estrogen
   receptor signaling. Estrogenic potency of aqueous extracts and exudates
   (culture spent media with extracellular products) of seven species of
   cyanobacteria (10 different laboratory strains) and two algal species
   were assessed by use of in vitro trans-activation assays. Compounds
   produced by cyanobacteria and algae, and in particular those excreted
   from the cells, were estrogenic. Most exudates were estrogenic with
   potencies expressed at 50\% of the maximum response under control of the
   estrogen receptor ranging from 0.2 to 7.2 ng 17 beta-estradiol (E-2)
   equivalents (EEQ)/L The greatest estrogenic potency was observed for
   exudates of Microcystis aerigunosa, a common species that forms water
   blooms. Aqueous extracts of both green algae, but only one species of
   cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon gracile) elicited significant estrogenicity
   with EEQ ranging from 15 to 280 ng 17 beta-estradiol (E-2)/g dry weight.
   Scenedesmus quadricauda exudates and extracts of Aphanizomenon
   flos-aquae were antagonistic to the ER when coexposed to E2. The EEQ
   potency was not correlated with concentrations of cyanotoxins, such as
   microcystin and cylindrospermopsin, which suggests that the EEQ was
   comprised of other compounds. The study demonstrates some differences
   between the estrogenic potency of aqueous extracts prepared from the
   same species, but of different origin, while the effects of exudates
   were comparable within species. The observed estrogenic potencies are
   important namely in relation to the possible mass expansion of
   cyanobacteria and release of the active compounds into surrounding
   water. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of
   the active substance fipronil},
Journal = {EFSA JOURNAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Fipronil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review
   programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as
   amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation
   requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer
   review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report
   (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide
   within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the
   EU-Commission.
   France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on
   fipronil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the
   amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on
   10 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review
   was initiated on 15 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of
   the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the
   comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member
   State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation
   meeting in 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data
   made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series
   of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005.
   A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took
   place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006
   leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report.
   The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the
   representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which
   comprises seed dressing to control soil insects and wireworms in
   sunflower and maize at application rate up 30 g fipronil per hectare for
   sunflower (up to 500 g fipronil per 100 kg seeds) and up to 50 g per
   hectare for maize (up to 250 g per 100 kg seeds), respectively. It
   should be noted that due to the fact that the applicant has changed,
   some representative uses are not longer supported for the EU review by
   the new applicant. Fipronil can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It
   should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated
   that only the use as insecticide will be supported in the EU review
   programme.
   The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ``Regent
   500FS{''} ({''}EXP80415A{''}), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment
   (FS), registered in some Member States of the EU. The WG-and the GB
   formulation (EXP60720A and EXP61840A, respectively) are not longer
   supported for the EU review process (i.e. with respect to Annex I
   inclusion) by the new applicant. However, the submitted data package was
   evaluated in the DAR, but the peer review was not completed.
   Adequate methods to monitor all compounds given in the respective
   residue definition are available only for food and air. Residues in food
   of plant origin can be determined with a multi-residue method (The
   German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only
   single methods are available to determine residues of fipronil.
   Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to
   physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that
   quality control measurements of the plant protection product are
   possible.
   Rapidly and extensively absorbed and distributed, fipronil may
   bioaccumulate but is readily metabolised, and slowly excreted via
   faeces. Fipronil is toxic by oral, inhalation and dermal acute exposure.
   It is slightly skin and eye irritating, and weakly sensitising, but not
   sufficiently to be classified. The proposed classification is T,
   R23/24/25 ``Toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if
   swallowed{''}.
   Adverse effects in the short term studies are observed in the central
   nervous system, liver and thyroid. The proposed classification by ECB is
   T, R48/25 ``Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged
   exposure if swallowed{''}, to be voted in the 30th ATP. No genotoxic or
   carcinogenic potential is demonstrated. The mechanism for induction of
   thyroid tumours was discussed by the experts and considered rat specific
   and not relevant to humans.
   Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity is observed. In specific
   neurotoxicity studies, no histopathological findings are observed in the
   nervous system.
   The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable
   Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0035 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute
   Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.009 mg/kg bw, with a safety factor of 100.
   As the use of the Seed Tropex model was considered not fully appropriate
   by the experts, the operator exposure was evaluated with a field study,
   resulting in an exposure below the AOEL without PPE. Worker exposure is
   89\% of the AOEL without PPE, for a 8-hour working day. Bystander
   exposure is not likely to be an issue for seed treatments and has to be
   addressed at Member State level.
   The metabolism of fipronil has been investigated on five different crops
   representative for cereals, pulses and oilseed, roots and tubers using
   either soil applications or seed treatment. A common metabolic pathway
   could be defined for the three crop groups tested and a relevant
   metabolite (sulfone metabolite MB 46136) was demonstrated to be present.
   Even though there were concerns on an acutely toxic by oral
   administration photo degradation product of fipronil, MB 46513, the
   experts' meeting on residues concluded that the compound is basically
   not relevant in relation to seed treatment uses. However, a label
   restriction has been proposed to ensure that treated seed remains stored
   in the dark to prevent photo degradation processes. In supervised
   residue trails no residues of fipronil and of its sulfone metabolite
   were observed at harvest of maize grain and sunflower seed. Trials
   results are suitable to propose MRLs at LOQ level. Even though
   calculated animal intakes were well below the trigger of 0.1 mg/kg,
   there is a need to consider residues in animal products since fipronil
   is classified fat soluble and the ADI is very low. Based on the
   available livestock metabolism and feeding studies, MRLs for food of
   animal origin were proposed.
   In a consumer risk assessment the TMDI was demonstrated to exceed the
   ADI for toddlers and infants, mainly due to the fact that milk
   consumption accounted for the most significant contribution of pesticide
   intake in terms of the total dietary assessment. However, in a refined
   chronic dietary risk assessment the IEDI/NEDI was below the ADI for all
   considered consumer groups (adults, toddles, infants) and thus, it is
   unlikely that exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone residues from
   seed treatment will pose a high chronic risk to consumers. In an acute
   dietary risk assessment the estimated exposure of all considered
   consumer groups was well below the proposed ARfD. Under laboratory
   aerobic conditions fipronil is moderate to high persistent in soil.
   Major metabolites are the amide RPA 200766(3), the sulphone MB 46136(4)
   and the sulphide MB 45950(5). Mineralization is very low.
   Under dark aerobic conditions at metabolite RPA 20076(6) is high
   persistent, RPA 200761(6) moderate to high persistent, MB 45950 medium
   to high persistent, MB 46136 high persistent and MB 46513(7) moderate to
   medium persistent. Most of the measured half lives are longer than the
   duration of the studies and therefore uncertain.
   Photolysis may contribute slightly to the environmental dissipation of
   fipronil in soil yielding two metabolites not previously detected in the
   dark aerobic degradation studies: MB 46513 (more acutely orally toxic
   than fipronil) and RPA 104615(8).
   Available field studies confirmed that fipronil is medium to high
   persistent in soil when not exposed to light (soil incorporated). When
   exposed to light the toxic metabolite MB 46513 is detected. Two field
   accumulation studies were submitted by the applicant after the DAR was
   finalised. A clear tendency for accumulation of fipronil metabolites is
   demonstrated. Plateau for metabolites had not been reached after the
   five or six years of repeated applications. The PEC soil calculation
   submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised do not represents
   a worst case with respect to the parent compound. Furthermore, the
   assumptions taken in the calculation are not well justified. Calculation
   of the initial and 21 d TWA-PECS for the parent compound and soil
   metabolites are also needed to finalise the ecotoxicological risk
   assessment. According adsorption / desorption studies fipronil is low to
   medium mobile, MB 45950 and MB 46136 are immobile to low mobile, MB
   46513 is low mobile and RPA 200766 is medium to high mobile.
   Hydrolysis will not contribute to the degradation of fipronil in the
   environment. However, photolysis may contribute to the degradation of
   fipronil and its major metabolites in water. Fipronil is not readily
   biodegradable in water.
   In water/sediment system fipronil is adsorbed on the sediment where
   degrades to MB 45950. In the water phase fipronil and the major
   metabolite RPA 200766 reached levels above 10 \% AR.
   PECSW/SED were provided by the applicant after the DAR was finalised.
   However, new calculations are needed with parameters updated following
   FOCUS guidance. New PECGW were provided by the applicant after the DAR
   had been finalized. Only the application rate of 50 g/ha for maize has
   been simulated. Results of these new calculations show that metabolite
   RPA 200766 exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for five of the seven
   scenarios simulated. This metabolite has been assessed to be not
   toxicological relevant (see 2.8) but it is considered ecotoxicological
   relevant (see 5.2). Due to the deviations with respect to guidelines on
   the input parameters selection and the need of justification for the use
   of field kinetic parameters a data gap for new FOCUS PECGW calculation
   with appropriate input parameters has been identified.
   Long range transport and deposition of fipronil may be considered
   negligible.
   A high acute, short and long term risks to granivorous birds were
   identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use
   as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. The risk to birds should
   focus on the acute and short term risk as there is no indication that
   fipronil is a reproductive toxin. A new risk assessment for granivorous
   birds taking into account the concerns raised at the EPCO 27 experts'
   meeting is required. The risk to small and large granivorous birds must
   be quantified. The current proposed extrapolation from maize to
   sunflowers is not acceptable.
   Also for granivorous mammals a high acute and long term risk were
   identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use
   as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. A revised risk assessment
   for granivorous mammals taking into account the concerns raised at EPCO
   27 is required. The availability of treated seeds for mammals should be
   assessed to indicate whether mice consumed drilled maize and sunflower
   seeds. The risk to granivorous birds and mammals from the use of
   fipronil as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can only be
   concluded once recently submitted data are evaluated.
   The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the representative uses
   of fipronil as a seed dressing is considered to be low.
   The risk to earthworm and fish-eating birds and mammals can be
   considered low based on the currently available PECs and PECsw-values.
   The risk to earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals from the
   representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to
   still open questions regarding the calculation of PEC in surface water
   and soil.
   The risk to aquatic organisms is based on the most sensitive species,
   Mysidopsis bahia. If the applicant would like to pursue the argument
   that marine species are more sensitive than freshwater species then a
   more robust justification must be provided. The risk to aquatic
   organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not
   be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of
   PECsw values. Based on the available provisional PECsw values a high
   acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms was identified for the
   representative use as a seed treatment in maize. The risk to aquatic
   organisms for the representative use in sunflower can be regarded as
   low. The RMS proposed to refine the long term risk by using an endpoint
   for M. bahia from a study in the presence of sediment. The EFSA
   considers that in order to accept this refinement option, an assessment
   in line with the conclusion of the PPR Panel on dimoxystrobin should be
   presented. The experts' meeting agreed that it might be possible to
   reduce the standard uncertainty factor due to the number of species
   tested. The EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel
   regarding the reduction of the uncertainty due to the availability of
   several single species studies and proposes to take this opinion into
   account at MS-level. Based on the present PECsw values the risk from the
   metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 for the representative
   uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can be regarded as low
   except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates from MB 46136 in
   maize. Also for the refinement of this risk the EFSA would like to refer
   to the opinion of the PPR Panel on the lowering of aquatic trigger
   values. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fipronil is considered
   to be low. The EFSA proposes that a study on bioaccumulation in fish
   from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 should be
   submitted as the Log Pow of these metabolites exceeds 3.
   A very high acute contact and oral toxicity of fipronil to bees were
   observed in the laboratory toxicity studies. The metabolite MB 46136
   showed a similar toxicity to bees as fipronil and the metabolite RPA
   200761 showed a lower toxicity to bees than fipronil. The EPCO experts'
   meeting considered the risk to adult bees for the representative uses as
   a seed treatment in maize and sunflower addressed based on the low
   exposure situation observed in monitoring studies and the observation of
   no adverse effects in the tunnel studies. The risk to bees can only be
   concluded once recently submitted data on the risk to bee brood are
   evaluated. Furthermore the EFSA would like to highlight that the
   available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and MS
   should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in
   their country.
   A high toxicity to NTA was observed in the laboratory. The EPCO experts'
   meeting identified the need for a new risk assessment for soil dwelling
   arthropods taking into account final results from the ongoing aged
   residue studies on A. bilineata and F. candida. This assessment should
   cover the potential for recovery of impacted species in the field.
   Furthermore the meeting noted that the risk assessment should cover the
   plateau soil PEC for total residues (parent + metabolites). The risk to
   non-target arthropods from the representative uses with the FS
   formulation can only be concluded once recently submitted studies on A.
   bilineata and F. candida are evaluated and the open questions for the
   calculation of PECsoil have been solved.
   The risk to soil macro-organisms can be considered low at a
   concentration of 0.785 mg a.s./kg soil and the risk to soil
   micro-organisms can be considered as low at a concentration of 0.667 mg
   a.s./kg soil for fipronil and 0.60, 0.133 and 0.267 mg/kg soil for MB
   46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 respectively. The risk to soil non-target
   macro-and micro-organisms from the representative uses with the FS
   formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding
   the calculation of PECsoil.
   The risk to earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for
   sewage treatment is considered to be low.},

Abstract = {The bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of cholera, is
   often found attached to plankton, a property that is thought to
   contribute to its environmental persistence in aquatic habitats. The C:
   cholerae O1 EI Tor biotype and V cholerae O139 strains produce a surface
   pilus termed the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA), whereas V.
   cholerae O1 classical biotype strains do not. Although I I cholerae O1
   classical does not elaborate R ISI-LJ, the gene is present and expressed
   at a level comparable to that of the other strains. Since V. cholerae O1
   El Tor and V. cholerae O139 have displaced I. cholerae O1 classical as
   the major epidemic strains over the last fifteen Sears, we investigated
   the potential role of MSHA in mediating adherence to plankton, We found
   that mutation of mshA in V cholerae O1 EI Tor significantly diminished,
   but did not eliminate, adherence to exoskeletons of the planktonic
   crustacean Daphnia pulex. The effect of the mutation was more pronounced
   for I: cholerae O139, essentially eliminating adherence. Adherence of
   the V. cholerae O1 classical mskA mutant was unaffected. The results
   suggest that MSW is a factor contributing to the ability of T cholerae
   to adhere to plankton, The results also showed that both biotypes of lr
   cholerae O1 utilize factors in addition to MSHA for zooplankton
   adherence. The expression of MSHA and these additional, yet to be
   defined, adherence factors differ in a serogroup- and biotype-specific
   manner.},

Title = {Pre-ingestive selection capacity and endoscopic analysis in the
   sympatric bivalves Mulinia edulis and Mytilus chilensis
   exposed to diets containing toxic and non-toxic dinoflagellates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of toxic and non-toxic
   dinoflatellates on two sympatric bivalves, the clam Mulinia edulis and
   the mussel Mytilus chilensis. Groups of bivalves were fed one of three
   diets: (i) the toxic paralytic shellfish producing (PSP) Alexandrium
   catenella + Isochrysis galbana; (ii) the non-toxic Alexandrium affine +
   Isochrysis galbana and (iii) the control diet of Isochrysis galbana.
   Several physiological traits were measured, such as, clearance rate,
   pre-ingestive selection efficiency and particle transport velocity in
   the gill. The clearance rates of both M. chilensis and M. edulis showed
   a significant reduction when fed a mixed toxic diet of 50\% Alexandrium
   catenella: 50\% Isochrysis galbana. Similarly, when both species of
   bivalves were fed with the non-toxic diet (50\% A. affine: 50\% I.
   galbana), clearance rate was significantly lower compared with a diet of
   100\% I. galbana. Under all the experimental diets, M. chilensis showed
   higher clearance rate values, slightly more than double that of M.
   edulis. M. edulis and M. chilensis have the ability to select particles
   at the pre-ingestive level, thus eliminating a larger proportion of the
   toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella as well as the non-toxic A. affine in
   the form of pseudofaeces. Higher values of selection efficiency were
   registered in M. edulis than in M. chilensis when exposed to the toxic
   diet. Similar results were observed when these two species were exposed
   to the diet containing the non-toxic dinoflagellate, explained by the
   fact that the infaunal Mulinia edulis is adapted to dealing with larger
   particle sizes and higher particle densities (Navarro et al., 1993). The
   lower transport particle velocity observed in the present work for both
   species, is related to the reduced clearance rate, the higher particle
   concentration, and the presence of larger, toxic dinoflagellates. In
   addition, the species differ in their feeding responses to diets, with
   and without A. catenella or A. affine, largely reflecting their
   adaptations to different environmental conditions. The results suggest
   that the presence of a dinoflagellate bloom, whether toxic or non-toxic
   spp in Yaldad Bay, is likely to have a greater impact on the Mytilus
   chilensis than the infaunal Mulinia edulis, based on the combined
   effects on clearance rate, selection efficiency and particle transport
   velocity.},

Abstract = {The food habits and behavior of medium and large-sized mammals that
   visited natural salt-licks in a tropical rainforest of Belum-Temengor
   Forest Complex, Peninsular Malaysia, were analyzed to understand the
   purpose of their salt-lick visits. The study was conducted at the
   wet-type salt-licks, where the animals drink clear water, thus the
   ingestion of clay particles needed for detoxification of plant secondary
   compounds, one of the possible purposes of salt-lick visits, seemed very
   low. Ten herbivorous, seven omnivorous, and four carnivorous species
   were recorded at the salt-licks. 95.3\% of all video capture records of
   animals at the salt-licks were of herbivores, while the records of
   omnivores and carnivores were only 3.5\% and 1.2\%, respectively. These
   results indicated that herbivores visited studied salt-licks much more
   frequently than other food-habit species. The herbivores also tended to
   stay longer at the salt-licks than omnivores and carnivores. In
   addition, water-drinking behaviors were recorded significantly more
   frequently in herbivores (73\% of video captures) than in omnivores
   (28\%) and carnivores (0\%). The carnivores showed only resting,
   passing, and hunting behaviors. The results suggest that the studied
   salt-licks were mainly used by herbivores and some omnivores, possibly
   to supplement minerals and/or alleviate gastrointestinal problems by
   drinking salt-lick water.},

Abstract = {The photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins in aqueous solutions using
   slurry suspensions of TiO2 implies a post-filtration step to retain the
   photocatalyst. In this work, 2D and 3D TiO2 thin films supported in
   inert surfaces was proposed for the solar photocatalytic removal of
   cyanotoxins microcystinLR (MC-LR) or cylindrospermopsin (CYN) in
   distilled and natural water under neutral pH conditions. The
   photocatalytic experiments were performed in a lab-scale tubular
   photoreactor with a compound parabolic collector (CPC) using simulated
   and natural solar radiation. The tubular photoreactor was packed with
   transparent cellulose acetate monoliths (CAM) coated with a P25 paste or
   sol-gel 2D TiO2 film or with a photocatalytic 3D TiO2-loaded exterior
   paint (PC500, VLP7000 and P25). The efficiency of the TiO2
   photocatalytic system in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was also
   assessed. PVC or glass tubes and glass spheres, coated with a
   photocatalytic 3D TiO2-loaded exterior paint, were also tested as inert
   surfaces. The supports used in this work were chosen according to some
   characteristics, such as cost, surface resistance, surface area and
   transmissibility to UV radiation. The toxins MC-LR and CYN were purified
   from Microcysts aeruginosa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cultures,
   respectively. The photocatalytic system P25-CAM/H2O2 can be considered
   the most effective process, considering the cyanotoxins removal
   efficiency, the cost and the simplicity of the preparation. (C) 2014

   Organs of Bombyx mori L. Larvae},
Journal = {TOXINS},

Abstract = {Botanical insecticides derived from neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.)
   seeds have gained significant interest due to their sustainable
   characteristics and low environmental impact. However, their use in
   sericulture remains contentious due to the heightened sensitivity of
   domesticated silkworms to environmental stressors. This study
   systematically investigates the toxicodynamic effects of aqueous neem
   seed extract (ANSE) on fifth instar larvae of Thai multivoltine Bombyx
   mori L., focusing on larval mortality and carboxylesterase (CarE) enzyme
   activity in essential detoxification organs. Larvae were exposed to ANSE
   concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mg L-1 for up to 72 h. Key findings
   highlight a pronounced dose- and time-dependent increase in mortality,
   with an accurately determined LC50 value of 17 mg L-1 at the longest
   time exposure, accompanied by mortality rates reaching approximately
   83\% at the highest concentration tested, indicating considerable
   susceptibility. Additionally, notable and distinct organ-specific
   responses were observed, with significant inhibition of CarE activity in
   the midgut contrasting with elevated activities in the fat body and
   Malpighian tubules. These differential enzymatic responses reveal
   previously undocumented adaptive detoxification mechanisms.
   Consequently, the study advocates cautious and regulated application of
   neem-based insecticides in sericulture, recommending precise management
   of concentrations and exposure durations according to silkworm strain
   sensitivities to ensure optimal silk production.},

Abstract = {Introduction Migraine headache is a widespread neurovascular disorder
   with an enormous social and economic impact. A subgroup of patients
   cannot be managed with pharmacological therapy. Although surgical
   decompression of extracranial sensory nerves has been proposed as a
   valid alternative treatment option, the medical community remains
   reluctant to accept it. Materials and Methods This systematic review was
   conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
   and Meta-analyses guidelines. An electronic search was performed in
   September 2020 on PubMed, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar
   databases for original articles reporting outcomes on migraine surgery.
   Results The search strategy revealed a total of 922 studies, of which 52
   were included in the review. Significant improvement was reported in
   58.3\% to 100\% and complete elimination in 8.3\% to 86.8\% of patients
   across studies. No major complications were reported. Discussion This
   systematic review demonstrates that migraine surgery is an effective and
   safe procedure, with a positive impact in patients' quality of life and
   a reduction in long-term costs. Conclusion There is considerable
   scientific evidence suggesting extracranial migraine surgery is an
   effective and safe procedure. This surgery should be considered in
   properly selected migraineurs refractory to medical treatment.},

   (bw) and a single intravenous (IV) dose of 5 mg/kg bw at 22 +/- 1
   degrees C, respectively. TIF concentrations in tilapia plasma and
   tissues were determined using the isotope dilution HPLC-HESI-MS/MS
   procedure, which was validated according to the guidelines defined by US
   Food and Drug Administration. TIF was well distributed throughout the
   body compartments of tilapia judged by the apparent volume of
   distribution (V-d) >1 L/kg (6.69 L/kg PO and 1.78 L/kg IV). TIF had a
   short mean residence time (MRT; 22.82 h PO and 14.61 h IV) and quick
   total body clearance (CLb) (0.62 L kg(-1) h(-1) PO and 0.60 L kg(-1)
   h(-1) IV). The total area under the curve (AUC(tot)) of plasma were
   32.25 mu g h(-1) ml(-1) (PO) and 8.30 mu g h(-1) ml (IV), respectively,
   and the oral absolute bioavailability (F\%) of TIF was calculated to be
   approximately 97.1\%. For tissue distribution, high concentrations of
   TIF were found in kidney, and the longest MRT was recorded in bile. The
   withdrawal time (WT) of TIF in muscle, skin, liver, kidney, gill, and
   bile was 3.75 (4) and 1.79 (2), 1.77 (2) and 2.06 (3), 6.41 (7) and 1.97
   (2), 6.95 (7) and 3.98 (4), 4.92 (5) and 2.36 (3), and 7.06 (8) and 6.16
   (7) days after PO and IV administration, respectively. The present
   investigations indicated that TIF was quickly absorbed, well
   distributed, rapidly eliminated in tilapia, and it could serve as
   reference data for establishing use regimen and provide useful
   information for the further development of TIF in aquaculture.},

Abstract = {In this study, the toxicity of titanium nano-oxide nanoparticles (TiO2)
   was examined on the immunity and antioxidant system of Pacific oyster,
   Crassostrea gigas. The oysters were collected from the intertidal areas
   of the shores of Imam Khomeini Port in the northwest of the Persian Gulf
   near the Khouzestan Petrochemical Complex (KPCC). The oysters were
   transferred to lab, acclimatized to lab conditions 10 days and then
   exposed to different concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 15 mu g/l) of TiO2 for
   14 days. After exposure period, the digestive gland and hemolymph were
   sampled to determine the activity of antioxidant enzymes {[}superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] and
   immune parameters (total counts of homocytes, phagocytosis)
   respectively. Exposure to TiO2 significantly decreased the total counts
   of homocytes and phagocytosis activity compared to control, especially
   in exposure concentrations more than 10 mu g/l (p < 0.01). The SOD and
   CAT activities elevated significantly in response to 5 mu g/l TiO2 (p <
   0.01). While, the high concentrations of TiO2 (10 and 15 mu g/l)
   significantly decreased the activity of all antioxidant enzymes (p <
   0.01). The activity of GPx showed significant decreased in the oysters
   exposed to 10 and 15 mu g/l TiO2 compared to control (p < 0.01). The MDA
   levels showed significant increases in oysters exposed to TiO2 compared
   to control (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this study reveals that the
   environmentally relevant concentrations of TiO2 could reduce the
   immunity and antioxidant defence in the Pacific oyster. Therefore,
   special attentions should be paid to eliminate or minimize this
   contaminant in the coastal areas around the KPCC.},

Abstract = {Microcystins accumulate in aquatic organisms and can be transferred to
   higher trophic levels, eventually affecting vector animals and
   consumers. We examined three levels of an aquatic food chain
   (Microcystis aeruginosa, Daphnia magna and Macrobrachium rosenbergii) to
   identify the transfer efficiency and risk of microcystin on prawns.
   Samples were analysed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (MS)/MS and microcystin-LR (MC-LR) distributions in prawn
   tissues were studied. The results showed that prawns accumulate MC-LR
   both directly from M. aeruginosa and indirectly through D. magna which
   was pre-exposed to M. aeruginosa. MC-LR was detected in the gills,
   digestive tracts and hepatopancreas of the prawns 2 h after exposure.
   MC-LR accumulated in prawns to 0.49 +/- 0.04 lg g(-1) dry weight in
   hepatopancreas within 24 h, while it was not detected in muscle samples,
   and rarely appeared in blood samples in such a short period. Although
   MC-LR was not detected in muscle, the head including hepatopancreas of
   the prawns accumulated troublesome amounts of MC-LR. These results
   demonstrate that microcystis blooms in prawn farming potentially pose a
   risk to human consumers, although prawns may be exposed to the bloom for
   a very short time, hence regular monitoring of blue green algae
   population is recommended.},

Title = {Multi-Soil-Layering Technology: A New Approach to Remove Microcystis
   aeruginosa and Microcystins from Water},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Eutrophication of surface waters caused by toxic cyanobacteria such as
   Microcystis aeruginosa leads to the release of secondary metabolites
   called Microcystins (MCs), which are heptapeptides with adverse effects
   on soil microbiota, plants, animals, and human health. Therefore, to
   avoid succumbing to the negative effects of these cyanotoxins, various
   remediation approaches have been considered. These techniques involve
   expensive physico-chemical processes because of the specialized
   equipment and facilities required. Thus, implementing eco-technologies
   capable of handling this problem has become necessary. Indeed,
   multi-soil-layering (MSL) technology can essentially meet this
   requirement. This system requires little space, needs simple
   maintenance, and has energy-free operation and high durability (20
   years). The performance of the system is such that it can remove 1.16 to
   4.47 log(10) units of fecal contamination from the water, 98\% of
   suspended solids (SS), 92\% of biological oxygen demand (BOD), 98\% of
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), 92\% of total nitrogen (TN), and 100\% of
   total phosphorus (TP). The only reported use of the system to remove
   cyanotoxins has shown a 99\% removal rate of MC-LR. However, the
   mechanisms involved in removing this toxin from the water are not fully
   understood. This paper proposes reviewing the principal methods employed
   in conventional water treatment and other technologies to eliminate MCs
   from the water. We also describe the principles of operation of MSL
   systems and compare the performance of this technology with others,
   highlighting some advantages of this technology in removing MCs.
   Overall, the combination of multiple processes (physico-chemical and
   biological) makes MSL technology a good choice of cyanobacterial
   contamination treatment system that is applicable in real-life
   conditions, especially in rural areas.},

Abstract = {The co-occurrence of cyanotoxins and taste-and-odor compounds are a
   growing concern for drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) suffering
   cyanobacteria in water resources. The dissolved and cell-bound forms of
   three microcystin (MC) congeners (MC-LR, MC-RR and MC-YR) and four
   taste-and-odor compounds (geosmin, 2-methyl isoborneol, -cyclocitral and
   -ionone) were investigated monthly from August 2011 to July 2012 in the
   eastern drinking water source of Lake Chaohu. The total concentrations
   of microcystins and taste-and-odor compounds reached 8.86 g/L and 250.7
   ng/L, respectively. The seasonal trends of microcystins were not
   consistent with those of the taste-and-odor compounds, which were
   accompanied by dominant species Microcystis and Dolichospermum. The fate
   of the cyanobacteria and metabolites were determined simultaneously
   after the processes of coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation,
   filtration and chlorination in the associated full-scale DWTP. The
   dissolved fractions with elevated concentrations were detected after
   some steps and the breakthrough of cyanobacteria and metabolites were
   even observed in finished water. Chlorophyll-a limits at intake were
   established for the drinking water source based on our investigation of
   multiple metabolites, seasonal variations and their elimination rates in
   the DWTP. Not only microcystins but also taste-and-odor compounds should
   be taken into account to guide the management in source water and in
   DWTPs.},

Title = {Evaluating microcystinase A-based approach on microcystins degradation
   during harvested cyanobacterial blooms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {348},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Addressing notorious and worldwide Microcystis blooms, mechanical algae
   harvesting is an effective emergency technology for bloom mitigation and
   removal of nutrient loads in waterbodies. However, the absence of
   effective methods for removal of cyanobacterial toxins, e.g.,
   microcystins (MCs), poses a challenge to recycle the harvested
   Microcystis biomass. In this study, we therefore introduced a novel
   approach, the ``captured biomass-MlrA enzymatic MC degradation{''}, by
   enriching microcystinase A (MlrA) via fermentation and spraying it onto
   salvaged Microcystis slurry to degrade all MCs. After storing the
   harvested Microcystis slurry, a rapid release of extracellular MCs
   occurred within the initial 8 h, reaching a peak concentration of 5.33
   mu g/mL at 48 h during the composting process. Upon spraying the
   recombinant MlrA crude extract (about 3.36 U) onto the Microcystis
   slurry in a ratio of 0.1\% (v/v), over 95\% of total MCs were degraded
   within a 24-h period. Importantly, we evaluated the reliability and
   safety of using MlrA extracts to degrade MCs. Results showed that
   organic matter/ nutrient contents, e.g. soluble proteins,
   polysaccharides, phycocyanin and carotenoids, were not significantly
   altered. Furthermore, the addition of MlrA extracts did not
   significantly change the bacterial community composition and diversity
   in the Microcystis slurry, indicating that the MlrA extracts did not
   increase the risk of pathogenic bacteria. Our study provides an
   effective and promising method for the pre-treatment of harvested
   Microcystis biomass, highlighting an ecologically sustainable framework
   for addressing Microcystis blooms.},

Abstract = {Livers of flounders caught during August 1995 from the western Gulf of
   Finland and the Archipelago Sea were analyzed for nodularin-R (NODLN) by
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS). Results showed that NODLN was detected in samples
   by both MS techniques. NODLN content in samples varied between 0.082 and
   0.637 mug g(-1) wet weight by LC-MS. Biotransformation products such as
   glutathione adduct were not found in the samples. The results showed
   that intact NODLN can be found in tissues after storage at -700degreesC
   for several years. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {RmZHD Surface-Displayed Escherichia coli for High Efficiency and

Journal = {ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {3127-3134},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Zearalenone (ZEN) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins in the world,
   with estrogenic toxicity leading to significant annual economic losses
   and environmental pollution. RmZHD, a novel ZEN hydrolase, surpasses the
   efficiency of its predecessors but faces challenges in large-scale
   industrial application. In this work, an engineered Escherichia coli
   that can degrade zearalenone is constructed based on synthetic biology
   and surface display methods. It can degrade 94\% of zearalenone at 30
   degrees C in 1 h (the final concentration was 1.898 mu g/mL) and
   effectively degrade ZEN-derived toxins, including zearalanone,
   beta-zearalanol, alpha-zearalenol, and beta-zearalenol. This engineered
   E. coli requires no additional manipulation for the surface display of
   RmZHD and is cost-effective to produce. Moreover, it exhibits the
   capability to degrade ZEN in maize feed while concurrently mitigating
   inflammation in animal reproductive and digestive organs. In summary,
   the engineered E. coli with surface-displayed RmZHD presents a novel
   approach for environmentally sustainable and industrial-scale treatment
   of ZEN.},
