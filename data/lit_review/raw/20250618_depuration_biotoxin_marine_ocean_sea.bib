Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {284},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Marine toxins pose a significant safety risk, leading to human
   intoxications and causing substantial economic losses in
   seafood-producing regions. The development of rapid, cost-effective,
   efficient, and reliable approaches for the containment of these
   substances is therefore crucial in order to mitigate the adverse impact
   of marine toxins. This research conducted a comprehensive review on the
   toxicity and influencing factors of marine toxins production.
   Additionally, depuration technologies, including adsorption, advanced
   oxidation processes, biodegradation, heating treatment, temporary
   maintenance and purification, and drug inhibition, were systematically
   summarized. The study also provided a comparative analysis of the
   advantages and disadvantages of various depuration technologies and
   proposed strategies for future development.},

Title = {BIOTOXIN UPTAKE, RETENTION, AND DEPURATION TRENDS IN PURPLE-HINGED ROCK
   SCALLOPS, CRASSADOMA GIGANTEA (GRAY 1825)},

Abstract = {The purple hinged rock scallop, Crassadoma gigantea (Gray 1825), is a
   species of interest for commercial-scale aquaculture in its native
   range, along the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California,
   Mexico to southeastern Alaska. One serious, unresolved issue, however,
   is the lack of information on uptake, retention, and depuration of algal
   biotoxins in this species. It is known that rock scallops can retain
   high levels of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), including saxitoxin and
   derivatives, within its tissues including the adductor muscle. Paralytic
   shellfish toxins can pose serious public health risks, including
   paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), which can be lethal in humans.
   Diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DST) produced by algal species within the
   genus Dinophysis spp. is another suite of marine biotoxins monitored by
   public health agencies, known to cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning
   (DSP) in humans. This is the first study to investigate dynamics of
   Dinophysis spp., and DST in the rock scallop. The present study examined
   uptake, retention, and depuration of two common toxic algal species and
   associated biotoxins in Puget Sound, WA: Alexandrium catenella (PST) and
   Dinophysis spp. (DST), through multiyear field exposures and controlled
   laboratory studies. Assessment of PST in rock scallop tissues by
   receptor binding assay from field and laboratory studies revealed very
   high and persistent levels of PST in visceral tissue and also PST in
   adductor muscle tissue beyond the FDA limit (80 mu g STX equivalents 100
   g-1 shellfish tissue) for safe shellfish consumption. An estimate of
   total depuration time of PST in rock scallop viscera was inconclusive,
   indicating potentially long depuration times for this species. Toxicity
   levels varied among individuals of the same cohort, size class,
   collection time, and location for both visceral and adductor muscle
   tissues. Laboratory results showed PST levels beyond the FDA limit
   within adductor muscle tissue during a 6-wk depuration period,
   indicating a shucked, adductor-only product for this species will
   require careful testing and management to ensure rock scallops are safe
   for consumption. More research is needed to decouple the complex
   interactions of Dinophysis spp., DST, water quality, and rock scallop
   physiology to inform shellfish managers and public health agencies
   reliably.},

Abstract = {To study the paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) depuration in Japanese
   scallop Patinopecten yessoensis in natural environment, Japanese
   scallops naturally contaminated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins in the Dayao Bay in the northern Huanghai Sea are transited to
   Qipanmo waters in the Bohai Sea of no reported PSTs incidents. The
   levels and profile of PSTs during 30-day depuration are detected by the
   high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection
   (HPLC-FLD). The results show that the toxicity of the PSTs in soft
   tissues decreases to a relatively low level at Day 9. Moreover, the
   depurated ratio at the early stage of the PSTs depuration is higher than
   that at the later stage. The toxicity analysis of dissected organs
   reveals that the digestive gland is the most contaminated PSTs part,
   which is of important implication for the human health and scallop
   aquiculture. The mortality of Japanese scallops during PSTs depuration
   experiment is relevant to PSTs level in the soft tissue.},

Abstract = {The accumulation and depuration of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   toxins in the oyster of Ostrea rivularis Gould (ORG) were investigated
   in this study. Firstly, PSP toxin-accumulating in ORG were produced by
   feeding with the toxic algae Alexandrium minutum cultured in the
   laboratory. The feeding amounts were designed for three concentrations
   of 4.0 x 10(3), 8.0 x 10(3), and 1.2 X 10(4) cells/mL. After 20 day's
   feeding, the toxicity in the ORG became high levels of 28.86, 31.17, and
   38.98 MU/g, respectively. And the toxin-accumulating ORG fed only for 2
   d with 8.0 x 10(3) cells/mL which toxicity was 11.93 MU/g were selected
   for deputation experiment. In the deputation process, the ORG were fed
   with nontoxic microalgae (MA) of Chlorella spp., chitosan (CTS), and MA
   + CTS. Feeding with 8.0 x 10(3) cells/mL MA and 0.05 g/L CTS resulted in
   the largest PSP toxin reduction in the ORG. After 7 d of depuration
   feeding, the toxicity of the PSP toxin decreased from 11.93 to 3.47,
   1.40, and 0.50 MU/g, as determined by the mouse bioassay (MBA). High
   performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence detection systems
   (HPLC-FLD) was applied in the qualitative and quantitative detection of
   PSP toxins in the ORG during accumulation and depuration. Chromatograms
   of samples not containing oxidation and acidulating reagents in the
   mobile phase were used to identify unknown peaks. The HPLC results
   showed that PSP toxicity before depuration was 9.07 MU/g. After 7 d of
   depuration, feeding by CTS and MA + CTS was reduced to 1.41 and 0.12
   MU/g, respectively. The laboratory experiments showed that CTS had a
   remarkable effect on PSP removal in ORG. The toxicity and toxin profiles
   of ORG were investigated by MBA combined with post-column HPLC-FLD. The
   results of both methods supplemented each other, thereby elucidating the
   accumulation, deputation, and transformation of PSP toxins from the
   toxic algae in ORG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The copepod Calanus finmarchicus: A potential vector for trophic
   transfer of the marine algal biotoxin, domoic acid},

Abstract = {The marine algal biotoxin, domoic acid (DA), is produced by certain
   members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. This neurotoxin has been
   responsible for several mass mortality events involving marine birds and
   mammals. In all cases, the toxin was transferred from its algal
   producers through marine food webs by one or more intermediate vectors.
   The ability of some copepod taxa to serve as vectors for DA has been
   demonstrated; however, the role played in DA trophic transfer by Calanus
   finmarchicus. which often dominates N. Atlantic zooplankton assemblages
   and is a primary dietary component of the highly endangered N. Atlantic
   right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), has been uncertain. In the present
   study, we examined the ability of C. finmarchicus to consume
   DA-producing algae and retain the toxin. Results of grazing and toxin
   accumulation/depuration experiments showed that C. finmarchicus consumed
   DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries regardless of the presence or
   absence of morphologically similar, but non-toxic, P. pungens, across
   initial cell concentrations ranging from 1000-4000 cells mL(-1).
   Furthermore, C. finmarchicus did not appear to preferentially consume or
   avoid either Pseudo-nitzschia species tested. After ingestion of P.
   multiseries, copepods accumulated DA and retained it for up to 48 h
   post-removal of the toxin source. These findings provide evidence for
   the potential of C. finmarchicus to facilitate DA trophic transfer in
   marine food webs where toxic Pseudo-nitzschia is present. Published by

Title = {Warm temperature acclimation impacts metabolism of paralytic shellfish
   toxins from Alexandrium minutum in commercial oysters},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3402-3413},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Species of Alexandrium produce potent neurotoxins termed paralytic
   shellfish toxins and are expanding their ranges worldwide, concurrent
   with increases in sea surface temperature. The metabolism of molluscs is
   temperature dependent, and increases in ocean temperature may influence
   both the abundance and distribution of Alexandrium and the dynamics of
   toxin uptake and depuration in shellfish. Here, we conducted a
   large-scale study of the effect of temperature on the uptake and
   depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins in three commercial oysters
   (Saccostrea glomerata and diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas, n =
   252 per species/ploidy level). Oysters were acclimated to two constant
   temperatures, reflecting current and predicted climate scenarios (22 and
   27 degrees C), and fed a diet including the paralytic shellfish
   toxin-producing species Alexandrium minutum. While the oysters fed on A.
   minutum in similar quantities, concentrations of the toxin analogue
   GTX1,4 were significantly lower in warm-acclimated S. glomerata and
   diploid C. gigas after 12 days. Following exposure to A. minutum,
   toxicity of triploid C. gigas was not affected by temperature.
   Generally, detoxification rates were reduced in warm-acclimated oysters.
   The routine metabolism of the oysters was not affected by the toxins,
   but a significant effect was found at a cellular level in diploid C.
   gigas. The increasing incidences of Alexandrium blooms worldwide are a
   challenge for shellfish food safety regulation. Our findings indicate
   that rising ocean temperatures may reduce paralytic shellfish toxin
   accumulation in two of the three oyster types; however, they may persist
   for longer periods in oyster tissue.},

Abstract = {A laboratory experiment was performed with the clam Ruditapes
   decussatus, fed with the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum and
   the non-toxic algae Isochrysis galbana (14 days) and subsequently only
   with I. galbana (15 days). Individual paralytic shellfish toxins were
   determined by LC-FLD in G. catenatum cells, whole clam tissues, and
   particulate organic matter (POM) produced by clams. The toxins dcSTX and
   dcGTX2 + 3 in the algae were less abundant than C1 + 2 and B1, but were
   predominant in clams during both the exposure and depuration phases. The
   toxin dcNEO was only detected in clams during a short period, indicating
   conversion from other compounds. The toxin composition of the POM
   indicated the export of dcSTX as faeces or pseudo-faeces along the
   entire experiment (2.5-14 nmol mg(-1)) B1 was present in a short period
   of the exposure and C1 + 2 and dcGTX2 + 3 absent. A mass balance
   calculation indicated that approximately 95\% of C1 + 2 and 85\% of B1
   supplied to the clams were converted into other toxins or lost in
   solution. Conversely, the net gain of 512, 61 and 31 nmol for dcSTX,
   dcGTX2 + 3 and dcNEO, respectively, suggests the conversion from other
   assimilated compounds by clams during exposure and depuration phases.

Abstract = {Depuration of mussels contaminated by Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST)
   is a potential option for the shellfish industry to manage the impact of
   DST. Field observations have suggested that the main factor regulating
   the rate of deputation of DST is the quantity of nontoxic algae
   available for the mussels to feed upon. In this paper, the effects of
   the quantity of food, which mussels feed upon, on the rate of deputation
   of DST in Mytilus edulis L. was tested in a laboratory experiment.
   Mussels naturally contaminated by the DST okadaic acid (OA) were
   collected from a mussel farm located on the Swedish west coast during a
   bloom event. Individual mussels were placed in filtered seawater and
   given daily rations of a mixture of nontoxic algae as follows: no food,
   0.5\% and 1.5\% of dry weight body mass day(-1). Depuration was
   performed over 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 days. The levels of OA decreased in
   all treatments with time, with an average of approximately 50\%
   reduction after 32 days. No significant differences in content of OA
   among food rations were detected. In contrast to predictions, a trend
   towards lower levels of toxins in the mussels receiving no food compared
   to both food treatments was observed after 32 days of deputation. The
   loss of toxins in mussels that were not feeding correlated with a
   considerable loss in the mass of the digestive gland between 16 and 32
   days. It was concluded that the rate of depuration of OA in mussels is
   not positively correlated with digestive activity and fecal production.
   Instead, the lipophilic character of the OA molecule suggests that OA
   may have affinity for lipid-rich cellular and intracellular components.
   Increased usage of lipid stores, which occur during starvation, may
   accelerate the release of OA. This model could explain the observations
   made during the last part of this experiment. In management of toxic
   mussels, depuration in waters free of toxic algae is not likely to be
   enhanced by increasing the food supply to mussels; however, long periods
   of deputation in the absence of food should be avoided because of the
   negative effects on the condition of the mussels. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {Uptake, transfer and elimination kinetics of paralytic shellfish toxins
   in common octopus (Octopus vulgaris)},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {205-211},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine phycotoxins derived from harmful algal blooms are known to be
   associated with mass mortalities in the higher trophic levels of marine
   food webs. Bivalve mollusks and planktivorous fish are the most studied
   vectors of marine phycotoxins. However, field surveys recently showed
   that cephalopod mollusks also constitute potential vectors of toxins.
   Thus, here we determine, for the first time, the time course of
   accumulation and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in the
   common octopus (Octopus vulgaris). Concomitantly, the underlying
   kinetics of toxin transfer between tissue compartments was also
   calculated. Naturally contaminated clams were used to orally expose the
   octopus to PSTs during 6 days. Afterwards, octopus specimens were fed
   with non-contaminated shellfish during 10 days of depuration period.
   Toxins reached the highest concentrations in the digestive gland
   surpassing the levels in the kidney by three orders of magnitude. PSTs
   were not detected in any other tissue analyzed. Net accumulation
   efficiencies of 42\% for GTX5, 36\% for dcSTX and 23\% for C1+2 were
   calculated for the digestive gland. These compounds were the most
   abundant toxins in both digestive gland and the contaminated shellfish
   diet. The small differences in relative abundance of each toxin observed
   between the prey and the cephalopod predator indicates low conversion
   rates of these toxins. The depuration period was better described using
   an exponential decay model comprising a single compartment the entire
   viscera. It is worth noting that since octopuses' excretion and
   depuration rates are low, the digestive gland is able to accumulate very
   high toxin concentrations for long periods of time. Therefore, the
   present study clearly shows that O. vulgaris is a high-potential vector
   of PSTs during and even after the occurrence of these toxic algal
   blooms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {147},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Comparatively little is known about paralytic shellfish toxin (PST)
   accumulation by marine grazers, yet recurrent blooms of Alexandrium
   catenella have caused repeated closures of wild fisheries and require
   ongoing monitoring. To determine if the commercially harvested
   periwinkle Lunella undulata is at risk of PST uptake, a laboratory
   experiment was conducted exposing the herbivorous/detritovorous marine
   snails to either live or senescent Alexandrium catenella microalgae.
   After 21 days of exposure, the highest PST concentrations were observed
   in the viscera of animals in the senescent and live algal treatments
   (0.55+0.08 and 0.82+0.12 mg STX.2HCl eq./kg, respectively). No
   quantifiable PST was observed in the foot of animals from either
   exposure treatment. The PST profile in the viscera closely matched that
   of the microalgal source, suggesting PST uptake through direct grazing
   of L. undulata on vegetative A. catenella cells. Grazing activity
   remained unchanged throughout the exposure period across all treatments.
   However, periwinkles exposed to A. catenella were significantly slower
   to retract their foot in response to touch than those animals in the
   control treatment (first observed on days 7 and 11 in the dead and live
   algae treatments, respectively). This effect became more pronounced over
   time and coincided with higher PST concentrations. While righting speed
   did not differ between animals exposed to live microalgae and the
   control, those exposed to senescent algae were generally slower to right
   (observed from day 4 onwards). The implications of these findings for
   biotoxin management in periwinkles and related marine grazers are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs represent an important food source within the
   Philippines, but the health of seafood consumers is compromised through
   the accumulation of harmful algal toxins in edible shellfish tissues. In
   order to assess the dynamics of toxin risk in shellfish, this study
   investigated the uptake, depuration, assimilation, and analogue changes
   of paralytic shellfish toxins in Perna viridis. Tank experiments were
   conducted where mussels were fed with the toxic dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium minutum. Water and shellfish were sampled over a six day
   period to determine toxin concentrations in the shellfish meat and
   water, as well as algal cell densities. The maximum summed toxin
   concentration determined was 367 mu g STX eq./100 g shellfish tissue,
   more than six times higher than the regulatory action limit in the
   Philippines. Several uptake and depuration cycles were observed during
   the study, with the first observed within the first 24 h coinciding with
   high algal cell densities. Toxin burdens were assessed within different
   parts of the shellfish tissue, with the highest levels quantified in the
   mantle during the first 18 h period but shifting towards the gut
   thereafter. A comparison of toxin profile data evidenced the conversion
   of GTX1,4 in the source algae to the less potent GTX2,3 in the shellfish
   tissue. Overall, the study illustrated the temporal variability in Perna
   viridis toxin concentrations during a modelled algal bloom event, and
   the accumulation of toxin from the water even after toxic algae were
   removed.},

Title = {Profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of okadaic acid group toxins

   pagurus)},

Abstract = {In 2002, two outbreaks of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occurred
   in Norway, which was later confirmed to be caused by the consumption of
   brown crab (Cancer pagurus) contaminated predominantly by esters of
   okadaic acid (OA) after feeding on toxic blue mussels (Mytilus edulis).
   In addition to OA-group toxins, pectenotoxins (PTXs) are commonly
   detected in the toxin-producing algae (i.e. Dinophysis). In this paper,
   an experiment was set up to study the fatty acid ester profiles and
   depuration rates of OA-group toxins and PTXs from C. pagurus after
   feeding on M. edulis containing these toxin groups. CA, DTX1, DTX2 and
   PTX2 SA were all detected primarily in the form of fatty acid esters in
   the crab hepatopancreas (HP). Crabs preferentially assimilated toxins of
   the OA group after feeding on the mussels for 1 week. Detailed analysis
   of the fatty acid ester profile in crabs and mussels showed that the
   ester profiles in the crabs differed slightly from profiles of the fatty
   acid esters in M. edulis, but neither ester profile nor ester to free
   toxin ratio appeared to change in the crabs during the first 2 weeks of
   deputation. Calculations of deputation rates of the free forms of toxins
   resulted in similar reduction rates for OA and DTX2, whereas the
   depuration rate of DTX1, PTX2 and PTX2 SA was considerably faster. From
   the industrial perspective, the PTX-compounds are of minor importance
   compared to the OA group toxins in crabs, considering (1) the
   uncertainty regarding the oral toxicity of the PTXs, (2) the
   preferential ingestion of OA-group toxins compared to PTXs and (3) the
   faster depuration of PTXs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of okadaic acid group toxins
   and pectenotoxins during toxin depuration. Part II: Blue mussels
   (Mytilus edulis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis)},
Journal = {TOXICON},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs accumulate toxins of the okadaic acid (OA) and
   pectenotoxin (PTX) groups, which are frequently found in Dinophysis spp.
   Transformation of the OA-group toxins into fatty acid ester derivatives
   (often designated ``DTX3{''}) is common in many bivalve species but the
   degree to which these toxins are transformed vary between species, and
   is also depending on the parent toxin involved. In this paper, detailed
   profiles and levels of fatty acid esters of OA, DTX1, DTX2 and PTX2 SA
   were studied in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and European flat oysters
   (Ostrea edulis), collected during a bloom of Dinophysis spp. and after 3
   and 6 weeks of depuration. Analysis of samples by HPLC-MS/MS and
   HPLC-MS2 revealed some differences in identity and abundance of fatty
   acid moieties of the OA-group esters between species, but the 16:0 fatty
   acid esters dominated in both oysters and mussels, which is in
   accordance with the free fatty acid profiles in these species. A wider
   range of FM SA-esters were detected compared to esters of the CA-group
   toxins in both mussels and oysters, and in oysters, both 14:0, 18:4 and
   20:5 fatty acid side chains were more common than 16:0. OA-group toxins
   were esterified to a larger degree in oysters (83-93\%) compared to
   mussels (21-41\%), and in mussels a higher proportion of OA was
   esterified compared to DTX1 and DTX2. Contrary to what was observed for
   CA-group toxins, PTX2 SA was esterified to a larger degree in mussels
   (81\%) compared to oysters (64\%). Calculations of depuration rates for
   all individual esters of each parent compound showed that the esters of
   DTX1 depurated significantly slower from both mussels and oysters
   compared to esters of OA, DTX2 and PTX2 SA, but overall the deputation
   rates of esters of both toxin group were highly similar for both
   species. This indicated that differences in depuration rates are not
   causing the large species-specific differences in levels and profiles of
   these toxins. Instead, the results for the CA-group toxins suggested
   that a higher rate of esterification in oysters is the main factor
   causing the observed differences in the proportion of esters to free
   toxin. For FM SA, large differences in ester profiles and a higher
   proportion of esters of PTX2 SA in mussels compared to oysters suggested
   differential assimilation and metabolic rate processes for the PTXs
   compared to OA-group toxins between these species. Hence, although
   produced by the same Dinophysis species, conclusions about the dynamics
   of one toxin group based on results from the other group should be
   avoided in future studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of marine algal toxins. In this study,
   the accumulation and depuration of pectenotoxins in brown crab Cancer

   extracted with methanol from the digestive glands of contaminated crabs,
   uncontaminated crabs (control group) and from blue mussels for
   comparison. Extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatograph coupled with
   tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The concentrations of PTX-2, PTX-2
   SA, 7-epi-PTX-2 SA, and PTX-12 were analyzed in two batches of toxic
   blue mussels and the crabs. A one-compartment model was applied to
   describe the depuration of PTXs. The half-life of PTXs was estimated to
   be 6-7.5 days. After depuration for 42 days, the amount of PTXs measured
   in the crab digestive glands was less than 1 mu g/kg.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of the most harmful
   neurotoxins distributed worldwide. Marine organism samples, including
   mollusks, crustaceans and fish, collected from 11 sites around the
   coastal water of the South China Sea, were analyzed in terms of the PST
   and toxicity via high-performance liquid chromatography. The PST
   geographical distribution, detectable rate for PST and toxin content all
   increased slightly from 2006 to 2008 to 2015. High PST content with more
   than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in Shantou (ST), Shanwei (SW), Zhanjiang
   (ZJ), Beihai (BH), Xuwen (XW), Haikou (HK), Dongfang (DF), Wanning (WN)
   and Sanya (SY). Low PST content with less than 2 nmol g(-1) appeared in
   Shenzhen (SZ) and Yangjiang (YJ). High PST toxicity over the safety
   limit 800 mu g STXeq/kg appeared in ST, SW, ZJ, BH, DF, SY and XW. PST
   has significant seasonal characteristics and was mostly detected in
   spring, early summer (March-June) and autumn (September-November) in the
   coastal water of the South China Sea. PST was usually detected in some
   specific species of scallop, mussel, bloody clam, hard clam, razor clam,
   oyster, crab, shrimp and fish. Toxin profile variation of marine
   organism samples was influenced greatly by species, sampling time and

Title = {The effect of size and age on depuration rates of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins (DST) in mussels (Mytilus edulis L.)},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Deputation or elimination of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DST) was
   followed for 73 days in 1 - and 2-year-old mussels. The age groups also
   differed in size, providing a broad approach to studying the effect of
   the differences in physiology accompanying the differences in size.
   Content of DST was analysed both on groups and individual mussels.
   Environmental variables were measured to evaluate their effect on
   depuration.
   We found no significant differences in elimination rate of DST between
   1- and 2-year-old mussels under natural conditions. This suggests that
   size and age do not affect the elimination rate of the DST. The present
   study is the first study on the effect of age and size on the
   elimination rate of algal toxins in bivalves. The natural variations in
   food levels and temperature were not found to affect the elimination
   rate of DST. The digestive gland weights in the 1-year-old mussels
   increased four times while the DST content per individual decreased
   eight times.
   This demonstrated that dilution of toxins due to tissue growth could
   have an important contribution to declines in toxin concentrations.
   Changes in tissue mass are affected by environmental variables via
   growth or starvation, and when such changes lead to concentration or
   dilution of toxins this does not reflect the accumulation or removal of
   toxins from the tissues. We hence suggest that when evaluating the
   actual elimination capacity of the mussels, as in the present study, the
   total content of toxins per individual should be used, rather than toxin
   concentrations.
   The 1-year-old mussels had faster growth compared to the 2-year-old
   mussels in both total soft tissue and digestive glands. The mechanism of
   DST elimination is still unknown. If this process involves metabolism of
   the toxins, one could expect the rates of elimination to follow overall
   metabolic rates. However, the results from the present study suggest
   that large differences in growth rates, which also include difference in
   feeding and metabolic rates, do not affect the elimination rate of DST.
   Our results support the assumption that the deputation rates cannot be
   accelerated, even in artificial systems, as a cost-effective way to
   solve the problem with toxic mussels for the industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck) were exposed to the toxic
   cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. emend Elkin for 16 days in
   order to study bioaccumulation of the cyclic heptapeptide toxin
   microcystin-LR. After this time period the animals were fed marine
   phytoplankton for 2 weeks and the amount of microcystin in the mussels
   was monitored again. During the exposure phase mussels attained a
   maximum of 10.5 mu g of toxin per g dry mussel weight at day 10.
   Microcystin was detectable after the second day of exposure. The
   percentage of toxin that was taken up relative to the total amount
   administered varied from 24.1\% to 54.8\%. When the mussels were fed
   marine phytoplankton there was a 50\% decrease in the amount of
   detectable toxin in the mussels within 2 days. This was followed by a
   slight increase in toxin levels over 5 days with no microcystin-LR being
   detected at day 13. The major part of the toxin (96\%) was found in the
   digestive gland + stomach while the gills, muscle, foot, and other
   organs combined had less than 4\% of the total toxin. The results
   presented here show that cyanobacteria blooms present in estuaries where
   bivalves are growing naturally constitute a health hazard in that these
   organisms can retain microcystins and transfer them through the food
   chain.},

Title = {Shellfish Toxin Uptake and Depuration in Multiple Atlantic Canadian
   Molluscan Species: Application to Selection of Sentinel Species in
   Monitoring Programs},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Shellfish toxin monitoring programs often use mussels as the sentinel
   species to represent risk in other bivalve shellfish species. Studies
   have examined accumulation and depuration rates in various species, but
   little information is available to compare multiple species from the
   same harvest area. A 2-year research project was performed to validate
   the use of mussels as the sentinel species to represent other relevant
   eastern Canadian shellfish species (clams, scallops, and oysters).
   Samples were collected simultaneously from Deadmans Harbour, NB, and
   were tested for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and amnesic shellfish
   toxin (AST). Phytoplankton was also monitored at this site. Scallops
   accumulated PSTs and AST sooner, at higher concentrations, and retained
   toxins longer than mussels. Data from monitoring program samples in
   Mahone Bay, NS, are presented as a real-world validation of findings.
   Simultaneous sampling of mussels and scallops showed significant
   differences between shellfish toxin results in these species. These data
   suggest more consideration should be given to situations where multiple
   species are present, especially scallops.},

Title = {Spatial variability and depuration of tetrodotoxin in the bivalve
   Paphies australis from New Zealand},
Journal = {TOXICON-X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin responsible for many human
   intoxications globally. Despite its potency and widespread occurrence in
   taxonomically diverse species, the primary source of TTX remains
   uncertain. Paphies australis, an endemic clam found in New Zealand, has
   been found to contain TTX in several locations. However, it is unknown
   if this represents endogenous production or accumulation from an
   external source. To address this question, the concentrations of TTX in
   whole P. australis and dissected organs (siphons, foot, digestive gland
   and the `rest') from thirteen sites around New Zealand were determined
   using liquid chromato-graphy-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry
   analysis (LC-MS/MS). Depuration rate of TTX was also investigated by
   harvesting and measuring concentrations in P. australis maintained in
   captivity on a toxin-free diet every three to 15 days for 150 days. The
   LC-MS/MS analyses of the spatial samples showed that TTX was present in
   P. australis from all regions tested, with significantly (p < 0.001)
   higher concentrations (15-50 mu g kg(-1)) observed at lower latitudes of
   the North Island compared with trace levels (0.5-3 mu g kg(-1)) in the
   South Island of New Zealand. Tetrodotoxin was detected in all the
   dissected organs but the siphons contained the highest concentrations of
   TTX at all sites analysed. A linear model of the depuration data
   identified a significant (p < 0.001) decline in total TTX concentrations
   in P. australis over the study period. The siphons maintained the
   highest amount of TTX across the entire depuration study. The digestive
   glands contained low concentrations at the start of the experiment, but
   this depurated rapidly and only traces remained after 21 days. These
   results provide evidence to suggest that P. australis does not produce
   TTX endogenously but obtains the neurotoxin from an exogenous source
   (e.g., diet) with the source more prevalent in warmer northern waters.
   The association of higher TTX concentrations in shellfish with warmer
   environments raises concerns that this toxin's distribution and
   abundance could become an increasing human health issue with global
   warming.},

Title = {Comparative dynamics of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) in a tolerant
   and susceptible population of the copepod Acartia hudsonica},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In common-environment experiments, we measured the uptake, accumulation,
   retention, transformation and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs) of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense in adult females of
   two geographically separated populations (Maine and New Jersey, USA) of
   the copepod Acartia hudsonica. These populations were previously shown
   to differ in their history of exposure to Alexandrium blooms, and in
   their degree of adaptation to this dinoflagellate. Toxin accumulation
   was measured at several times in incubations lasting up to 72 h. Toxin
   depuration was assessed after a 60 h incubation of females with toxic A.
   fundyense and subsequent 60 h incubation in a sole diet of the non-toxic
   green flagellate Tetraselmis sp. As previously observed, the Maine
   population had significantly higher toxin ingestion rates. By contrast,
   both toxin accumulation (up to similar to 2.5 ng STX eq. female(-1)) and
   the depuration rate (similar to 0.73 d(-1)) were not significantly
   different between populations. Hence, faster depuration is ruled out as
   a tolerance mechanism in the Maine population. Some toxin transformation
   during both accumulation and depuration was evident in both populations.
   However, differential toxin transformation does not appear to be a
   tolerance mechanism either. In contrast to these results, toxin
   retention (ratio of accumulation/cumulative ingestion) was significantly
   lower in the Maine population. The retentions of gonyautoxin 3 (GTX3)
   and of two of the most potent toxins, neosaxitoxin (NEO) and saxitoxin
   (STX), were also significantly lower in that population. At steady
   state, toxin absorption efficiency was estimated to be 6\% for the Maine
   population and 9\% for the New Jersey population. These results suggest
   that lower toxin absorption is a possible tolerance mechanism for the
   Maine population. The results of the present study also suggest that
   copepod adaptation to toxic dinoflagellates does not necessarily lead to
   higher toxin transfer up the food web. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Three Calanus species, Calanus glacialis, Calanus finmarchicus and
   Calanus hyperboreus, which are the most important zooplankton herbivores
   in Western Greenland, were fed with unialgal cultures of toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia seriata and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima.
   All three copepod species grazed on toxic P. seriata and also
   accumulated domoic acid during the grazing. There were no differences in
   ingestion rates between toxic and non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species in
   any of the copepods. C. finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus grazed on toxic
   P. seriata during the first 6 h of the experiment but seemed to stop
   grazing during the last 6 h of the experiment suggesting that the
   copepods may have suffered some kind of physiological incapacitation due
   to ingestion of domoic acid. C. glacialis grazed on toxic P. serious
   continuously during the whole experiment, probably due to the lower
   domoic acid cell quota of P. seriata during the experiment on C.
   glacialis than on the other two copepod species. The depuration
   experiment on C. glacialis indicated that the copepods still retained
   domoic acid after 10 h of depuration in filtered sea water. The results
   show that the three Calanus species are potential vectors for domoic
   acid to higher trophic levels in the Arctic. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Response of fatty acids and lipid metabolism enzymes during
   accumulation, depuration and esterification of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {206},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Bivalve mollusks accumulate diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) from
   toxigenic microalgae, thus posing a threat to human health by acting as
   a vector of toxins to consumers. In bivalves, free forms of DSTs can be
   esterified with fatty acids at the C-7 site to form acyl esters (DTX3),
   presumably a detoxification mechanism for bivalves. However, the effects
   of esterification of DSTs on fatty acid metabolism in mollusks remain
   poorly understood. In this study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   were fed the DST-producing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima for 10 days
   followed by an additional 10-days depuration in filtered seawater to
   track the variation in quantity and composition of DST acyl esters and
   fatty acids. A variety of esters of okadaic acid (OA) and
   dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) were mainly formed in the digestive gland (DG),
   although trace amounts of esters also appeared in muscle tissue. A large
   relative amount of OA (60\%-84\%) and DTX1 (80\%-92\%) was esterified to
   DTX3 in the visceral mass (referred to as digestive gland, DG), and the
   major ester acyl chains were C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C20:1 and
   C20:2. The DG and muscle tissues showed pronounced differences in fatty
   acid content and composition during both feeding and depuration periods.
   In the DG, fatty acid content gradually decreased in parallel with
   increasing accumulation and esterification of DSTs. The decline in fatty
   acids was accelerated during depuration without food. This reduction in
   the content of important polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), would lead
   to a reduction in the nutritional value of mussels. Enzymes involved in
   lipid metabolism, including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty
   acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL),
   were actively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids in the DG,
   whereas their activities were weak in muscle tissue during the feeding
   period. This study helps to improve the understanding of interactions
   between the esterification of DSTs and fatty acid dynamics in bivalve
   mollusks.},

   abundance/presence of CTX-producing epi-benthic dinoflagellates, e.g.,
   Gambierdiscus spp., and are based on studies showing that toxin
   production is site specific and occurs in pulses driven by environmental
   factors. However, food web models are not yet developed and require
   parameterizing the CTX exposure cascade in fish which has been
   traditionally approached through top-down assessment of CTX loads in
   wild-caught fish. The primary goal of this study was to provide critical
   knowledge on the kinetics of C-CTX-1 bioaccumulation and depuration in
   the marine omnivore Lagodon rhomboides. We performed a two-phase, 17
   week CTX feeding trial in L. rhomboides where fish were given either a
   formulated C-CTX-1 (n = 40) or control feed (n = 37) for 20 days, and
   then switched to a non-toxic diet for up to 14 weeks. Fish were randomly
   sampled through time with whole muscle, liver, and other pooled viscera
   dissected for toxin analysis by a sodium channel-dependent MTT-based
   mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) assay. The CTX levels measured in all tissues
   increased with time during the exposure period (days 1 to 20), but a
   decrease in CTX-specific toxicity with depuration time only occurred in
   viscera extracts. By the end of the depuration, muscle, liver, and
   viscera samples had mean toxin concentrations of 189\%, 128\%, and 42\%,
   respectively, compared to fish sampled at the start of the depuration
   phase. However, a one-compartment model analysis of combined tissues
   showed total concentration declined to 56\%, resulting in an approximate
   half-life of 97 d (R-2 = 0.43). Further, applying growth dilution
   correction models to the overall concentration found that growth was a
   major factor reducing C-CTX concentrations, and that the body burden was
   largely unchanged, causing pseudo-elimination and a half-life of 143-148
   days (R-2 = 0.36). These data have important implications for food web
   CTX models and management of ciguatera poisoning in endemic regions
   where the frequency of environmental algal toxin pulses may be greater
   than the growth-corrected half-life of C-CTX in
   intermediate-trophic-level fish with high site fidelity.},

   from Bivalves Exposed to Gymnodinium catenatum},

Abstract = {The accumulation of marine biotoxins in shellfish and their consumption
   causes serious food safety problems, threatening human health and
   compromising the availability of protein-based food. It is thus urgent
   to develop methodologies for the detoxification of live bivalves,
   avoiding their economic and nutritional devaluation. In this context, we
   tested an adsorption mechanism of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) based
   on a cation-exchange resin. The first studies using cultures of
   Gymnodinium catenatum (natural producers of PST) showed a decrease of
   about 80\% in overall toxicity after 48 h. Interestingly, we found that
   the toxins are adsorbed differently, with toxins' structural features
   playing a part in the adsorption capacity via steric hindrance,
   electronic effects, or the extent of positive charge density (e.g.,
   dcSTX). The positive effect of the resin in accelerating PST clearance
   from live mussels (Mytilus edulis) is not evident when compared to
   resin-free clearance; nevertheless, relevant information could be
   gathered that will facilitate further in vivo studies. Several factors
   appear to be at play, namely the competition of natural substances
   (e.g., salts, organic matter) for the same binding sites, the blocking
   of pores due to interactions between molecules, and/or difficulties in
   resin absorption by mussels. Additionally, the present work revealed the
   ability of mussels to neutralize pH and proposes bioconversion reactions
   among the PST molecules.},

Title = {Field depuration and biotransformation of paralytic shellfish toxins in

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Under laboratory conditions, the scallop Chlamys nobilis and the mussel
   Perna viridis were exposed to N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C2 toxin), a
   paralytic shellfish toxin (PST), by feeding a local toxic strain of the
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (ATDP) that produced C2 toxin
   exclusively. The bivalves were subsequently depurated in the field, and
   their depuration kinetics, biotransformation and toxin distribution were
   quantified. Depuration was characterized by a rapid loss within the
   first day, followed by a secondary slower loss of toxins. In the fast
   depuration phase, scallops detoxified PSTs more quickly than the mussels
   (depuration rate constants for scallops and mussels were 1.16 day(-1)
   and 0.87 day(-1), respectively). In contrast, the mussels detoxified
   PSTs more quickly than the scallops in the slow depuration phase, and
   the calculated depuration rate constants (mean+SE) from day 2 to day 13
   were 0.063+0.009 day(-1) and 0.040+0.019 day(-1) for mussels and
   scallops, respectively. The differences in the appearances of
   gonyautoxins, GTX2 and GTX3, and their decarbamoyl derivatives, dcGTX2,
   dcGTX3 and GTX5, which are all derivatives of C2 toxin, indicated active
   and species-specific biotransformation of the algal toxins in the two
   bivalves. In both species of bivalves, the non-viscera tissue contained
   fewer toxins and lower concentrations than the viscera-containing tissue
   compartment. In scallops, very little toxin was distributed in the
   adductor muscle. In mussels, most of the PSTs were found in the
   digestive gland with significant transport of toxins into the digestive
   gland from other tissues during the course of depuration. The toxin
   profiles of scallops and mussels differed from each other and from that
   of the toxic algae fed. A significant fraction of GTX5 was detected in
   the mussels but not in the scallops. Our study demonstrates a species
   specificity in the depuration kinetics, biotransformation and tissue
   distribution of PSTs among different bivalves.},

Title = {Analysis of the importance of lipid breakdown for elimination of okadaic
   acid (diarrhetic shellfish toxin) in mussels, Mytilus edulis::
   results from a field study and a laboratory experiment},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2004},

Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA) is a lipophilic phycotoxin, which accumulates in the
   digestive organs of mussels and may cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning
   (DSP) in humans. Depuration of toxic mussels is a potential option for
   the shellfish industry to increase the availability of marketable
   mussels. To develop cost-effective deputation methods for DSP toxins,
   knowledge about the environmental conditions and physiological processes
   regulating the rate of depuration is essential. In this paper, the
   importance of lipid breakdown for elimination of OA in mussels was
   investigated by performing a field study and a manipulative laboratory
   experiment. First, total lipid content and concurrent concentration of
   OA in the digestive glands of farmed blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was
   analysed on a monthly basis from January to June 2000. A significant
   positive correlation between levels of OA and lipid content was observed
   between January and March, when lipid levels were showing a decreasing
   trend. This supported a previously proposed model that breakdown of
   lipid stores may affect the release and elimination of this lipophilic
   toxin. To test this causal model, a laboratory experiment was performed.
   Mussels containing OA were exposed to experimental treatments (increased
   seawater temperature and/or food limitation) for 24 days in order to
   increase the energy requirements and need to use lipids as an energy
   source. It was predicted that mussels exposed to these treatments would
   have a faster elimination rate of OA compared to feeding mussels kept in
   ambient seawater temperature. The results showed that lipid content was
   significantly reduced in mussels exposed to an increased water
   temperature (24 degreesC) compared to ambient temperature (18 degreesC).
   The amount of lipids was not affected by food limitation. Although lipid
   content was-reduced in 24 degreesC, the rate of depuration of OA was not
   faster for mussels in this treatment and no correlation was detected
   between lipid content and, OA. Depuration rates were very similar for
   all treatments and followed an exponential decrease relationship (t(1/2)
   = 8 days). Thus, the proposed model that lipid breakdown affects the
   mechanism of elimination of OA was not supported. Nevertheless, the
   observed rates of depuration provide useful information and a potential
   predictive too] for large-scale depuration methods of mussels. The
   difficulties to influence the rate of depuration of this toxin by
   changing the environmental conditions suggest that processes,
   insensitive to short-term manipulation of the external environment,
   regulate depuration of OA. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Paralytic shellfish toxin uptake, tissue distribution, and depuration in
   the Southern Rock Lobster Jasus edwardsii Hutton},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Up to 13.6 mg STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1) of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST)
   have been found in the hepatopancreas of Southern Rock Lobster, Jasus
   edwardsii, on the east coast of Tasmania. Blooms of the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella have been reported in this region
   since 2012. Experimental work was undertaken to improve the
   understanding of the uptake and depuration mechanisms involved. Adult
   male lobsters were fed highly toxic mussels (6 mg STX.2HCl equiv.
   kg(-1)) sourced from the impacted area. The apparent feed intake of the
   lobster was positively correlated to increasing PST levels in the
   hepatopancreas. Toxins accumulated rapidly in the hepatopancreas
   reaching a maximum of 9.0 mg STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1), then depurated at a
   rate of 7\% per day once toxic fed was removed. However, PST were not
   detected at significant levels in the haemolymph of these animals.
   Notable increases occurred in the relative amount of several PST
   analogues in the hepatopancreas, including GTX2\&3, C1\&2 and several
   decarbomoyl toxins in comparison to the profile observed in contaminated
   mussel feed. The concentration of PST in lobster antennal glands was two
   orders of magnitude lower than concentrations found in the
   hepatopancreas. This is the first report of PST in lobster antennal
   glands which, along with the gills, represent possible excretion routes
   for PST. Implications for biotoxin risk monitoring are: lobsters will
   continue to feed during bloom periods and high concentrations of PST can
   occur; animal collection should be frequent at the start of a bloom in
   case of a rapid accumulation of PST; and non-lethal sampling is not
   possible as haemolymph PST levels do not reflect what is in the
   hepatopancreas.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {103},

Abstract = {Surfclams, Spisula solidissima, pose a particular health risk for human
   consumption as they are characterized by accumulation of extremely high
   levels of toxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP),
   slow toxin elimination and an extremely high post-ingestive capacity for
   toxin bioconversion. Surfclam populations experience a wide range of
   temperatures along the NW Atlantic continental shelf, and are undergoing
   range contraction that has been attributed to global warming. In this
   study the influence of temperature (5, 12 and 21 degrees C) on
   detoxification kinetics of individual PSP toxins in two tissue
   compartments of juvenile surfclams (similar to 35 mm shell length) was
   determined under controlled laboratory conditions, over prolonged (2.4
   months) depuration. Clams were toxified with a representative regional
   Gulf of Maine isolate of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense of
   known toxin profile, allowing tracking of changes in toxin composition
   and calculated toxicity in surfclam tissues. The visceral mass
   detoxified at all temperatures, although toxin loss rate increased with
   increasing temperature. In contrast, total toxin content and calculated
   toxicities in other tissues remained constant or even increased during
   depuration, suggesting a physiological or biochemical toxin-retention
   mechanism in this tissue pool and temperature-independent
   detoxification. In vivo toxin compositional changes in surfclam tissues
   found in this study provide evidence of specific toxin conversion
   pathways, involving both reductive and decarbamoylation pathways. We
   conclude that such toxin biotransformations, especially in non-visceral
   tissues, may introduce a discrepancy in describing kinetics of total
   toxicity (in saxitoxin equivalents {[}STXeq]) of S. solidissima over
   prolonged detoxification. Nevertheless, use of total toxicity values
   generated by routine regulatory monitoring based upon mouse bioassays or
   calculated from chemical analytical determination of molar toxin
   concentrations is adequate for first-order modeling of toxin kinetics in
   this species. Furthermore, the differential detoxification response of
   viscera and other tissues in relation to temperature emphasizes the need
   for two-compartment modeling to describe the fate of PSP toxins in this
   species. Finally, key parameters were identified that may prove useful
   in hindcasting the timing of toxic blooms or new toxin input in deep
   offshore waters where routine monitoring of toxic phytoplankton is
   impractical. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of natural toxic
   substances often found in marine bivalves. Accumulation, anatomical
   distribution, biotransformation and depuration of PSTs in different
   tissues of bivalves, however, are still not very well understood. In
   this study, we investigated biokinetics and biotransformation of PSTs in
   six different tissues, namely gill, mantle, gonad, adductor muscle,
   kidney, and digestive gland, in Yesso scallops Patinopecten yessoensis
   exposed to a toxic strain of dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum. High
   daily accumulation rate (DAR) was recorded at the beginning stage of the
   experiment. Most of the PSTs in toxic algae ingested by scallops were
   retained and the toxicity level of PSTs in scallops exceeded the
   regulatory limit within 5 days. At the late stage of the experiment,
   however, DAR decreased obviously due to the removal of PSTs. Fitting
   results of the biokinetics model indicated that the amount of PSTs
   transferred from digestive gland to mantle, adductor muscle, gonad,
   kidney, and gill in a decreasing order, and adductor muscle, kidney, and
   gonad had higher removal rate than gill and mantle. Toxin profile in
   digestive gland was dominated by N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins 1/2 (C1/2),
   closely resembled that of the toxic algae. In contrast, toxin components
   in kidney were dominated by high- potency neosaxitoxin (NEO) and
   saxitoxin (STX), suggesting that the kidney be a major organ for
   transformation of PSTs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The first survey of the phycotoxin profile in mussels (Mytilus
   galloprovincialis) from the coastal waters of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   (The Bay of Neum, Middle Adriatic Sea) in correlation to the Makarska
   City Bay (Croatia, Middle Adriatic Sea) was conducted in 2017.
   Throughout the monitoring period, occasions of gymnodimine (GYM) and
   azaspiracid (AZA2) shellfish toxicity were recorded in concentrations
   that do not endanger human health. The occurrence of yessotoxins (YTXs),
   the most common toxins found in the Adriatic Sea, was correlated to the
   presence of the Gonyaulax species, a potential source of YTX. The DSP
   group of toxins is represented by the ester-OA. Phytoplankton analysis
   confirmed the presence of dinoflagellates from the Prorocentrum genus, a
   species associated with DSP toxicity. Occurrence frequency and
   variability of toxin composition were investigated in conjunction to
   physico-chemical parameters in the surrounding sea water. In the central
   Adriatic Sea, the infestation period ranges in general from June to
   August. However, the depuration phase extended beyond September in the
   Bay of Neum, increasing the length of the decontamination period.},

Abstract = {Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a highly water-soluble cytotoxin produced by
   several species of freshwater cyanobacteria and it is considered the
   second most studied cyanotoxin worldwide. CYN acts as a potent protein
   and glutathione synthesis inhibitor, as well as inducing genotoxicity,
   oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. Studies concerning
   the depuration of cyanobacterial toxins in aquatic organisms, especially
   in fish, are of great interest for fish economy and public health, but
   are scarce in the case of CYN. This is the first study reporting the
   ability of depuration (3-7 days) in reversing or ameliorating the
   histopathological lesions induced in liver, kidney, heart, intestines,
   and gills of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) due to exposure by
   immersion to repeated doses of a CYN-containing culture of A.
   ovalisporum for 14 days. The main histopathological changes induced by
   CYN were glucogenic degeneration and loss of the normal hepatic
   cord-structure (liver), hyperemia, dilated Bowman's capsule and cellular
   tumefaction (kidney), myofibrolysis, hemorrhages and edema (heart),
   necrosis and partial loss of microvilli (gastrointestinal tract), and
   hyperemia and inflammatory cells infiltrates (gills). After 3 days of
   depuration, gills were totally recovered, while the liver, kidney, and
   gastrointestinal tract required 7 days, and longer depuration periods
   may be needed for a full recovery of the heart. In addition, the
   morphometric study indicated that depuration managed to reverse the
   affectation in the hepatocytes nuclear diameters and cross sections of
   the proximal and distal convoluted tubules induced in CYN-exposed fish.
   In general, these results validate depuration as an effective practice
   for detoxification of fish contaminated with CYN. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms are a common phenomenon in the Baltic Sea, and the
   hepatotoxin nodularin has been frequently detected in certain Baltic Sea
   fishes and mussels. However, there is no knowledge about the naturally
   occurring concentrations of nodularin in Baltic Sea zooplankton. The aim
   of this study was to survey the concentrations of nodularin in natural
   zooplankton assemblages, and to study the depuration of nodularin in one
   common copepod species, Eurytemora affinis, experimentally. The
   nodularin concentrations in common zooplankton species were determined
   from field-collected samples from the northern Baltic Proper in 2001 and
   2002, during cyanobacterial blooms, and the samples were analysed by
   ELISA immunoassay. Nodularin could be detected from the field-collected
   zooplankton, suggesting that during a natural bloom event toxins
   accumulate in their tissues. The concentrations were relatively low
   (0.07 +/- 0.01 mu g g(-1) ww), ranging from below detection limit to
   0.62 mu g g(-1) ww. Some variation occurred in the concentrations
   between species and years; generally concentrations were higher in 2001
   than in 2002. In the depuration experiment E. affinis copepods were fed
   with toxic Nodularia spumigena for 24 h, and their toxin contents were
   monitored for 24 h after transferring them to filtered seawater. A rapid
   decrease in nodularin concentrations occurred during the first 0.5-3 h
   after the exposure. However, after a 24-h depuration period in filtered
   seawater, nodularin could be still detected in E. affinis tissues,
   indicating that part of the accumulated nodularin, or its derivatives,
   could be transferred to planktivores.},

Abstract = {Concentrations of the paralytic shellfish toxins C1+2, C3+4, GTX5, GTX6,
   dcGTX2+3, dcSTX, dcNEO, GTX2+3, GTX1+4, STX and NEO were determined by
   LC-FLD in composite samples of digestive glands and gills of
   Cerastoderma edule cockle. The specimens were sampled in Aveiro lagoon,
   Portugal, under natural depuration conditions (days 0, 8, 12, 14, 19, 21
   and 25) after exposure to a bloom of Gymnodinium catenatum. Individual
   paralytic shellfish toxins indicated different pathways of elimination
   and biotransformation in digestive gland and gills. Toxin concentrations
   in gills were lower than in digestive gland. Most of the quantified
   toxins in digestive gland decreased during the 25 days of observation
   according to negative exponential curves, and only GTX5, GTX6 and NEO
   showed slight irregularities with time. Concentrations of C1+2, C3+4 and
   dcGTX2+3 in gills decreased progressively, however GTX5, GTX6 and dcSTX
   showed pronounced increases. Higher concentrations of those toxins in
   days 8 and 12 in comparison to the initial value (day 0) indicate
   conversion of other toxins into GTX5, GTX6 and dcSTX during those
   periods. It appears that inter-conversion of toxins occurs as G.
   catenatum cells are retained in gills before being transferred to other

Abstract = {Bivalves (e.g., clams, oysters, mussels, scallops) are a significant
   part of the global diet and are harvested for their nutritional value,
   but as filter feeders they are susceptible to the accumulation of toxins
   produced by certain species of phytoplankton. Karlotoxins (KmTxs) are a
   class of amphidinol-like compounds with hemolytic, ichthyotoxic, and
   cytotoxic properties that have been associated with harmful algal
   blooms, and the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum uses KmTxs to
   facilitate prey capture and deter grazing by other organisms. In this
   work, we examined the accumulation and depuration of 4,5-dihydro-KmTx2,
   a karlotoxin previously isolated from K. veneficum, in two bivalves with
   different life habits, i.e., Sinonovacula constricta Lamarck and
   Mercenaria mercenaria Linnaeus. After both bivalves received K.
   veneficum GM5 in their feed for a long period of 10 days,
   4,5dihydro-KmTx2 was accumulated considerably in the visceral mass, but
   there was almost no toxin accumulation in the muscle. The accumulation
   was more severe for M. mercenaria than S. constricta. The toxin was
   cleared almost completely from the bivalves 5 days after K. veneficum
   GM5 was removed from the feed. For both bivalves, the bait microalgae I.
   galbana slowed both the accumulation and the depuration of the toxin.},

Title = {Paralytic Shellfish Toxins and Ocean Warming: Bioaccumulation and
   Ecotoxicological Responses in Juvenile Gilthead Seabream (Sparus
   aurata)},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Warmer seawater temperatures are expected to increase harmful algal
   blooms (HABs) occurrence, intensity, and distribution. Yet, the
   potential interactions between abiotic stressors and HABs are still
   poorly understood from ecological and seafood safety perspectives. The
   present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the
   bioaccumulation/depuration mechanisms and ecotoxicological responses of
   juvenile gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) exposed to paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PST) under different temperatures (18, 21, 24 degrees
   C). PST were detected in fish at the peak of the exposure period (day
   five, 0.22 mu g g(-1) N-sulfocarbamoylGonyautoxin-1-2 (C1 and C2), 0.08
   mu g g(-1) Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and 0.18 mu g g(-1)
   Gonyautoxin-5 (B1)), being rapidly eliminated (within the first 24 h of
   depuration), regardless of exposure temperature. Increased temperatures
   led to significantly higher PST contamination (275 mu g STX eq. kg(-1)).
   During the trial, fish antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide
   dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; glutathione S-transferase, GST) in both
   muscle and viscera were affected by temperature, whereas a significant
   induction of heat shock proteins (HSP70), Ubiquitin (Ub) activity
   (viscera), and lipid peroxidation (LPO; muscle) was observed under the
   combination of warming and PST exposure. The differential
   bioaccumulation and biomarker responses observed highlight the need to
   further understand the interactive effects between PST and abiotic
   stressors, to better estimate climate change impacts on HABs events, and
   to develop mitigation strategies to overcome the potential risks
   associated with seafood consumption.},

Title = {Field Validation of the Southern Rock Lobster Paralytic Shellfish Toxin
   Monitoring Program in Tasmania, Australia},
Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) are found in the hepatopancreas of
   Southern Rock Lobster Jasus edwardsii from the east coast of Tasmania in
   association with blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium
   catenella. Tasmania's rock lobster fishery is one of the state's most
   important wild capture fisheries, supporting a significant commercial
   industry (AUD 97M) and recreational fishing sector. A comprehensive 8
   years of field data collected across multiple sites has allowed
   continued improvements to the risk management program protecting public
   health and market access for the Tasmanian lobster fishery. High
   variability was seen in toxin levels between individuals, sites, months,
   and years. The highest risk sites were those on the central east coast,
   with July to January identified as the most at-risk months. Relatively
   high uptake rates were observed (exponential rate of 2\% per day),
   similar to filter-feeding mussels, and meant that lobster accumulated
   toxins quickly. Similarly, lobsters were relatively fast detoxifiers,
   losing up to 3\% PST per day, following bloom demise. Mussel sentinel
   lines were effective in indicating a risk of elevated PST in lobster
   hepatopancreas, with annual baseline monitoring costing approximately
   0.06\% of the industry value. In addition, it was determined that if the
   mean hepatopancreas PST levels in five individual lobsters from a site
   were <0.22 mg STX equiv. kg(-1), there is a 97.5\% probability that any
   lobster from that site would be below the bivalve maximum level of 0.8
   mg STX equiv. kg(-1). The combination of using a sentinel species to
   identify risk areas and sampling five individual lobsters at a
   particular site, provides a cost-effective strategy for managing PST
   risk in the Tasmanian commercial lobster fishery.},

Abstract = {Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) constitute one of the most important sources
   of contamination in the oceans, producing high concentrations of
   potentially harmful biotoxins that are accumulated across the food
   chains. One such biotoxin, Okadaic Acid (OA), is produced by marine
   dinoflagellates and subsequently accumulated within the tissues of
   filtering marine organisms feeding on HABs, rapidly spreading to their
   predators in the food chain and eventually reaching human consumers
   causing Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) syndrome. While numerous
   studies have thoroughly evaluated the effects of OA in mammals, the
   attention drawn to marine organisms in this regard has been scarce, even
   though they constitute primary targets for this biotoxin. With this in
   mind, the present work aimed to provide a timely and comprehensive
   insight into the current literature on the effect of OA in marine
   invertebrates, along with the strategies developed by these organisms to
   respond to its toxic effect together with the most important methods and
   techniques used for OA detection and evaluation.},

   a batch of contaminated mussels was transplanted to several
   uncontaminated sites having different environmental conditions. The
   depuration kinetics of okadaic acid (the dominant toxin involved in the
   episode) in each experimental mussel batch was monitored during a 70 d
   period, as were the corresponding salinity, temperature, fluorescence,
   light transmission and mussel body weight. Environmental conditions and
   body weight were shown to have an effect on depuration rates by
   principal component and multiple regression analysis. Although most of
   the variables studied showed a high degree of covariation, fluorescence
   and Light transmission, which serve to measure the availability of
   solids and phytoplankton for mussels, appeared to have the most
   prominent effect on depuration. Four different models were tested in
   order to describe depuration kinetics: 1- and 2-compartment models, each
   in 2 versions, with and without the inclusion of the effects of the 4
   environmental variables studied and body weight. The 1-compartment model
   without the complementary variables did not give an appropriate
   description of the kinetics, but when these variables were included, the
   general fitting was good and a pattern was found in the most important
   deviations. The simplest of the 2-compartment models fitted also
   produced an output that adequately described the kinetics observed.
   However, attempts to estimate the parameters of 2-compartment models
   including the complementary variables consistently produced a
   1-compartment model. The model chosen to describe depuration kinetics
   substantially influences the estimation of the effect of the
   environmental variables.},

   for human and aquatic health},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {59-66},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The occurrence of freshwater harmful algal bloom toxins impacting the
   coastal ocean is an emerging threat, and the potential for invertebrate
   prey items to concentrate toxin and cause harm to human and wildlife
   consumers is not yet fully recognized. We examined toxin uptake and
   release in marine mussels for both particulate and dissolved phases of
   the hepatotoxin microcystin, produced by the freshwater cyanobacterial
   genus Microcystis. We also extended our experimental investigation of
   particulate toxin to include oysters (Crassostrea sp.) grown
   commercially for aquaculture. California mussels (Mytilus californianus)
   and oysters were exposed to Microcystis and microcystin toxin for 24 h
   at varying concentrations, and then were placed in constantly flowing
   seawater and sampled through time simulating riverine flushing events to
   the coastal ocean. Mussels exposed to particulate microcystin purged the
   toxin slowly, with toxin detectable for at least 8 weeks post-exposure
   and maximum toxin of 39.11 ng/g after exposure to 26.65 mu g/L
   microcystins. Dissolved toxin was also taken up by California mussels,
   with maximum concentrations of 20.74 ng/g after exposure to 7.74 mu g/L
   microcystin, but was purged more rapidly. Oysters also took up
   particulate toxin but purged it more quickly than mussels. Additionally,
   naturally occurring marine mussels collected from San Francisco Bay
   tested positive for high levels of microcystin toxin. These results
   suggest that ephemeral discharge of Microcystis or microcystin to
   estuaries and the coastal ocean accumulate in higher trophic levels for
   weeks to months following exposure. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Effects of Vibrio vulnificus and Microcystis aeruginosa co-exposures on
   microplastic accumulation and depuration in the Eastern Oyster
   (Crassostrea virginica)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {359},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, and bivalves
   such as the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) can accumulate these
   particles directly from the water column. Bivalves are concurrently
   exposed to pathogenic and toxin-producing bacteria, including Vibrio
   spp. and Microcystis spp., which have been shown to adversely impact
   filtration rates. Exposure to these bacteria could thus affect oysters'
   ability to accumulate and depurate microplastics. As climate change
   creates conditions that favor Vibrio spp. and Microcystis spp. growth in
   estuaries, it is increasingly important to understand how these
   co-occurring biotic stressors influence microplastic contamination in
   bivalves. The objective of this study was to examine how co-exposures to
   Vibrio vulnificus and Microcystis aeruginosa influence microplastic
   accumulation and depuration in Eastern oysters. Oysters were exposed to
   nylon microplastics (5000 particles L- 1) and either V. vulnificus, M.
   aeruginosa, or both species (104 colony-forming units or cells mL- 1,
   respectively) and sampled over time up to 96 h. Following exposure,
   remaining oysters were allowed to depurate in clean seawater and sampled
   over time for up to 96 h. Microplastic concentrations in oysters were
   quantified and compared among treatments, and rate constants for uptake
   (ku) and depuration (kd) were calculated using nonlinear regression and
   two-compartment kinetic models. Overall, microplastic concentrations in
   oysters exposed to V. vulnificus (X = 2.885 f 0.350 (SE) particles g- 1
   w.w.) and V. vulnificus with M. aeruginosa (X = 3.089 f 0.481 particles
   g- 1 w.w.) were higher than oysters exposed to M. aeruginosa (X = 1.540
   f 0.235 particles g- 1 w.w.) and to microplastics alone (X = 1.599 f
   0.208 particles g- 1 w.w.). Characterizing microplastic accumulation and
   depuration in oysters co-exposed to these biotic stressors is an
   important first step in understanding how contaminant loads in bivalves
   can change. With this research, the efficacy of depuration for
   commonly-consumed seafood species can be estimated.},

Title = {Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST)-Transforming Enzymes: A Review},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of toxins that cause
   paralytic shellfish poisoning through blockage of voltage-gated sodium
   channels. PSTs are produced by prokaryotic freshwater cyanobacteria and
   eukaryotic marine dinoflagellates. Proliferation of toxic algae species
   can lead to harmful algal blooms, during which seafood accumulate high
   levels of PSTs, posing a health threat to consumers. The existence of
   PST-transforming enzymes was first remarked due to the divergence of PST
   profiles and concentrations between contaminated bivalves and toxigenic
   organisms. Later, several enzymes involved in PST transformation,
   synthesis and elimination have been identified. The knowledge of
   PST-transforming enzymes is necessary for understanding the processes of
   toxin accumulation and depuration in mollusk bivalves. Furthermore,
   PST-transforming enzymes facilitate the obtainment of pure analogues of
   toxins as in natural sources they are present in a mixture. Pure
   compounds are of interest for the development of drug candidates and as
   analytical reference materials. PST-transforming enzymes can also be
   employed for the development of analytical tools for toxin detection.
   This review summarizes the PST-transforming enzymes identified so far in
   living organisms from bacteria to humans, with special emphasis on
   bivalves, cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, and discusses enzymes'
   biological functions and potential practical applications.},

Title = {Experimental Evidence of Ciguatoxin Accumulation and Depuration in
   Carnivorous Lionfish},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ciguatera poisoning is a food intoxication associated with the
   consumption of fish or shellfish contaminated, through trophic transfer,
   with ciguatoxins (CTXs). In this study, we developed an experimental
   model to assess the trophic transfer of CTXs from herbivorous
   parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos, to carnivorous lionfish, Pterois
   volitans. During a 6-week period, juvenile lionfish were fed naturally
   contaminated parrotfish fillets at a daily dose of 0.11 or 0.035 ng
   CTX3C equiv. g(-1), as measured by the radioligand-receptor binding
   assay (r-RBA) or neuroblastoma cell-based assay (CBA-N2a), respectively.
   During an additional 6-week depuration period, the remaining fish were
   fed a CTX-free diet. Using r-RBA, no CTXs were detectable in muscular
   tissues, whereas CTXs were measured in the livers of two out of nine
   fish sampled during exposure, and in four out of eight fish sampled
   during depuration. Timepoint pooled liver samples, as analyzed by
   CBA-N2a, confirmed the accumulation of CTXs in liver tissues, reaching
   0.89 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) after 41 days of exposure, followed by slow
   toxin elimination, with 0.37 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) measured after the
   6-week depuration. These preliminary results, which need to be pursued
   in adult lionfish, strengthen our knowledge on CTX transfer and kinetics
   along the food web.},

Abstract = {The influence of nutritional regime and water temperature on depuration
   rates of OA-group toxins in the wedge shell Donax trunculus was examined
   by exposing naturally contaminated specimens to three nutritional
   regimes (microalgae, commercial paste of microalgae, and starvation) for
   14 days at 16 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Total OA was quantified in the
   whole soft tissues of the individuals collected in days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
   12 and 14. Mortality, dry weight, condition index, gross biochemical
   composition and gametogenic stages were surveyed. Low variation of
   glycogen and carbohydrates during the experiments suggest that wedge
   shells were under non-dramatic stress conditions. Wedge shells fed with
   non-toxic diets showed similar depuration rates being 15 and 38\% higher
   than in starvation, at 16 and 20 degrees C, respectively. Depuration
   rates under non-toxic diets at 20 degrees C were 71\% higher than at 16
   degrees C. These results highlight the influence of water temperature on
   the depuration rate of total OA accumulated by D. trunculus, even when
   the increase is of only 4 degrees C, as commonly observed in week time
   scales in the southern Portuguese coastal waters. These results open the
   possibility of a faster release of OA in harvested wedge shells
   translocated to depuration systems when under a slight increase of water
   temperature. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Does uptake of Alexandrium fundyense cysts contribute to the
   levels of PSP toxin found in the sea scallop, Placopecten
   magellanicus?},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},

Abstract = {Atlantic sea scallops, Placopecten magellanicus, in most areas of the
   Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada, have year-round concentrations of
   paralytic shellfish posioning (PSP) toxins greater than the regulatory
   concentration of 80 mug STXeq. 100g(-1) wetweight. Scallops (mean shell
   height of 10.7cm, age 3-5 years) were collected by SCUBA and
   individually tagged near Parker Island, Bay of Fundy. Half were hung 2
   in below the low tide water level and the remainder were placed on the
   bottom (11 m depth at low tide) under the scallops held at 2 in.
   Scallop, water and sediment samples were collected monthly for
   determination of concentrations of PSP toxins and Alexandrium fundyense.
   In October, 1993, mean concentrations of PSP toxins in digestive gland,
   and mantle were 3205 and 1018 mug STX eq. 100 g(-1) wet weight,
   respectively. Eight months later (June 1994), PSP concentrations in
   digestive glands from the surface and bottom had declined to 504 and 682
   mug STX eq. 100 g(-1) wet weight, respectively, whereas those in the
   mantle had declined to 802 and 681 mug STX eq. 100 g(-1) wet weight.
   During July 1994, A. fundyense concentrations observed at Parker Island
   and offshore were 320 cells l(-1) and 14,200 cells l(-1), respectively.
   Subsequently, toxin concentrations in surface and bottom scallop
   digestive glands increased to 12,720 and 11,408 mug STX eq. 100 g(-1)
   wet weight, whereas concentrations in mantles increased to 2126 and 1748
   mug STX eq. 100 g(-1) wet weight, respectively. Concentrations of PSP
   toxins in these tissues in October 1994 were similar to those measured
   in October 1993. Concentrations of PSP toxin were less than the
   regulatory concentration in the gonads and non-detectable in adductor
   muscles of all scallops sampled.
   There were no statistically significant differences in profiles for
   uptake and depuration of PSP toxins in scallops held at the surface
   compared to those from bottom, suggesting that A. fundyense cysts at the
   concentrations found in the sediment (45 cysts cm(-3)) did not
   contribute significantly to the year-round presence of PSP toxins within
   scallop tissues. The year-round occurrence of PSP toxin is probably due
   to accumulation during summer blooms followed by a very slow rate of
   depuration. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V

Title = {Transformation and Depuration o f Paralytic Shellfish Toxins in the
   Geoduck Clam Panopea globosa From the Northern Gulf of California},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {In January 2015, a harmful algae bloom (HAB) of the dinoflagellate
   Gymnodinium catenatum occurred in the Northern Gulf of California (NGC).
   This species produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), a group of
   potent neurotoxins. The harvesting and commercialization of geoduck
   Panopea globose are important economic activities in this region and
   were prohibited for several months due to the accumulation of PSTs in
   clam tissues. We analyzed PSTs concentrations in P globose collected on
   a weekly basis during 2015 near San Felipe, Baja California. The aim of
   the study was to evaluate the transformation and depuration
   characteristics of PSTs in different geoduck tissues. The PST content
   was evaluated in the visceral mass and in the siphon by high-performance
   liquid chromatography with post-column oxidation (HPLCPCOX).
   Additionally, 10 selected samples were analyzed by hydrophilic
   interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
   (HILIC-MS/MS). Toxicity in all siphon samples was lower than the
   regulatory limit (RL) for PSTs of 800 mu g STX eq kg(-1) . In contrast,
   the maximum toxicity of 16,740 mu g STX eq kg(-1) detected in the
   visceral mass exceeded 21 times the RL and it took 210 days to reach
   values below 800 mu g STX eq kg(-1) . Therefore, P globose can be
   considered a slow detoxifier bivalve with a depuration rate of 4.3\%
   day(-1) (calculated by an exponential decay model; R-2 = 0.80). The
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins Cl and 2 were the most abundant analogs in the
   siphon and viscera samples collected close to the HAB occurrence. The
   concentration of these analogs decreased and GTX5 and more toxic analogs
   such as dcGTX2 and dcSTX were detected. M-type analogs were detected by
   HIUC-MS/MS and represented up to 75\% of total PSTs in some samples.
   M-type analogs contributed to 48\% of toxicity estimated in the sample.
   We report for the first time the depuration rate, PSTs profile, and its
   change over time in P globlosa. This information is essential to
   characterize the metabolism of toxins in this economically important
   bivalve but also to develop management plans for fisheries if the
   organism is going to be recurrently exposed to PSTs producing blooms, as
   seems the case for the NGC.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) were detected in abalone (Haliotis
   rubra) in April 2011 in south-east Tasmania, Australia, during a
   dinoflagellate bloom of Gymnodinium catenatum. This led to restrictions
   on abalone harvesting and triggered continued PST monitoring by Ultra
   Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-FLD) of abalone and mussels
   (Mytilus galloprovincialis), and concurrent phytoplankton monitoring,
   between 2011 and 2013. PST up to 2437 lig STX mu q kg(-1) (three times
   the bivalve regulatory limit) were confirmed in abalone viscera, with
   toxicity up to 586 pg STX mu q kg(-1) in the muscular foot (mainly doSTX
   and minor proportions of SIX and doSTX). Mussels accumulated PST at a
   faster rate than abalone which suggests they can serve as sentinels of
   PST accumulation to inform abalone risk management protocols.
   Three lines of evidence for G. catenatum as the source of PST in abalone
   were established: (1) PST in abalone tissues increased and declined in
   association with dinoflagellate blooms; (2) G. catenatum DNA was
   detected by real-time PCR in abalone digestive tracts; and (3) the PST
   analogues (toxin profile) observed in both abalone viscera and mussels
   were similar suggesting a common PST source. This is the first time a
   conclusive linkage between the occurrence of PST in abalone and a
   dinoflagellate source has been demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Adult scallops, Patinopecten yessoensis, held for 8 d separately in
   tanks and fed known amounts of cultured cells of the dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium tamarense were held without feeding for an additional 10 d.
   During the 18 d study, 3 scallops were removed every 2 d and the
   quantity of of each toxin present was analyzed individually, The toxins
   released into the environmental seawater were recovered and also
   analyzed. These experiments showed that the individual variation in
   bivalve toxicity often observed in feeding experiments and field surveys
   is due to differences in the amounts of dinoflagellate cells ingested by
   the bivalves and that a portion of the total amount of toxins
   accumulated in the scallop is released into the environmental water.
   However, the sum of the amount of toxins in the scallop and that
   released into the water cannot be explained in terms of the amount
   supplied by A. tamarense, suggesting that in addition to toxin
   accumulation from the food chain, another unknown mechanism is involved
   in toxin accumulation in the scallop. The toxins incorporated into the
   scallop from A. tamarense are considered to undergo metabolism in the
   scallop through which the toxins are changed to derivatives undetectable
   by HPLC.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Pages = {1-7},

Abstract = {Economic bivalve ingested toxic algae causes frequent human poisoning
   events. To explore new compounds that can accelerate the depuration of
   toxins in shellfish, we investigated the detoxification of the paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) and the biotransformation pathway of PSTs during
   detoxification by the application of three treatments to a toxic bloom,
   Alexandrium minutum (A. minutum). The detoxification effect of
   Platymonas sub-cordiformis (PS) mixed with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)
   group is significantly better than the starving group in each oyster
   tissues. The toxicity of viscera which occupied 78.95\% of total
   toxicity reduced to 155 MU/100g after 13 days' depuration experiment.
   And adding CMC could significantly achieve rapid detoxification and

Title = {Environmental factors driving microcystin contamination of estuarine
   bivalve populations downstream of freshwater cyanobacterial blooms},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {214},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Estuaries are dynamic environments that provide vital habitat to
   ecologically and commercially important bivalves. In some cases,
   freshwater tributaries can introduce cyanobacteria and associated
   cyanotoxins into estuaries that may subsequently accumulate in estuarine
   bivalves. Temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs), which only
   experience tidal input for limited periods of time, may be particularly
   vulnerable to the accumulation of cyanotoxins in bivalves as they can be
   subject to freshwater input without tidal flushing and may experience
   lower salinities and cyanobacterial blooms. This study quantified levels
   of microcystin in bivalves collected as a time series over a five-year
   period (2017-2021) from Mecox Bay, a TOCE on Long Island, NY, USA, that
   hosts a productive oyster fishery and is downstream of a freshwater body
   that hosts microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms. During the
   study, microcystin was detected in all bivalves monitored including
   Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis),
   and soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria), with levels in oysters exceeding
   those in other species and frequently exceeding 10 ng g(-1), the
   California regulatory action level for microcystin in tissue. While
   oysters were capable of depurating 60-90 \% of microcystin after
   four-to-six weeks during summer, microcystin loads in bivalves often
   peaked in cooler months after water column cyanobacteria and microcystin
   levels had seasonally declined, suggesting toxin depuration slowed at
   colder temperatures. Multiple linear regression models established that
   time-integrated measurements of pelagic microcystin concentrations in
   freshwater and estuarine locations, water temperature (inverse
   correlation), and salinity had highly significant (r(2) = 0.71; p <
   0.001) predictive power of the microcystin content in oysters. These
   findings demonstrate that bivalves, particularly oysters, in TOCEs
   located downstream of microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms are
   vulnerable to microcystin contamination, especially during fall months
   when temperature-dependent toxin depuration rates are likely slow.},

Abstract = {Industrial depuration may provide a means of removing domoic acid toxin
   from blue mussels (Mytilus edulis).  Mussels containing up to 50-mu-g
   domoic acid.g-1 were transported from a Prince Edward Island estuary
   into controlled laboratory conditions to test the effects of
   temperature, salinity, mussel size, and feeding upon depuration.  Fifty
   percent of toxin was eliminated within 24 h.  After 72 h, mussels were
   either clean or contained, on average, only residual levels of toxin (<
   5-mu-g.g-1), regardless of conditions.  Exponential depuration curves
   were fitted to the domoic acid concentration data.  To evaluate
   differences in rate of depuration under various conditions, statistical
   comparisons were made between slopes of the clearance curves.  Rates of
   depuration were faster in small (45-55 mm) than in large mussels (60-70
   mm) and more rapid at 11 than at 6-degrees-C.  There was no significant
   difference in depuration rate at 18 parts-per-thousand salinity as
   opposed to 28 parts-per-thousand or in starved versus fed mussels. 
   Because of their relatively large digestive glands, meats of small
   mussels contained more toxin per unit weight than meats of large
   mussels.  The bulk of domoic acid appeared to reside in the gut lumen. 
   However, the presence of small amounts of domoic acid in intracellular
   compartments cannot be ruled out.},

Title = {Domoic acid uptake and elimination kinetics in oysters and mussels in
   relation to body size and anatomical distribution of toxin},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {100},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-29},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Toxin accumulation by suspension-feeding qualifier depends on a balance
   between processes regulating toxin uptake (i.e. ingestion and absorption
   of toxic cells) and elimination (i.e. egestion, exchange among tissues,
   excretion, degradation and/or biotransformation) during exposure to
   toxic blooms. This laboratory study compares the size-specific uptake
   and elimination kinetics of domoic acid (DA) from Pseudo-nitzschia
   multiseries in two co-occurring bivalves, the oyster Crassostrea
   virginica and the mussel Mytilus edulis. Domoic acid concentrations were
   measured in visceral and non-visceral tissues of different-sized oysters
   and mussels during simultaneous long-term exposure to toxic P.
   multiseries cells in the laboratory, followed by depuration on a
   non-toxic algal diet. Mussels attained 7-17-fold higher DA
   concentrations than oysters, depending on the body size and exposure
   time, and also detoxified DA at higher rates (1.4-1.6 d(-1)) than
   oysters (0.25-0.88 d(-1)) of a comparable size. Small oysters attained
   markedly higher weight-specific DA concentrations (maximum = 78.6 mu g
   g(-1)) than large, market-sized individuals (<= 13 mu g g(-1)), but no
   clear relationship was found between body size and DA concentration in
   mussels (maximum = 460 mu g g(-1)). Therefore, differential DA
   accumulation by the two species was, on average, similar to 3-fold more
   pronounced for large bivalves. An inverse relationship between DA
   elimination rate and body size was established for oysters but not
   mussels. Elimination of DA was faster in viscera than in other tissues
   of both bivalves; DA exchange rate from the former to the latter was
   higher in oysters. The contribution of viscera to the total DA burden of
   mussels was consistently greater than that of other tissues during both
   uptake (>80\%) and deputation (>65\%) phases, whereas it rapidly
   decreased from 70-80\% to 30-40\% in oysters, and this occurred faster
   in smaller individuals. Residual DA concentrations (<= 0.25 mu g g(-1))
   were detected at later deputation stages (up to 14 d), mainly in viscera
   of oysters and non-visceral tissues of mussels, suggesting that a
   second, slower-detoxifying toxin compartment exists in both species.
   However, a simple exponential decay model was found to adequately
   describe DA elimination kinetics in these bivalves. The lower capacity
   for DA accumulation in oysters compared to mussels can thus only be
   explained by the former's comparatively low toxin intake rather than
   faster toxin elimination. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {784-789},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms
   that is accumulated in the highest concentrations in filter-feeding
   organisms, such as bivalve molluscs. Although DA is a water-soluble
   molecule that is rapidly cleared from most marine organisms, it appears
   that octopus may consistently contain DA in the digestive gland. To test
   this hypothesis, specimens of Octopus vulgaris were caught for DA
   analysis when Pseudo-nitzschia cells were not observed in seawater and
   DA was not detected in octopus food items, i.e. mussels. DA was
   consistently detected in each octopus specimen (n = 32) analysed and its
   concentrations varied from 1.0 to 26.6 mu g g(-1). DA sub-cellular
   distribution was evaluated in the digestive gland of six specimens in
   order to prove whether DA preferably accumulates in some cell
   compartment. DA was predominantly found (> 90\%) in the soluble fraction
   (cytosol) and to a lesser extent in the insoluble fractions (nucleic,
   mitochondrial, lysosomal, microsomal). This disposition should favour DA
   trophic transfer from prey to predators. The present study contributes
   with relevant data to the growing knowledge on the accumulation of
   marine toxins in cephalopods and on the trophic transfer of DA

Title = {Transfer of microcystin from freshwater lakes to Puget Sound, WA and

Volume = {122},

Abstract = {Many eutrophic inland freshwater lakes in the Puget Sound Washington
   region produce toxic cyanobacteria blooms annually. While such blooms in
   lakes tend to be viewed as a localized phenomenon, there is significant
   potential for downstream export of toxins to freshwater streams, and
   marine and brackish water environments. However, monitoring for
   cyanotoxins typically associated with freshwaters, such as the
   hepatotoxin, microcystin (MC) in marine receiving waters is rare. In
   2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both
   toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in
   marine shellfish, specifically mussels. Shellfish beds are extensive
   throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of
   our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellfish
   consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We confirm, for
   the first time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with
   subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated
   maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 mu g/L, up to 0.34 mu
   g/L in marine waters and 6.5 mu g/kg in mussels. Confirmatory analyses
   by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identified MC-LA as the major
   toxin. Although we found relatively low MC levels in mussels, our study
   implies that potential concern for human food safety is justified and
   warrants further investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   purpuratus. Even though this species has a high commercial importance in
   Northern Chile and Peru, the characteristics of its DA depuration are
   not known. In this work, the DA depuration was studied by means of two
   experiments: one in controlled (laboratory) and another in natural
   conditions. All organs of A. purpuratus depurated the toxin very quickly
   in both experiments. In some organs, an increase or a very small
   decrease of toxin was detected in the early depuration steps. Several
   models were used to describe this kinetics. The one that included toxin
   transfer between organs and independent depuration from each organ was
   the model that best fit the data. It seems, therefore, that the DA in
   this species is quickly transferred from the digestive gland to all
   other organs, which release it into the environment. Physiological
   differences in the two experiments have been shown to have some effect
   on the depuration from each organ but the actual reasons are still
   unknown.},

Abstract = {The benthic gastropods Bellamya aeruginosa (B. aeruginosa) is ubiquitous
   in freshwater in China and neighboring countries with great edible
   value. It has been recognized as a potential manipulator to control
   harmful algal blooms due to its filtration on algal cells. In this
   study, the control effect of B. aeruginosa on toxic and non-toxic
   Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa), and the accumulation and
   depuration of microcystins (MCs) in the snail were systematically
   explored. Results indicated that although toxic M. aeruginosa could
   protect itself via pro-ducing MCs, the introduction of B. aeruginosa
   could still effectively inhibit the algae with cell density below 1 x
   106 cells/mL. Hepatopancreas was the primary target of MCs in all
   tissues of B. aeruginosa, presenting a maximum of 3089.60 ng/g DW when
   exposed to toxic M. aeruginosa of 1.0 x 107 cells/mL. The enrichment of
   MCs in other tissues following the order of digestive tract > gonad >
   mantle > muscle. Interestingly, snail could again excrete previously
   enriched MCs when transferred to non-toxic M. aeruginosa, giving rise to
   over 80\% reduction of MCs in the body. After depuration, the estimated
   daily intake (EDI) of free MCs in intact individuals and the edible
   parts of B. aeruginosa were both lower than the tolerable daily intake
   (TDI). These results implicated that B. aeruginosa could control low
   density of M. aeruginosa in spring. Particularly, the snail could be
   perfectly safe to consume by purifying for a while after using as
   manipulator.},

Abstract = {Contamination of bivalves with yessotoxins (YTXs) has been reported
   since 1987 in several coastal environments. In our study we investigated
   the accumulation and the metabolism of YTXs in 2 bivalve species
   important to German fisheries and aquaculture. Mussels and oysters.
   Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas, were exposed to the YTX-producing
   dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum isolated from the North Sea.
   Toxin profiles from algae and bivalves were analyzed by liquid
   chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). It was evident
   that 45-hydroxy YTX (45-OH YTX), carboxy YTX (COOH YTX), and the
   putative 45-hydroxy-carboxy YTX (45-OH-COOH YTX) were the dominant YTX
   analogues in M. edulis. The oyster C. gigas displayed a different toxin
   profile. YTX, 45-OH YTX, and 45-OH-COOH YTX were also present, but COOH
   YTX was not detectable. Furthermore, 2 unidentified analogues with the
   same MS/MS transition ({[}M-H](-) > {[}M-H-SO3](-)) occurred in both
   bivalve species. Homo YTX and 45-hydroxy-homo YTX, which are regulated
   together with YTX and 45-OH YTX in 2002/225 EC were not detected. In
   general, we confirmed former field investigations on accumulation and
   metabolism of YTXs in M. edulis; however, this is the first study on
   accumulation and metabolism of YTXs in the oyster C. gigas.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The molecular pathways behind the toxicity of diarrheic shellfish toxins
   (DSTs) in bivalves have been scarcely studied. Thus, a shotgun
   proteomics approach was applied in this work to understand bivalves'
   molecular responses to the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (1.0 x 10(6)
   cells/L). Protein expression along with toxins levels were analyzed in
   the gills and digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis
   during and after exposure to this toxic strain. Results revealed an
   accumulation of OA and DTX1 only in the digestive gland with maximum
   amounts attained at the end of uptake phase (day 5; 2819.2 +/- 522.2 mu
   g OA/kg and 1107.1 +/- 267.9 mu g DTX1/kg). At the end of the depuration
   phase (day 20), 16\% and 47\% of total OA and DTX1 concentrations
   remained in the digestive gland tissues, respectively. The shotgun
   proteomic analyses yielded 3051 proteins in both organs. A total of 56
   and 54 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed in the
   digestive gland and gills, respectively. Both organs presented the same
   response dynamics along the experiment, although with tissue-specific
   features. The early response (3 days uptake) was characterized by a high
   number of DEPs, being more marked in gills, in relation to the latter
   time points (5 days uptake and depuration). Functional enrichment
   analysis revealed the up-regulation of carboxylic (GO:0046943) and
   organic acid transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0005342) pathways
   after 3 days uptake for digestive gland. Matching to these pathways are
   a group of proteins related to transmembrane transport and response to
   toxic substances and xenobiotics, namely P-glycoprotein (ABCB11),
   Sodium-dependent proline transporter (SLC6A7), and Sideroflexin-1
   (SFXN1). According to Clusters of Orthologous Groups (GOs) categories,
   most of the DEPs found for digestive gland in all time-points were
   related with ``cellular processes and signaling{''} and involving signal
   transduction mechanisms, cytoskeleton and post-translational
   modification, protein turnover, chaperone functions. In gills, the early
   uptake phase was marked by a balance between DEPs related with
   ``cellular processes and signaling{''} and ``metabolism.{''} Depuration
   is clearly marked by processes related with ``metabolism,{''} mainly
   involving secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism.

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a decay equation for paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) toxins using long-term field data spanning more than 10
   years in order to predict the detoxification period for the scallop
   Patinopecten yessoensis in Ofunato Bay, Japan. From the data, we
   obtained the date of maximum toxicity in the digestive gland (DG) of the
   scallop and then the date of detoxification. Next, we performed linear
   regression analysis between log(e)-toxicities and days after the maximum
   toxicity level for each study year. Toxicity declined at a rate of 1.5
   \%/day, and a period of 3-9 months was required for the scallop to
   achieve a toxicity level of 20 mouse units (MU)/g DG tissue, which is a
   critical level for determining monitoring frequency and area of scallop
   toxicity. We then estimated the number of days needed to reach 20 MU/g
   DG tissue (t (20)) using the equations obtained by the above-mentioned
   analysis, and we performed another linear regression analysis between
   the log(e) (maximum toxicity) and t (20) for each year. The difference
   between the actual and predicted detoxification time ranged from -16 to
   18 days. We conclude that these equations can be used to predict the
   depuration of PSP toxins from scallops in Ofunato Bay.},

Title = {Distribution of Domoic Acid in the Digestive Gland of the King
   ScallopPecten maximus},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The king scallopPecten maximusretains the amnesic shellfish poisoning
   toxin, domoic acid (DA), for a long time. Most of the toxin is
   accumulated in the digestive gland, but this organ contains several cell
   types whose contribution to the accumulation of the toxin is unknown.
   Determining the time-course of the depuration by analyzing whole organs
   is difficult because the inter-individual variability is high. A
   sampling method, using biopsies of the digestive gland, has been
   developed. This method allows for repetitive sampling of the same
   scallop, but the representativeness of the samples obtained in this way
   needs to be validated. In this work, we found that the distribution of
   DA in the digestive gland of the scallops is mostly homogeneous. Only
   the area closest to the gonad, and especially its outer portion, had a
   lower concentration than the other ones, probably due to a transfer of
   the toxin to the intestinal loop. Samples obtained by biopsies can
   therefore be considered to be representative. Most of the toxin was
   accumulated in large cells (mostly digestive cells), which could be due
   to differences during the toxin absorption or to the preferential
   depuration of the toxin from the small cells (mostly secretory).},

Abstract = {Mussels are quite resistant to cyanotoxins and their resistance may be
   because of an efficient metabolization of cyanotoxins by
   glutathione-S-transferases (GST) activity. Nevertheless, other secondary
   metabolites may interfere with the detoxication efficiency. The
   accumulation and depuration of hepatotoxins produced by the freshwater
   cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa in the mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis were studied. Mussels were fed twice a day 1.5 x 10(5)
   cells/mL of the toxic cyanobacterium, which produces microcystins (MCs)
   -FR, -LR and -WR, for 4 days. After that period, the animals were placed
   in toxin-free water and were fed the green algae Ankistrodesmus sp.
   During 2 weeks, the concentration of the toxin in the mussels was
   monitored using an ELISA assay. Mussels showed a maximum detectable
   level of MCs of 0.38 mu g/g mussels dry weight (DW) during the
   accumulation period and 0.37 mu g MC/g mussel DW by day 4 of the
   depuration period. Then there was a decrease trend with peaks of toxin
   at days 8 and 12 of the depuration period. The activity of the
   detoxication enzymes GST was studied and the results showed that the
   peaks of toxin in the mussels coincide with an increase in the activity
   of GST. These results support the hypothesis that the rise of the toxin
   level on days 4, 8 and 12 of the depuration period in the mussels may be
   related to the renewal of protein phosphatases and subsequent release of
   unbound toxins. J. Exp. Zool. 311A:226-230, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Accumulation, transformation and breakdown of DSP toxins from the toxic

   edulis},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxins (DTX) and pectenotoxins (PTX)
   produced by the dinoflagellates Dinophysis spp. can accumulate in
   shellfish and cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning upon human
   consumption. Shellfish toxicity is a result of algal abundance and
   toxicity as well as accumulation and depuration kinetics in mussels. We
   mass-cultured Dinophysis acuta containing OA, DTX-1b and PTX-2 and fed
   it to the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis under controlled laboratory
   conditions for a week to study toxin accumulation and transformation.
   Contents of OA and DTX-1b in mussels increased linearly with incubation
   time, and the net toxin accumulation was 66\% and 71\% for OA and
   DTX-1b, respectively. Large proportions (approximate to 50\%) of both
   these toxins were transformed to fatty acid esters. Most PTX-2 was
   transformed to PTX-2 seco-acid and net accumulation was initially high,
   but decreased progressively throughout the experiment, likely due to
   esterification and loss of detestability. We also quantified depuration
   during the subsequent four days and found half-life times of 5-6 days
   for OA and DTX-1b. Measurements of dissolved toxins revealed that
   depuration was achieved through excreting rather than metabolizing
   toxins. This is the first study to construct a full mass balance of DSP
   toxins during both accumulation and deputation, and we demonstrate rapid
   toxin accumulation in mussels at realistic in situ levels of Dinophysis.
   Applying the observed accumulation and depuration kinetics, we model
   mussel toxicity, and demonstrate that a concentration of only 75
   Dinophysis cells I-1 is enough to make 60 mm long mussels exceed the
   regulatory threshold for OA equivalents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Most marine biotoxins are produced by microalgae. The neurotoxin
   tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been reported in many seafood species worldwide
   but its source is unknown, making accumulation and depuration studies in
   shellfish difficult. Tetrodotoxin is a water-soluble toxin and cannot be
   directly ingested by shellfish. In the present study, a method was
   developed which involved binding TTX to solid particles of humic acid
   and encapsulating them in agar-gelatin capsules. A controlled quantity
   of TTX-containing microcapsules (size range 20-280 mu m) was fed to
   Paphies australis, a bivalve known to accumulate TTX in the wild. The
   TTX-containing microcapsules were fed to P. australis every second day
   for 13 days. Ten P. australis (including five controls fed non-toxic
   microalgae) were harvested after 7 days and ten after 13 days. Paphies
   australis accumulated TTX, reaching concentrations of up to 103 mu g
   kg(-1) by day 13, exceeding the European Food Safety Authority
   recommended concentration of 44 mu g kg(-1) in shellfish. This novel
   method will allow future studies to explore the effects, accumulation
   and depuration rates of TTX in different animals and document how it is
   transferred through food webs.},

Title = {Accumulation of paralytic shellfish toxins by Southern Rock lobster
   Jasus edwardsii causes minimal impact on lobster health},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {230},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recurrent dinoflagellate blooms of Alexandrium catenella expose the
   economically and ecologically important Southern Rock Lobster in
   Tasmania to paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), and it is unknown if PST
   accumulation adversely affects lobster performance, health and
   catchability. In a controlled aquaculture setting, lobsters were fed
   highly contaminated mussels to accumulate toxin levels in the
   hepatopancreas (mean of 6.65 mg STX center dot 2HCl equiv. kg(-1)),
   comparable to those observed in nature. Physiological impact of PST
   accumulation was comprehensively assessed by a range of behavioural
   (vitality score, righting ability and reflex impairment score), health
   (haemocyte count, bacteriology, gill necrosis and parasite load),
   nutritional (hepatopancreas index and haemolymph refractive index) and
   haemolymph biochemical (21 parameters including electrolytes,
   metabolites, and enzymes) parameters during a 63 day period of uptake
   and depuration of toxins. Exposure to PST did not result in mortality
   nor significant changes in the behavioural, health, or nutritional
   measures suggesting limited gross impact on lobster performance.
   Furthermore, most haemolymph biochemical parameters measured exhibited
   no significant difference between control and exposed animals. However,
   the concentration of potassium in the haemolymph increased with PST,
   whilst the concentration of lactate and the sodium:potassium ratio
   decreased with PST. In addition, exposed lobsters showed a
   hyperglycaemic response to PST exposure, indicative of stress. These
   findings suggest that PST accumulation results in some measurable
   indicators of stress for lobsters. However, these changes are likely
   within the adaptive range for Jasus edwardsii and do not result in a
   significant impairment of gross performance. Our findings support
   previous conclusions that crustaceans are relatively tolerant to PST and
   the implications for the lobster fishery are discussed.},

   of the main paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in these samples
   and their total toxicity. Hydrophilic interaction liquid ion
   chromatography with mass spectrometric detection confirmed the toxin
   profile and detected several metabolites in the shellfish. Results show
   that C1/2 toxins were the most dominant toxins in the scallop and clam
   samples. However, GTX1/4 and GTX2/3 were also present. M1 was the
   predominant metabolite in all the samples, but M3 and M5 were also
   identified, along with three previously unreported presumed metabolites,
   M6, M8 and M10. The results indicate that the biotransformation of
   toxins was species specific. It was concluded that the reductive enzyme
   in clams is more active than in scallops and that an enzyme in scallops
   is more apt to catalyse hydrolysis of both the sulfonate moiety at the
   N-sulfocabamoyl of C toxins and the 11-hydroxysulfate of C and GTX
   toxins to produce metabolites. This is the first report of new
   metabolites of PSP toxins in scallops and clams collected in China.},

Abstract = {In October and November 2003 a bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium catenella was observed in the North-east zone of Thau lagoon
   (French Mediterranean coast). Sea water samples were collected every
   hours to evaluate time-related variations of phytoplankton
   concentrations and to compare the relative ratio of A. catenella versus
   other phytoplankton species during the outbreak. From these
   observations, trials using recirculated sea water systems were performed
   to: i) evaluate the physiological effects on oyster of increasing
   proportions of A. catenella within a mixed microalgal diet where the
   non-toxic diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii was present at concentration:
   1500 cells ml(-1), ii) compare the effect of two temperatures (12
   degrees C and 18 degrees C) on paralytic toxin accumulation rates in
   oyster flesh by ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography
   (IP-HPLC) detection, iii) analyse toxin biotransformation during the
   contamination process, iv) evaluate the role of the different types of
   oyster tissue on the bioaccumulation mechanism.
   The results showed: i) a significant e. ect of temperature increase on
   clearance rate and toxin uptake, ii) no detectable time-related effects
   of toxic algal food on pre-ingestion sorting or on toxin profiles in
   oyster flesh, iii) either negative or positive effects of A. catenella
   concentrations on toxin uptake ({''}threshold{''} effect), iv) high
   amounts of toxins in the digestive gland, accounting for more than 80\%
   of overall shellfish toxicity. The daily amount of toxins (Q(tox)) taken
   up by each oyster was evaluated by means of a global one-compartment
   model. However a two-compartment model finally gave the best match with
   real contamination kinetics, since it integrated both toxins sequestered
   in oyster tissues and toxins moving in through the digestive tract.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a water-soluble marine neurotoxin produced and
   released by certain species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia.
   Present in coastal waters, it can be a threat to public health and
   marine life, and can result in severe economic losses to the molluscan
   shellfish and crustacean harvesting industries. Here we report on the
   efficiency of nanocrystalline (NC) titania (TiO2) thin films used as a
   photocatalyst in the ultraviolet light photodegradation of DA. Titanium
   dioxide thin films produced by a sol-gel dip-coating method in the
   presence of polyethylene glycol of different molecular weights (200, 400
   and 600) were deposited on glass substrates and crystallised at 90
   degrees C. The films were characterised using spectroscopic
   ellipsometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( FTIR), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman
   spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity measurements were carried out
   by immersing the NC TiO2 films in a DA solution (2500 ng ml(-1)) and
   then exposing them for various times at room temperature to UVA
   irradiation (lambda = approximately 350 nm). The degradation of DA,
   quantified by HPLC analysis, was not significant when using daylight or
   ultraviolet light irradiation alone, whereas the NC TiO2 films prepared
   at low temperature proved to be a very efficient photocatalyst when used
   in conjunction with UVA light. The effectiveness of the photodegradation
   was improved by increasing molecular weight of polyethylene glycol,
   which increased the thickness of the film. The presence, transformation
   and degradation of three DA isomers were observed. The approach may
   eventually be practical for destroying DA in seawater used by
   aquaculture industry depuration facilities.},

Title = {Metabolic transformation of paralytic shellfish toxins in the mussel
   Mytilus galloprovincialis under different exposure modes},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Gymnodinium catenatum is a widely distributed toxic marine
   dinoflagellate that produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). It is
   prone to causing algal blooms and poses a serious threat to the
   shellfish industry and human health. Previous studies have shown that
   when algal blooms occur, shellfish can accumulate PSTs in their bodies
   due to filtration. In this study, mussels ( Mytilus galloprovincialis)
   were fed with G. catenatum at different fixed or varied cell density
   over time, with the latter designed to mimic the changes in algal cell
   density over time in the wild. The PST concentration in the mussels was
   positively correlated with the number of algal cells, and PSTs rapidly
   accumulated in the mussels under both feeding modes. Compared with
   constant feeding in the low feeding group, variable cell density feeding
   over time was more conducive to the accumulation of PSTs in M.
   galloprovincialis. An obvious toxin transformation process was also
   detected in the mussels, which transformed the less toxic gonyautoxins-5
   and-6 and N-sulfocarbamoyl gonyautoxin-3 ingested from G. catenatum into
   the more toxic decarbamoyl gonyautoxin-2, decarbamoyl saxitoxin, and
   decarbamoyl neosaxitoxin. The ratio of epimer pairs, alpha:beta, tended
   to stabilize when the toxin concentration was highest, and it increased
   rapidly after mussels stopped consuming toxigenic algae. These results
   suggested that the formation of alpha-stable toxoids mainly occurred
   during the process of toxin depuration. Toxins were also transformed
   from low to high toxicity, and alpha-stable toxoids were formed mainly
   in the hepatopancreas. These results provided basic data for better
   understanding of the laws governing metabolic transformation of PSTs in
   bivalves during algal blooms.},

Abstract = {The dynamic transmission and transformation of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs) from the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense to the
   cladoceran Moina mongolica and subsequently to the larvae of the fish
   Sciaenops ocellatus were investigated under laboratory conditions. The
   results showed that PSTs could be transferred to S. ocellatus when they
   preyed on PST-containing M. mongolica. During the experimental period,
   A. tamarense, M. mongolica and the digestive glands of the fish larvae
   contained C(1/2) toxins, and the viscera of S. ocellatus contained
   neoSTX. The proportion of beta toxin (C(2)) in C(1+2) toxins increased
   when PSTs were transferred from A. tamarense to M. mongolica, but in the
   subsequent transfer from M. mongolica to S. ocellatus the proportion of
   a toxin (C(1)) increased. During depuration, the contents of C, and C2
   toxins in fish larvae decreased with the duration of depuration, but
   neoSTX remained relatively constant. The present results indicated that,
   using a cladoceran as the vector, PSTs can be transferred from toxic
   algae to a high trophic level fish and metabolized in the fish. Future
   work should address the metabolic characteristics of PSTs in cladocerans
   and the end result when they are transferred to fishes. (c) 2007

Abstract = {To understand the biokinetics and potential risks of
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites,
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), in fish, we exposed the black
   sea breams (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) to aqueous and dietary DDTs and
   then evaluated the bioaccumulation, distribution, biotransformation, and
   elimination of DDTs under controlled laboratory conditions. The fish
   rapidly accumulated DDTs from both routes of exposure, particularly the
   gills and viscera. Elimination of DDTs following aqueous or dietary
   uptake was slow, and biotranslocation of DDTs was significant during the
   exposure period but negligible during the depuration period. The
   biotransformation process was more significant following dietary
   exposure. During depuration, DDE was the major biotransformed product in
   the sea breams' carcasses while DDD was the major product in the gills
   and viscera. However, DDD had a significantly higher elimination rate
   than DDE and, subsequently, the fish retained more DDE in the body.
   Intraspecies variability in the elimination and biotransformation
   processes in fish was observed. We demonstrated that the route of
   exposure significantly affected the fate and biokinetics of DDTs in
   fish. The application of a dynamic model provided a tool for quantifying
   the elimination and biotransformation of DDT in fish. The present study
   provided insights into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation
   pathways of DDT in fish that could have important ecotoxicological
   implications.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin naturally produced by some
   pennate diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. It is well known
   that during harmful algal blooms fish can accumulate DA in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract and act as vectors of the toxin to higher
   trophic level piscivores, often with severe neurotoxic consequences to
   the predators. Although neurotoxicity and mass mortality have been
   observed in vertebrates (i.e. marine mammals and sea birds) feeding on
   contaminated fish, to date there has been no evidence of neurobehavioral
   toxicity in the fish vectors themselves. It has been hypothesized that
   fish may not absorb DA from the digestive tract, thus making them
   insensitive to dietary consumption of DA. To test this hypothesis, we
   performed oral gavage exposures followed by a time series of tissue
   dissections to characterize uptake, depuration, and tissue distribution
   of DA in fish. Intracoelomic (IC) injection exposures (which bypass the
   GI tract) were also performed to determine if coho neurons are
   neurologically susceptible to DA. Excitotoxic symptoms were observed in
   fish via IC injection at similar toxin levels that have been reported to
   induce excitotoxic symptoms in intraperitoneal (IP) exposures with
   mammalian models such as mice, suggesting that fish neurons have a
   similar sensitivity to DA as other vertebrates. Surprisingly, after oral
   gavage with ecologically relevant doses of DA, the toxin was detected in
   plasma collected from the dorsal aorta via a permanent intraarterial
   catheter within 15 min, yet excitotoxic symptoms were not observed.
   Additionally, DA was detected in liver, heart, spleen, kidney, muscle,
   brain and bile. These data indicate that although DA is absorbed from
   the gut, fish do not exhibit neuroexcitatory effects at maximum
   ecologically relevant oral doses of DA. Tissue distribution and DA
   uptake and depuration patterns suggest that a majority of the absorbed
   toxin is excreted via the kidneys and bile, thereby preventing toxic
   levels of DA from reaching sensitive nervous tissue. Additionally,
   greater than 20\% of total IC administered DA doses were sequestered in
   bile within I h of injection in five symptomatic fish, providing
   evidence for biliary sequestration of the toxin from blood. Here, we
   comprehensively describe the uptake, depuration, and tissue distribution
   patterns of DA and propose that renal and biliary processes may serve as
   primary routes of toxin clearance in fish. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {The amnesic shellfish poisoning toxin, domoic acid: The tattoo of the

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin produced by diatoms of the genus
   Pseudo-nitzschia and is responsible for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning
   (ASP) in humans. Some fishery resources of high commercial value, such
   as the king scallop Pecten maximus, are frequently exposed to toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and are capable of accumulating high amounts of
   DA, retaining it for months or even a few years. This poses a serious
   threat to public health and a continuous economical risk due to fishing
   closures of this resource in the affected areas. Recently, it was
   hypothesized that trapping of DA within autophagosomic-vesicles could be
   one reason explaining the long retention of the remaining toxin in P.
   maximus digestive gland. To test this idea, we follow the kinetics of
   the subcellular localization of DA in the digestive glands of P. maximus
   during (a) the contamination process - with sequential samplings of
   scallops reared in the field during 234 days and naturally exposed to
   blooms of DA-producing Pseudo-nitzschia australis, and (b) the
   decontamination process - where highly contaminated scallops were
   collected after a natural bloom of toxic P. australis and subjected to
   DA-depuration in the laboratory for 60 days. In the digestive gland,
   DA-depuration rate (0.001 day(-1)) was much slower than contamination
   kinetics. The subcellular analyses revealed a direct implication of
   early autophagy in DA sequestration throughout contamination (r = 0.8, P
   < 0.05), while the presence of DA-labeled residual bodies (late
   autophagy) appeared to be strongly and significantly related to slow
   DA-depuration (r = -0.5) resembling an analogous DA-tattooing in the
   digestive glands of P. maximus. This work provides new evidence about
   the potential physiological mechanisms involved in the long retention of
   DA in P. maximus and represents the baseline to explore procedures to
   accelerate decontamination in this species.},

   under post-bloom natural conditions: Evidence of higher
   biotransformation in razor shells and cockles},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Concentrations of the paralytic shellfish toxins GTX6, C1+2, GTX5, C3+4,
   dcSTX, dcNEO and dcGTX2+3 were determined by LC-FLD in composite samples
   of whole soft tissues of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), cockles
   (Cerastodenna edule) and razor shells (Solen marginatus) after exposure
   to a Gymnodinium catenatum bloom. Specimens were harvested weekly during
   three months under natural depuration conditions in the Mira branch of
   Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. Under the decline of G. catenatum cell
   densities, elimination or transformation of the uptake toxins associated
   with the ingestion of toxic cells differed among the surveyed species.
   Ratio between the toxins dcSTX plus dcGTX2+3 plus dcNEO and toxins GTX6
   plus GTX5 plus C1+2 plus C3+4 was used to illustrate the
   biotransformation occurring in the bivalves. Enhancement of the ratios
   was observed for razor shells and cockles seven weeks after the peak of
   the algal bloom. Most likely it reflects more intense biotransformation
   in razor shells and cockles than in mussels. Conversion into toxins of
   higher toxicity may prolong the bivalve toxicity. These results show the
   complexity of toxin elimination in bivalves under post-bloom conditions
   and emphasize the pertinence of monitoring programs of bivalve toxicity
   in order to protect human health.},

Abstract = {New C-11 hydroxyl metabolites of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) have
   been reported in shellfish. To gain further information on these
   metabolites, as well as the potential for formation of phase-II
   metabolites and acyl esters of PSTs, bivalves were fed with the
   PSTs-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum (strain ATHK).
   Through independent experiments, scallops (Chlamys farreri) were fed for
   9 days and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) for 5 days plus an
   additional 5 days of depuration, with representative samples taken
   throughout. Several common PSTs (C1-4, GTX1-6 and NEO) and metabolites
   including Ml, M3, M5, M7, M9, M2 and M8 were detected in the
   hepatopancreas of scallops during toxin accumulation and in the
   hepatopancreas of mussels during both toxin accumulation and elimination
   periods. The relative molar ratio of metabolites to precursor molecules
   was used to estimate relative metabolic conversion rates. Conversion
   rates of C1/2 and GTX2/3 were higher than those of C3/4 and GTX1/4, in
   scallops and mussels. The first metabolites observed in both bivalve
   species investigated were M1/3, which are formed from C1/2. However, the
   conversion of GTX2/3 to M2 was more complete than other
   biotransformation reactions in both mussels and scallops. In general,
   metabolic conversion of PSTs was observed after a shorter time and to a
   greater extent in mussels than in scallops in the exposure period. No
   acyl esters or conjugation products of PSTs with glucuronic acid,
   glutathione, cysteine and taurine were detected by liquid chromatography
   with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the samples
   investigated. Additionally, only GTX1/4 and GTX2/3 were detected in the
   kidney of scallops, which demonstrates that PSTs are mainly metabolized
   through the hepatic metabolism pathway in bivalves. This work improves
   the understanding of PST metabolism during toxin accumulation and
   depuration in commercially harvested shellfish.},

Abstract = {From June 2006 to January 2007 passive samplers (solid phase adsorbing
   toxin tracking, SPATT) were tested as a monitoring tool with weekly
   monitoring of phytoplankton and toxin content (liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, LC-MS) in picked cells of Dinophysis
   and plankton concentrates. Successive blooms of Dinophysis acuminata, D.
   acuta and D. caudata in 2006 caused a long mussel harvesting closure
   (4.5 months) in the Galician Rias (NW Spain) and a record (up to 9246
   ng.g resin-week(-1)) accumulation of toxins in SPATT discs. Best fit of
   a toxin accumulation model was between toxin accumulation in SPATT and
   the product of cell densities by a constant value, for each species of
   Dinophysis, of toxin content (average) in picked cells. Detection of
   Dinophysis populations provided earlier warning of oncoming diarrhetic
   shellfish poisoning (DSP) outbreaks than the SPATT, which at times
   overestimated the expected toxin levels in shellfish because: (i) SPATT
   accumulated toxins did not include biotransformation and depuration loss
   terms and (ii) accumulation of toxins not available to mussels continued
   for weeks after Dinophysis cells were undetectable and mussels were
   toxin-free. SPATT may be a valuable environmental monitoring and
   research tool for toxin dynamics, in particular in areas with no
   aquaculture, but does not provide a practical gain for early warning of
   DSP outbreaks.},

Title = {The role of marine biotoxins on the trophic transfer of Mn and Zn in
   fish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {198-205},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Essential nutrients are critical for physiological processes of
   organisms. In fish, they are obtained primarily from the diet, and their
   transfer and accumulation are known to be impacted by environmental
   variables such as water temperature, pH and salinity, as well as by diet
   composition and matrices. Yet, prey items consumed by fish may also
   contain toxic compounds such as marine toxins associated with harmful
   algae. These biotoxins have the potential to affect essential trace
   element assimilation in fish through chemical interactions such as the
   formation of trace element-toxin complexes or by affecting general fish
   physiology as in the modification of ion specific transport pathways. We
   assessed the influence of dietary exposure to brevetoxins (PbTxs),
   ichthyotoxic neurotoxins produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis,
   on trophic transfer of two essential trace elements, Mn and Zn, in a
   fish model. Using ecologically relevant concentrations of PbTxs and
   trace elements in controlled laboratory conditions, juvenile turbots
   Scophthalmus max-Onus were given food containing PbTxs before or at the
   same time as a feeding with radiotracers of the chosen essential
   elements (Mn-54 and Zn-65). Treatments included simultaneous exposure
   (PbTxs + Mn-54 + Zn-65) in a single-feeding, 3-week daily pre-exposure
   to dietary PbTx followed by a single feeding with Mn-54 and Zn-65, and a
   control (Mn-54 and Zn-65 only). After a 21-day depuration period, turbot
   tissue brevetoxin levels were quantified and assimilation efficiencies
   of Mn-54 and Zn-65 were assessed. PbTxs were found in turbot tissues in
   each exposure treatment, demonstrating dietary trophic transfer of these
   toxins; yet, no differences in assimilation efficiencies of Mn or Zn
   were found between treatments or the control (p > 0.05). These results
   indicate that, in our experimental conditions, PbTx exposure does not
   significantly affect the trophic transfer of Mn and Zn in fish.},

Title = {The uptake, distribution and elimination of paralytic shellfish toxins
   in mussels and fish exposed to toxic dinoflagellates},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},

Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {We exposed green-lipped mussels Perna viridis and black sea breams
   Acanthopagrus schlegeli to toxic dinoflagellates Alexandrium fundyense
   to evaluate the accumulation, distribution, transformation, and
   elimination of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in a controlled
   environmental condition. The mussels were fed A. fundyense for 7 days
   followed by 3 weeks of deputation, and the fish were fed toxic clams
   (pre-exposed to the dinoflagellates) for 5 days followed by 2 weeks of
   deputation. The toxin content and the compartmental distribution of PSTs
   were monitored throughout the experiments by high-performance liquid
   chromatography with post-column fluorescence derivatization (HPLC-FLD).
   This is the first report to assess the biokinetics of PSTs in marine
   fish under dietary exposure. The hepatopancreas in the mussels and the
   viscera in the fish accumulated most of the PSTs. Differential
   elimination of each toxin was observed in the mussels. The C2 toxins
   were eliminated rapidly in all organs; except in hepatopancreas, the
   more potent toxins such as GTX4, were eliminated slower during the
   deputation period. The relative proportions of various PSTs in the
   mussels changed over time, suggesting toxin-specific uptake and
   elimination rates, or biotransformation preferences between toxins. In
   the fish, the ratio of C1/C2 was 3.0 times (p < 0.01) higher when
   compared to the clam tissues, indicating that conversion from C2 to C1
   might have occurred when the toxin was transferred from the clams to the
   fish. In summary, species differences in uptake, distribution and
   elimination of PSTs were observed between mussels and fish, and this may
   influence trophic transfer of algal toxins in marine organisms. (c) 2006

Abstract = {Accumulation of Nodularia spumigena toxins by Mytilus edulis was studied
   during laboratory and mesocosm experiments in order to investigate the
   possible pathways of nodularin in mussels and calculate toxin budgets.
   Mussels were exposed to 0.2-15.6 mu g nodularin 1(-1), fed for up to 5
   days with Nodularia cells from culture, or blooming in different
   nutrient-treated seawater. Toxin concentration was monitored with
   LC-ESI-MS.
   During different exposures, the amount of nodularin detected in mussels
   increased linearly with increasing toxin concentration in food and
   attained 0.28-13.8 mu g of nodularin g dw(-1) of the mussel whole body
   tissue after 12h. The digestive gland was found to be the tissue with
   the highest toxin concentration. Nodularin concentration in faeces was
   not proportional to faeces production or to toxin concentration in food;
   however, it seemed to be mostly related to food quality as well as to
   food availability. The percentage of nodularin taken up by the mussels,
   relative to the amount contained in the offered food, varied from 10\%
   to 20\%, depending on food quality. During a 5-day toxin accumulation
   experiment, the acute reduction of the toxin in mussel tissues the
   second day and the following stabilization, showed that probably mussels
   maintain low toxin levels via efficient elimination and/or toxin
   metabolism. After a 72 h depuration period, mussels showed 75\%
   reduction in their toxin content. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The patent marine neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) was detected in razor
   clams and Dungeness crabs on the Pacific Coast of the United States in
   1991, resulting in temporary closures of these fisheries. Closures
   protect the health of human consumers of clams and crabs but impose
   significant economic losses to the communities that are dependent on
   these fisheries. Widespread closures, and in the case of the clams
   long-lasting ones, were necessary risk management strategies because our
   knowledge of DA uptake and movement through the food web is very
   limited. In order to resolve some of these issues and provide health
   managers with better information concerning this toxin, experiments were
   conducted on the accumulation and fate of DA in Dungeness crabs. Such
   information could provide enhanced safety, permit more efficient
   closures, and lessen the economic effect of future outbreaks.
   In the first study, razor clams, containing known concentrations of DA,
   were fed to Dungeness crabs for 5 days to determine the uptake of the
   toxin by the crabs. Twenty-four hours after the crabs ingested an
   initial 960 mu g of toxin, 260 mu g of DA (27\%) was found in the
   hepatopancreas (HP) of the crabs. At the end of 6 days, 68\% (2,850 mu
   g), from an accumulated 4,220 mu g of ingested toxin, was present in the
   HP. DA was never found in the hemolymph or edible muscle of crabs in
   this experiment, but DA was found in the feces, indicating a route of
   depuration.
   The second study examined the depuration of DA by crabs under fed and
   starved conditions. Crabs fed DA-contaminated clams for 4 days achieved
   an average concentration of 69.5 mu g of DA/g of HP. After 7 days, crabs
   that were fed toxin-free clams three times per week showed a 38\%
   reduction in DA concentration, to 43.4 mu g of DA/g, whereas the average
   toxin concentration in the HP of crabs that were starved was reduced by
   only 4\%, to 66.9 mu g of DA/g.
   In the last sampling, taken at 21 days, the concentration of DA in the
   HP of fed crabs decreased by 89\% of the initial DA concentration to 7.6
   mu g of DA/g, but that of the starved crabs decreased by only 57\%, to
   29.7 mu g of DA/g. Differences in mean concentrations between starved
   and fed crabs at 7, 14, and 21 days were significant. Additional
   measurements at 21 days showed the average weight of a starved crab's HP
   was only 53\% of the fed crab's HP (25.7 vs. 48.7g). Although the mean
   weight of the starved crabs (770 g) was greater than that of the fed
   crabs (730 g), the difference was not significant.},

Title = {Rapid uptake and slow depuration: Health risks following cyanotoxin
   accumulation in mussels?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {271},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Freshwater cyanobacteria produce highly toxic secondary metabolites,
   which can be transported downstream by rivers and waterways into the
   sea. Estuarine and coastal aquaculture sites exposed to toxic
   cyanobacteria raise concerns that shellfish may accumulate and transfer
   cyanotoxins in the food web. This study aims to describe the competitive
   pattern of uptake and depuration of a wide range of microcystins (MC-LR,
   MC-LF, MC-LW, MC-LY, {[}Asp3]-MC-LR/{[}Dha7]-MC-LR, MC-HiIR) and
   nodularins (NOD cyclic and linear) within the common blue mussel Mytilus
   edulis exposed to a combined culture of Microcystis aeruginosa and
   Nodularia spumigena into the coastal environment.
   Different distribution profiles of MCs/NODs in the experimental system
   were observed. The majority of MCs/NODs were present intracellularly
   which is representative of healthy cyanobacterial cultures, with MC-LR
   and NOD the most abundant analogues. Higher removal rate was observed
   for NOD ( approximate to 96\%) compared to MCs ( approximate to 50\%)
   from the water phase. Accumulation of toxins in M. edulis was fast,
   reaching up to 3.4 mu g/g shellfish tissue four days after the end of
   the 3-days exposure period, with NOD (1.72 mu g/g) and MC-LR (0.74 mu
   g/g) as the dominant toxins, followed by MC-LF (0.35 mu g/g) and MC-LW
   (0.31 mu g/g). Following the end of the exposure period depuration was
   incomplete after 27 days (0.49 mu g/g of MCs/NODs). MCs/NODs were also
   present in faecal material and extrapallial fluid after 24 h of exposure
   with MCs the main contributors to the total cyanotoxin load in faecal
   material and NOD in the extrapallial fluid. Maximum concentration of
   MCs/NODs accumulated in a typical portion of mussels (20 mussels,
   approximate to 4 g each) was beyond greater the acute, seasonal and
   lifetime tolerable daily intake. Even after 27 days of depuration,
   consuming mussels harvested during even short term harmful algae blooms
   in close proximity to shellfish beds might carry a high health risk,
   highlighting the need for testing. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

   producing the diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) okadaic acid (OA) and
   dinophysistoxin (DTX). These compounds may cause oxidative stress and
   accumulate in bivalve tissues, which become vectors of intoxication to
   human consumers. We investigated DST accumulation, detoxification and
   oxidative stress biomarkers in clams (Anomalocardia flexuosa)
   experimentally exposed to P. lima cells or their compounds. Experimental
   diets consisted of 6000 cells mL(-1) of the non-toxic chlorophyte
   Tetraselmis sp. (C; control condition), and combinations of C with 10 P.
   lima cells mL(-1) (T10), 100 P. lima cells mL(-1) (T100), or to a toxin
   concentration of similar to 4 mu g OA L-1 and similar to 0.65 mu g DTX-1
   L-1 (T100d). Clams were exposed to these diets for 7 days (uptake
   phase), followed by a 7-day depuration period. No DSTs were detected in
   clams exposed to treatments C (control) nor to T100d (dissolved
   compounds) during either uptake or detoxification phase. Conversely,
   clams exposed to T10 or T100 accumulated, on average, up to 2.5 and 35
   mu g DST kg(-1) in their whole bodies at the end of the uptake phase.
   These concentrations are similar to 64 and similar to 4.5 times lower
   than the regulatory level of 160 mu g OA kg(-1), respectively.
   Accumulated OA quotas were 12-22 times higher in the digestive gland
   (DG) than in remaining tissues over the uptake phase. Quick toxin
   transformation was indicated by the early detection of conjugated
   compounds - DTX-1 and OA esters - in the DG after 6 h of exposure, with
   OA-ester representing the main compound (30 -100 \%) in that tissue over
   the experiment. During the depuration period, detoxification rates
   represented 0.024 h(-1), 0.04 h(-1) and 0.052 h(-1) for OA, DTX-1 and
   OA-ester, respectively. The activities of catalase, glutathione
   S-transferase, glutathione pemxidase and the levels of oxidative stress
   by lipoperoxidation varied similarly in the DG of A. flexuosa
   individuals subjected to T100, T100d and the control condition. However,
   contrasting antioxidant responses were measured in those exposed to T10.
   These findings indicate that no oxidative stress was primarily induced
   by DST-producing dinoflagellates in this clam species under laboratory
   conditions representative of toxic bloom situations. Even though,
   possible interactions should be considered under multistressor
   scenarios.},

Title = {The value of toxin profiles in the chemotaxonomic analysis of paralytic
   shellfish toxins in determining the relationship between British
   Alexandrium spp. and experimentally contaminated Mytilus sp.},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Although phytoplankton is ubiquitous in the world's oceans some species
   can produce compounds that cause damaging effects in other organisms.
   These include the toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning,
   which, in UK waters, are produced by dinoflagellates from the
   Alexandrium genus. Within Great Britain (GB) a monitoring programme
   exists to detect this harmful genus as well as the Paralytic Shellfish
   Poisoning (PSP) toxins in the flesh of shellfish from classified
   production areas. The techniques used for toxin analysis allow for
   detailed analysis of the toxin profiles present in contaminated
   shellfish. It is possible to compare the toxin profiles of contaminated
   shellfish with the profiles from toxin producing algae and use this
   information to infer the causative microalgal species responsible for
   the contamination. This study sought to evaluate the potential for this
   process within the GB monitoring framework. Two species of toxic
   Alexandrium, A. catenella from Scotland and A. minutum from Southern
   England, were fed to mussels (Mytilus sp.) under controlled conditions.
   The toxin profile in mussels derived from feeding on each species
   independently, when mixed and when introduced sequentially was analysed
   and compared to the source algal cultures using K means cluster
   analysis. Toxin profiles in contaminated shellfish clustered with those
   of the causative algae and separately from one another during toxin
   accumulation and, where A. catenella was the sole toxin source, during
   depuration. During depuration after feeding with A. minutum and where
   mixed or sequential feeding was undertaken deviant toxin profiles were
   observed. Finally, data generated within this experimental study were
   compared to monitoring data from the GB official control programme.
   These data indicated that the causative algal species in sole source
   contaminations could be inferred from toxin profile analysis. This
   technique will be of benefit within monitoring programmes to enhance the
   value of data with minimal additional expense, where the toxin profiles
   of causative microalgae have been well described.},

Title = {Effect of food supply on the detoxification in the blue mussel,
   Mytilus edulis, contaminated by diarrhetic shellfish toxins},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify a possible effect of food on
   the acceleration of decontamination in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis,
   containing diarrhetic toxins belonging to the okadaic acid (OA)
   structural group. An experimental protocol was designed to describe and
   compare the decontamination kinetics and detoxification rates of
   naturally OA-contaminated mussels that had either received or not
   received food for three weeks. The protocol was applied in two trials
   (in June 2006 and June 2007, called Ker06 and Ker07), conducted one year
   apart on samples of mussels collected in the same area, at the same
   season. Okadaic acid (OA), the main lipophilic toxin produced by the
   toxic alga Dinophysis acuminata, was analysed over the course of the
   decontamination, in hydrolysed (total OA) and non hydrolysed (free OA)
   digestive gland extracts, in order to estimate acyl-esters
   (7-O-acyl-ester derivatives of OA) concentrations. OA analyses were also
   made for toxin presence in biodeposits and in the aqueous phase. Bivalve
   physiological status was evaluated by biomass measurements (dry weight
   of flesh) and two biochemical compounds (total lipid and glycogen
   concentrations). Measured physiological parameters showed that mussels
   did not suffer under experimental conditions. Both trials showed that
   the food accelerated the elimination of free and total OA. This effect
   cannot be attributed to a dilution of the toxin in the tissue, as
   results expressed in toxin burden led to the same conclusion. The
   kinetic models of decontamination differed between the two experiments:
   the model was linear for Ker06, provided that the values corresponding
   to the first two days were discarded, whereas data fitted a decreasing
   exponential curve better in Ker07. Detoxification rates increased as the
   food supply increased. After three weeks of experimentation, the
   detoxification rates for total OA in Ker06 and Ker07 were 52 and 61\%,
   respectively, in unfed mussels and 90 and 89\% in fed mussels (with the
   highest level in Ker07). Comparisons between the free OA and esters
   showed that detoxification rate was higher for free OA than for esters,
   whatever the level of food supply. The results of this study suggest
   that food increase probably accelerates elimination of OA and OA-esters
   but the latter are eliminated at a lower speed.},

Abstract = {Bivalve farming plays a dominant role in mariculture in China. Paralytic
   shellfish toxins (PSTs) can be accumulated in bivalves and cause
   poisoning the consumers. A sensitive detection of PSTs can provide early
   warning to decrease poisoning events in bivalve consuming. PSTs are
   traditionally examined using the whole soft-tissues. However, PSTs
   accumulation varies dramatically in different tissues of bivalves. Some
   tough tissues/organs (such as mantle), which account for a large
   proportion of the total soft body, exhibit a lower accumulation of PSTs
   and make the toxin extraction time- and reagent-consuming, potentially
   decreasing the accuracy and sensitivity of PSTs monitoring in bivalves.
   To develop a sensitive and cost-effective approach for PSTs examination
   in massively farmed bivalves, we fed three commercially important
   bivalves, Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, Pacific oyster
   Crassostrea gigas, and blue mussel Mytilus edulis with PSTs-producing
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, and detected PSTs concentration in
   different tissues. For all three bivalve species, the digestive gland
   accumulated much more PSTs than other tissues, and the digestive gland's
   toxicity was significantly correlated with the PSTs toxicity of the
   whole soft-tissues, with r(2) = 0.94, 0.92, and 0.94 for Yesso scallop,
   Pacific oyster, and blue mussel, respectively. When the toxicity of the
   whole soft-tissues reached 80 mu g STXeq(100g)(-1), the regulatory limit
   for commercial shellfish, the digestive gland's toxicity reached 571.48,
   498.90, and 859.20 mu g STXeq(100g)(-1) in Yesso scallop, Pacific
   oyster, and blue mussel, respectively. Our results indicate that
   digestive gland can be used for the sensitive and cost-effective
   monitoring of PSTs in bivalves.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms tend to be more common in warm and
   nutrient-enriched waters and are increasing in many aquatic water bodies
   due to eutrophication. The aim of this work is to study the accumulation
   and deputation of anatoxin-a by Mytilus galloprovincialis a widespread
   distributed mussel living in estuarine and coastal waters and recognized
   worldwide as a bioindicator (e.g. Mussel Watch programs). Research on
   the distribution and biological effects of anatoxin-a in M.
   galloprovincialis is important. Nevertheless, the risk of human
   intoxication due to the consumption of contaminated bivalves should also
   be considered. A toxic bloom was simulated in an aquarium with 5 x 10(5)
   cell ml(-1) of Anabaena sp. (ANA 37), an anatoxin-a producing strain.
   Mussels were exposed to Anabaena for 15 days and then 15 days of
   depuration followed. Three or more animals were sampled every 24 h for
   total toxin quantification and distribution in soft tissues (edible
   parts). Water samples were also taken every 24 h in order to calculate
   total dissolved and particulate anatoxin-a concentrations. Anatoxin-a
   was quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. No deaths occurred
   during accumulation and depuration periods. One day after the beginning
   of deputation, the toxin could not be detected in the animals.
   Anatoxin-a is distributed in the digestive tract, muscles and foot and
   is probably actively detoxified. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Uptake of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins by Blacklip Abalone (Haliotis
   rubra rubra Leach) from direct exposure to Alexandrium
   catenella microalgal cells and toxic aquaculture feed},

Abstract = {The Tasmanian abalone fishery represents the largest wild abalone
   resource in the world, supplying close to 25\% of the annual wild-caught
   global harvest. Prompted by the need to manage Paralytic Shellfish Toxin
   (PST) contamination of Blacklip Abalone (Haliotis rubra rubra) from east
   coast Tasmania, the uptake of toxins by this species is investigated in
   a land-based, controlled aquaculture setting. Abalone were exposed to
   either live Alexandrium catenella microalgal cultures or PST
   contaminated feed pellets during a 28 day exposure period and toxins
   quantified in viscera, foot muscle and epipodium tissues. PST profiles
   of abalone foot tissues were dominated by saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin,
   whilst viscera more closely resembled those of the toxin source (A.
   catenella cells rich in gonyautoxin 1\&4 and 2\&3 or feed pellets
   containing A. catenella extracts rich in these analogues). This
   indicates direct uptake of PST in the viscera via browsing/grazing on
   the pellet and /or sedi-mented microalgal cells. After exposure to A.
   catenella cell culture, PST concentrations in the foot (muscle +
   epipodium) were on average 8 times higher than in the viscera. Higher
   toxicity of foot tissue was caused by higher PST content of the
   epipodium (up to 1,085 mu g STX.2HCl equiv. kg(-1)), which despite its
   small contribution to total animal weight significantly added to the
   overall toxin burden. Higher PST levels in the abalone foot suggest that
   toxin monitoring programmes may not need to routinely analyse both foot
   and viscera, potentially allowing for a 50\% reduction of analytical
   costs. This option is being further investigated with continuing field
   studies.},

Abstract = {Contamination of economic bivalves with paralytic shellfish toxins (PST)
   occurs frequently in many parts of the world, which potentially
   threatens consumer health and the marine aquaculture economy. It is the
   objective of this study to develop a suitable technology for
   accelerating detoxification of PST from shellfish using activated carbon
   (AC). The adsorption efficiency of PST by eight different AC materials
   and by different particle sizes of wood-based AC (WAC) were tested and
   compared. Then WAC particles (37-48 mu m) were fed to mussels Mytilus
   galloprovincialis and scallops Chlamys farreri previously contaminated
   with PST through feeding with dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense ATHK.
   Results showed that the maximum adsorption ratio (65\%) of PST was
   obtained by WAC. No significant differences in adsorption ratios were
   found between different particle sizes of WAC. The toxicity of mussels
   decreased by 41\% and 68\% after detoxification with WAC for 1 d and 3
   d, respectively. Meanwhile, the detoxification ratio of mussels was
   approximately 3 times higher than that of scallops. This study suggests
   that the WAC could be used to accelerate the detoxification of PST by
   shellfish.},

Title = {Cyanobacterial toxins: a qualitative meta-analysis of concentrations,

Abstract = {This paper reviews the rapidly expanding literature on the ecological
   effects of cyanobacterial toxins. The study employs a qualitative
   meta-analysis from the literature examining results from a large number
   of independent studies and extracts general patterns from the literature
   or signals contradictions. The meta-analysis is set up by putting
   together two large tables - embodying a large and representative part of
   the literature (see Appendix A). The first table (Table A. 1) reviews
   the presence (concentrations) of different cyanobacterial toxins in the
   tissues of various groups of aquatic biota after exposure via different
   routes, experimentally in the lab or via natural routes in the
   environment. The second table (Table A.2) reviews the dose dependent
   effect of toxins on biota. The great majority of studies deal with the
   presence and effects of microcystin, especially of the MC-LR congener.
   Although this may partly be justified - MC-LR is an abundant and highly
   toxic protein - our review also emphasizes what is known about (i) other
   MC congeners (a number of studies showed a preferred accumulation of the
   less toxic variant MC-RR in animal tissues), (ii) nodularin (data on a
   range of biota from studies on the Baltic Sea), (iii) neurotoxins like
   anatoxin-a(s), which are conspicuously often present at times when mass
   mortalities of birds occur, (iv) a few studies on the presence and
   effects of cylindrospermposin, as well as (v) the first examples of
   ecological effects of newly identified bioactive compounds, like
   microviridin-J. Data were reorganized to assess to what extent
   bioconcentration (uptake and concentration of toxins from the water) or
   biomagnification (uptake and concentration via the food) of
   cyanobacterial toxins occurs in ecosystems. There is little support for
   the occurrence of biomagnification, and this reduces the risk for biota
   at higher trophic levels. Rather than biomagnification biodilution seems
   to occur in the foodweb with toxins being subject to degradation and
   excretion at every level. Nevertheless toxins were present at all tropic
   levels, indicating that some vectorial transport must take place, and in
   sufficient quantities for effects to possibly occur. Feeding seemed to
   be the most important route for exposure of aquatic biota to
   cyanobacterial toxins. A fair number of studies focus on dissolved
   toxins, but in those studies purified toxin typically is used, and biota
   do not appear very sensitive to this form of exposure. More effects are
   found when crude cyanobacterial cell lysates are used, indicating that
   there may be synergistic effects between different bioactive compounds.
   Aquatic biota are by no means defenseless against toxic cyanobacteria.
   Several studies indicate that those species that are most frequently
   exposed to toxins in their natural environment are also the most
   tolerant. Protection includes behavioral mechanisms, detoxication of MC
   and NODLN by conjugation with glutathione, and fairly rapid depuration
   and excretion. A common theme in much of the ecological studies is that
   of modulating factors. Effects are seldom straightforward, but are
   dependent on factors like the (feeding) condition of the animals,
   environmental conditions and the history of exposure (acclimation and
   adaptation to toxic cyanobacteria). This makes it harder to generalize
   on what is known about ecological effects of cyanobacterial toxins. The
   paper concludes by summarizing the risks for birds, fish,
   macroinvertebrates and zooplankton.
   Although acute (lethal) effects are mentioned in the literature, mass
   mortalities of -especially fish are more likely to be the result of
   multiple stress factors that co-occur during cyanobacterial blooms.
   Bivalves appear remarkably resistant, whilst the harmful effects of
   cyanobacteria on zooplankton vary widely and the specific contribution
   of toxins is hard to evaluate.},

Abstract = {Pectenotoxins (PTXs) are a group of marine algal toxins which have been
   found in dinoflagellates and shellfishes. In the present study the
   metabolism of pectenotoxins in brown crabs Cancer pagurus was
   investigated. The feeding experiments were carried out at Tjarno Marine
   Biological Laboratory in Sweden in September of 2006. Brown crabs, both
   male and female with all body parts intact, were collected at 15 to 25 m
   depth of the coast of Tjarno. The toxic blue mussels Mytilus edulis (
   211.4 mu g/kg PTX-2, 2,781.4 mu g/kg PTX-2 SA, 236.3 mu g/kg 7-epi-PTX-2
   SA, 138.3 mu g/kg PTX-12a and 138.7 mu g/kg PTX-12b) were sampled from
   south coast of Norway. The crabs were kept in individual cages in tanks
   with continuous pumping of deep sea water at temperatures ranging from
   10 to 12 C during the experiment. Brown crabs were fed toxic blue
   mussels for 21 days and depurated for 42 days. Toxins were extracted
   with methanol from the digestive glands of contaminated crabs,
   uncontaminated crabs ( control group) and blue mussels. Extracts of crab
   digestive glands and mussel meat were fractionated by liquid-liquid
   partitioning and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
   mass spectrometry. Comparison among the chromatograms of extracts
   revealed the presence of PTX-2, PTX-2 SA, 7-epi-PTX-2 SA, PTX-12 and a
   new PTX-like compound which was designated metabolite-1 in crabs. The
   concentrations of PTXs in the crabs were analyzed during the depuration.
   A one-compartment model was applied to describe the depuration of PTXs.
   The half-life of PTX-2, PTX-2 SA, 7-epiPTX-2 SA, PTX-12a, PTX-12b and
   metabolite-1 were estimated to be respectively 6.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.5, 7.5,
   7.0 days. After a 42-day depuration the amount of PTXs measured in crab
   digestive glands was less than 1 mu g/kg. The metabolite-1 in crab
   digestive glands was extracted with methanol, purified by solid phase
   extraction with silica gel 60 ( Merck) columns and analyzed by liquid
   chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry. The LC-MS2 mass
   spectrum of metabolite-1 {[}M+Na]+ ion at m/z 897.5 showed fragment ions
   at m/z 853.5 and 555.5 typical of those exhibited by other pectentoxins.
   The molecular weight of metabolite-1 was 874, the same of PTX-11. The OH
   group in the molecular of metabolite-1 was somewhere in the C16-C33
   fragment.},

Abstract = {Galicia is an area with a strong mussel aquaculture industry in addition
   to other important bivalve mollusc fisheries. Between 2014 and 2017,
   18,862 samples were analyzed for EU regulated marine lipophilic toxins.
   Okadaic acid (OA) was the most prevalent toxin and the only single toxin
   that produced harvesting closures. Toxin concentrations in raft mussels
   were generally higher than those recorded in other bivalves, justifying
   the use of this species as an indicator. The Rias of Pontevedra and
   Muros were the ones most affected by OA and DTX2 and the Ria of Ares by
   YTXs. In general, the outer areas of the Rias were more affected by OA
   and DTX2 than the inner ones. The OA level reached a maximum in spring,
   while DTX2 was almost entirely restricted to the fall-winter season.
   YTXs peaked in August-September. The toxins of the OA group were nearly
   completely esterified in all the bivalves studied except mussels and
   queen scallops. Risk of intoxication with the current monitoring system
   is low. In less than 2\% of cases did the first detection of OA in an
   area exceed the regulatory limit. In no case, could any effect on humans
   be expected. The apparent intoxication and depuration rates were similar
   and directly related, suggesting that the rates are regulated mainly by
   oceanographic characteristics.},

Abstract = {Surveys of DSP (Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning) toxin profiles in the
   mussel Mytilus gallopro-vincialis from coastal waters of the central
   Adriatic Sea, over the years 1995 to 2001, demonstrate that incidents of
   shellfish toxicity in this area are dominated by the occurrence of
   okadaic acid (OA) and a PTX derivative, 7-epi-pectenotoxin-2-seco acid
   (7-epi-PTX-2SA). Toxin composition and the relative ratio of toxic
   components in shellfish is in correlation with the occurrence of DSP
   producing organisms from the Dinophysis species along with Prorocentrum
   micans and Lingulodinium polyedrum. The occurrence of D. sacculus
   shortly before the appearance of OA in shellfish implicates its possible
   involvement as the source of toxicity. In the central Adriatic, the
   infestation period generally ranges from June to August. Augmented toxin
   production may shift the depuration phase to September; however, the
   length of decontamination period is not in correlation with increased
   initial toxicity. The mussel M. galloprovincialis may retain
   contamination with 7-epi-PTX-2SA beyond the commonly recognized
   infestation period, extending the risk of human poisoning from
   consumption of seco-contaminated seafood.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms cause important economical losses due to the
   accumulation of toxins in shellfish. Natural detoxification occurs but
   this mechanism is very slow in most cases. The achievement of a method
   for the rapid detoxification of commercial bivalves would be very
   interesting for the shellfish harvesting sector in order to diminish
   economical losses due to harvesting areas closure. In this work, four
   different methods easily applicable in the food industry (freezing,
   evisceration, ozonization and thermal processing) were studied to gain
   the detoxification of four species of bivalves (mussels, scallops, clams
   and cockles) contaminated with the three main types of toxins (ASP, DSP,
   PSP). Results show that for ASP a significant decrease of the toxin
   levels below the legal limit (20 mu g/g) is achieved by using
   hepatopancreas ablation or combination of simple steps (evisceration
   and/or thermal processing/and or freezing). In our hands, PSP toxin
   levels are sharply decreased under the limit of detection (35 mu g STX
   eq/100g) after a thermal processing, inducing percentages of
   detoxification higher than 50\%. The effect of freezing on the levels of
   PSP is very dependent on the matrix studied. DSP toxins are not
   significantly reduced with none of these methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Spirolide uptake and detoxification by Crassostrea gigas exposed
   to the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {358},
Pages = {108-115},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed 4 days to cultures of the toxic
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii (strain CCMP1773) that produces
   spirolides belonging to fast acting toxins (FAT) and let depurate for 7
   days. During depuration, oysters were either fed the non-toxic algae
   Isochrysis galbana Tahitian clone (T. Iso) or starved. The objectives of
   this experiment were to evaluate (i) spirolide uptake and depuration by
   oysters (ii) spirolide effects on oysters and (iii) oyster recovery
   according to food supply during depuration.
   A. ostenfeldii cells were filtered and ingested by oysters while faeces
   contained numerous intact cells of the toxic diet. This suggested that
   ingested cells were not totally digested by oysters. Contents of
   spirolides (SPX) in digestive gland and remaining tissues during
   contamination and detoxification periods were measured by liquid
   chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Four
   different SPX analogues (13,19-didesMeC, 13-desMeC, 13-desMeD and trace
   of SPX-D) were detected. The 13,19-didesMeC-SPX dominated in both
   digestive gland and remaining tissues. After four days exposure,
   digestive gland (DG) contained 83\% of the total initial spirolide
   concentration, whereas remaining tissues contained only 17\%. During
   detoxification, spirolide content in DG was lower in fed than in unfed
   oysters but similar in remaining tissues.
   Exposure to A. ostenfeldii resulted in an inflammatory response
   consisting of hemocyte infiltration and diapedesis into the intestinal
   tract of the oysters. Percentage of active digestive tubules in oysters
   fed A. ostenfeldii was significantly lower than in control (prior
   exposition) oysters (36\% and 61\%, respectively). At the end of the
   detoxification period, there was a significant difference in the
   percentage of active digestive tubules (P<0.001) between fed and unfed
   oysters. When oysters were fed T-Iso following the A. ostenfeldii
   exposure, 80\% of digestive tubules were active, thus revealing a rapid
   recovery after toxic algae exposure.
   Overall, both spirolide detoxification and recovery from their toxic
   effects are almost complete within 7 days after exposure to spirolide
   producers. Such informationmay help to resume faster oyster sales after
   toxic events involving FAT implying thus more frequent chemical
   analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A simple system was used to simulate the effect of alternating toxic
   (paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins) and non-toxic microalgal diets on
   oyster feeding behaviors and rates of toxin accumulation. These
   experimental conditions were meant to reflect, to some extent, the
   incoming and outgoing fluxes of toxic algae observed at the mouth of the
   Penze estuary (Northern Brittany, France). Physiological and
   toxicological parameters were estimated based oil fluorescence
   measurements recorded continuously at the outlet of each experimental
   tank, which contained a single oyster. Q(tox), this variable describes
   toxin uptake in oysters, it was used (instead of the toxin ingestion
   rate): i) in simple graphical analyses, ii) as well as in one- and
   two-compartment models. Results Show that toxin Uptake varies widely
   from one individual to another and is not proportional to the
   concentration of toxic algae in sea water. A one-compartment model with
   individual fluorescence recordings as ``input{''} data gave questionable
   results, however, a two-compartment model was found to effectively
   describe coil lamination kinetics ill oysters. Limitations of this model
   as well as possible improvements are discussed.},

Abstract = {1. Ciguatera is a disease caused by sodium channel activator toxins and
   results from the consumption of warm water fish contaminated by the
   ciguatoxin class of polyether toxins. 2. Other toxins, including okadaic
   acid and maitotoxin, have no proven role in causing human illness
   associated with ciguatera. 3. Ciguatera often affects only a discrete
   region of a reef, with flare-ups of ciguatera being both temporally and
   spatially unpredictable. 4. The ciguatoxins likely arise through the
   biotransformation and acid-catalysed spiroisomerisation of
   gambiertoxin-4A produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus and it is unlikely
   that other toxic benthic dinoflagellates are involved. 5. Events leading
   to a ciguatera outbreak are initiated by environmental and genetic
   factors that favour the proliferation of gambiertoxins, with an apparent
   role for anthropomorphic effects; however, the precise factors involved
   are yet to be determined. 6. The gambiertoxins and/or ciguatoxins are
   transferred from the benthos to herbivorous species (fish, invertebrates
   etc) and then to carnivorous fish via marine food chains. 7. Factors
   influencing the concentration of ciguatoxins that accumulate in fish
   include the rate of dietary intake, the efficiency of assimilation, the
   degree and nature of any toxin biotransformation, the rate of
   depuration, and the rate of growth of fish.},

Abstract = {Dinophysis spp. blooms and related shellfish toxicity events of
   diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) have been the most reported
   toxicity event through the Croatian National monitoring program. With
   the aim to characterize the DSP toxin profile in shellfish farmed in
   Croatia, for the first time a complete analysis of the toxin profile of
   Croatian mussels has been carried out using the LC-MS/MS technique. The
   obtained results showed okadaic acid (OA) as the main toxin
   contaminating Croatian mussels at that time. The maximum concentration
   of OA in shellfish tissue was recorded 12 days after the Dinophysis
   fortii bloom, thus suggesting that rapid growth of the toxin level in
   the shellfish occurred in the first week after the bloom while it was
   slower in the second week. Furthermore, the presence of only OA at
   concentrations which could endanger human health suggests D. fortii as
   the main organism responsible for the toxic event that occurred in Lim
   Bay. The presence of gymnodimine and spirolides in Croatian mussel has
   been detected for the first time, while the presence of yessotoxin and
   pectenotoxin-2 is confirmed.},

Abstract = {Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were exposed to an extract made of natural
   cyanobacterial mixture containing toxic cyanobacterium Nodularia
   spumigena (70-110 mu g nodularin 1(-1), 24-h exposure followed by 144-h
   deputation period in clean water). Toxin concentration increased from
   initial 400 to 1100 mg kg(-1) after 24-h exposure, measured by liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Acetylcholinesterase activity
   (AChE), a biomarker of direct neurotoxic effects, showed inhibition
   after 12 and 24 h exposure but returned to control level during the
   deputation period. Catalase (CAT) activity, an indicator of oxidative
   stress, showed significantly elevated levels in exposed mussels but only
   72 h after the end of the exposure. No change in the activity of
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST) involved in conjugation reactions could
   be observed. A gradual yet incomplete elimination of nodularin (from
   1100 to 600 mg kg(-1)) was observed during the deputation period, and
   the tissue levels were 30\% lower in clean water after 24 h. The
   observed increase in oxidative stress indicated by elevated CAT activity
   is likely connected to detoxification reactions leading to the
   production of reactive oxygen species, including an apparent time lag in
   this specific enzymatic defence response. That no change in GST activity
   was observed suggests that this enzyme is not significantly involved in
   the detoxification process of nodularin-containing cyanobacterial
   extract in M. edulis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purple clams (Hiatula rostrata Lighttoot) accumulate paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP) toxins produced by a toxic strain of the dinoflagellate
   Alexandrium minutum Halim. The results confirm the data of our previous
   study concerning the muscle and siphon that were not showing a gradual
   rise in toxicity when shellfish accumulated more A. minutum. However,
   muscle and siphon are intermittently toxic both in exposure and
   depuration period in laboratory cultured purple clams. PSP toxins were
   detected in outdoor cultured purple clams, whereas no A. minutum were
   found in the culture pond during most of the survey time. The outdoor
   cultured purple clams need longer time to decrease toxicity to allowable
   levels than laboratory cultured purple clams. It was shown that
   laboratory data may not predict times over which pond-cultured purple
   clams may prove toxic to consumers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {Understanding the risks of co-exposures in a changing world: a case
   study of dual monitoring of the biotoxin domoic acid and Vibrio
   spp. in Pacific oyster},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {196},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Assessing the co-occurrence of multiple health risk factors in coastal
   ecosystems is challenging due to the complexity of multi-factor
   interactions and limited availability of simultaneously collected data.
   Understanding co-occurrence is particularly important for risk factors
   that may be associated with, or occur in similar environmental
   conditions. In marine ecosystems, the co-occurrence of harmful algal
   bloom toxins and bacterial pathogens within the genus Vibrio may impact
   both ecosystem and human health. This study examined the co-occurrence
   of Vibrio spp. and domoic acid (DA) produced by the harmful algae
   Pseudo-nitzschia by (1) analyzing existing California Department of
   Public Health monitoring data for V. parahaemolyticus and DA in oysters;
   and (2) conducting a 1-year seasonal monitoring of these risk factors
   across two Southern California embayments. Existing public health
   monitoring efforts in the state were robust for individual risk factors;
   however, it was difficult to evaluate the co-occurrence of these risk
   factors in oysters due to low number of co-monitoring instances between
   2015 and 2020. Seasonal co-monitoring of DA and Vibrio spp. (V.
   vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus) at two embayments revealed the
   co-occurrence of these health risk factors in 35\% of sampled oysters in
   most seasons. Interestingly, both the overall detection frequency and
   co-occurrence of these risk factors were considerably less frequent in
   water samples. These findings may in part suggest the slow depuration of
   Vibrio spp. and DA in oysters as residual levels may be retained. This
   study expanded our understanding of the simultaneous presence of DA and
   Vibrio spp. in bivalves and demonstrates the feasibility of
   co-monitoring different risk factors from the same sample. Individual
   programs monitoring for different risk factors from the same sample
   matrix may consider combining efforts to reduce cost, streamline the
   process, and better understand the prevalence of co-occurring health
   risk factors.},

Abstract = {Toxin profiles were determined in phytoplankton cell concentrates and
   Greenshell Mussels (Perna canaliculus) exposed to a dinoflagellate bloom
   dominated by Dinophysis acuta and Protoceratium reticulatum, This was
   achieved by using a method for the simultaneous identification and
   quantification of a variety of micro-algal toxins by liquid
   chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray
   ionisation (+/-) and monitoring of daughter ions in multiple reaction
   modes. Plankton concentrates and shellfish contained high levels of
   yessotoxins (YTXs) and pectenotoxins (PTXs) and low levels of okadaic
   acid (OA). A high proportion (> 87\%) of the OA in both plankton and
   shellfish was released by alkaline hydrolysis. An isomer of pectenotoxin
   1 (PTX1i) was nearly as abundant as pectenotoxin 2 (PTX2) in the
   plankton and shellfish, and the latter contained high levels of their
   respective seco acids. DTX1 DTX2, and PTX6 were not detected. MS-MS
   experiments revealed that the shellfish contained several other
   oxygenated metabolites of YTX in addition to 45-hydroxy yessotoxin
   (45OH-YTX). Gymnodimine (GYM) was present in the shellfish but not
   plankton and it was probably the residue from a previous GYM
   contamination event. Unlike the other toxins, GYM was concentrated in
   tissues outside the digestive gland and levels did not decrease over 5
   months. The depuration rates of YTX and PTXs from mussels were modelled.

Title = {Bioaccumulation and depuration of brevetoxins in the eastern oyster

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {75-81},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and northern quahog (= hard
   clam, Mercenaria mercenaria) are two species of economic and ecological
   significance in east coast waters of the United States and the Gulf of
   Mexico. Commercial industries for these species, especially within the
   state of Florida, are significant. The current study was undertaken to
   build upon the already established body of knowledge surrounding effects
   of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on shellfish, to provide an
   understanding of the kinetics of brevetoxins within shellfish tissues,
   and to provide an estimate of brevetoxin retention times in these
   shellfish after a bloom event.
   Individual clams and oysters were exposed to the toxic dinoflagellate,
   K. brevis at a bloom concentration of 5 x 10(5) cells.L-1 for eight days
   and then transferred to filtered water for depuration. Individuals were
   sampled periodically to determine depuration rates. Concentrations of
   brevetoxins (and/or their metabolites measured as PbTx-3 equivalent) in
   tissues were determined using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay
   (ELISA). After five days of exposure, brevetoxin levels in tissues of
   both species reached concentrations well above the regulatory limit of
   800 ng g(-1) (Pb-TX3 equivalent). Averaged concentration of brevetoxins
   in clams was 1000 ng g(-1), while the oysters averaged 1986 ng g(-1).
   After two weeks of depuration, tissue concentrations in both species
   were below regulatory levels with clams averaging similar to 204 ng
   g(-1) and oysters averaging similar to 437 ng g(-1). Toxins (or their
   metabolities) remained detectable in both clams (139 days) and oysters
   (82 days) for the duration of the experiment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Clearance rates and toxin accumulation by North Atlantic bivalves during
   harmful algal blooms caused by the dinoflagellate, Dinophysis
   acuminata, in estuaries},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is the intoxication syndrome
   derived from the consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins
   produced by algae such as Dinophysis acuminata, yet no study has
   examined the rate at which bivalves feed on this toxigenic species.
   During 2021 and 2022, the clearance rates (CR) of three commercially
   significant bivalve species native to the western North Atlantic
   (Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mytilus edulis) were
   quantified during exposure to D. acuminata blooms of varying densities
   (10(2) - 10(5) cells L-1) at three sites across New York (NY), USA. The
   same bivalve species were deployed at NY sites experiencing Dinophysis
   blooms to track accumulation and depuration rates of diarrhetic
   shellfish toxins (DSTs) and pectenotoxins (PTXs), toxins that are
   harmful to humans or shellfish, respectively. A native, non-commercial
   mussel species (Geukensis demissa) was also sampled in situ to quantify
   toxin accumulation. CR of D. acuminata were greater than
   chlorophyll-a-based-rates for all bivalves and clearance rates of D.
   acuminata by C. virginica (1.69 +/- 1.34 L h(-1) g(-1)) were
   significantly greater than those of M. edulis (0.46 +/- 0.32 L h(-1)
   g(-1)) and M. mercenaria (0.41 +/- 0.24 L h(-1) g(-1); p < 0.05). During
   a bloom event in 2021, C. virginica and M. mercenaria accumulated low
   levels of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), whereas during a more sustained bloom
   in 2022, C. virginica, M. edulis, and G. demissa accumulated
   combinations of DSTs (okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1)),
   PTX2, and pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (PTX2sa) with M. edulis DST loads
   (265 ng OA + DTX1 g(-1) shellfish tissue) exceeding the FDA closure
   guideline (160 ng toxin g(-1)) for three weeks. DST concentrations in M.
   edulis were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than C. virginica and M.
   mercenaria, whereas PTX2 concentrations in C. virginica were
   significantly higher than in all other bivalves (p < 0.05). PTX2sa loads
   in M. edulis and C. virginica were similar to each other and were
   significantly greater than PTX2 loads (p < 0.05). Toxin accumulation
   efficiencies (TAEs) were higher for M. edulis than C. virginica, and
   TAEs for DSTs were higher than for PTX2 and PTX2sa in both species. The
   combination of rapid CR of D. acuminata observed in all bivalves, even
   at >10(5) cells L-1, and the ability of bivalves such as M. edulis to
   rapidly accumulate high levels of DSTs demonstrate these HABs may
   represent a significant DSP threat in North America.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {465},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {It is still limited that how the microalgal toxin okadaic acid (OA)
   affects the intestinal microbiota in marine fishes. In the present
   study, adult marine medaka Oryzias melastigma was exposed to the
   environmentally relevant concentration of OA (5 mu g/L) for 10 days, and
   then recovered in fresh seawater for 10-days depuration. Analysis of
   taxonomic composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota, as
   well as function prediction analysis and histology observation were
   carried out in this study. Functional prediction analysis indicated that
   OA potentially affected the development of colorectal cancer, protein
   and carbohydrate digestion and absorption functions, and development of
   neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, which may be
   associated with changes in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in marine
   medaka. Significant increases of C-reactive protein (CRP) and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, as well as the changes of histology
   of intestinal tissue demonstrated that an intestinal inflammation was
   induced by OA exposure in marine medaka. This study showed that the
   environmental concentrations of OA could harm to the intestinal
   microbiota thus threatening the health of marine medaka, which hints
   that the chemical ecology of microalgal toxins should be paid attention
   to in future studies.},

Title = {Bacterial degradation of paralytic shellfish toxins},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-100},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bacteria isolated from the digestive tracts of blue mussels (Mytilus
   edulis) contaminated with paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were
   screened for the ability to reduce the toxicity of a PST mixture in
   vitro. Bacteria were isolated on marine agar and grown in marine broth
   supplemented with a mussel extract and an algal extract containing PSTs
   (saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, gonyautoxins 2 and 3, decarbamoyl-gonyautoxins
   2 and 3 and C1/C2 toxins). Toxin levels were measured before and after 5
   d of incubation, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   reduction of overall toxicity verified by mouse bioassays. Of the 73
   bacterial cultures screened, seven isolates were designated
   ``competent{''} PST degraders, individually reducing the overall
   toxicity of the PSTs by at least 90\% within 3 d. Most isolates degraded
   100\% of the saxitoxin and neosaxitoxin within 1-3 d. In all cases, the
   overall kinetics of degradation of the toxicities was first order, as
   were the individual degradation kinetics of most of the individual
   toxins. This is the first report of nearly complete elimination of PSTs
   through bacterial action and may perhaps result in the development of a
   practical means to eliminate or reduce the risk of PSP intoxication
   associated with shellfish consumption. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Microcystin contamination of shellfish along the freshwater-to-marine
   continuum within US mid-Atlantic and Northeast estuaries},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {145},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems that are an important habitat for
   bivalves. The freshwater bodies that discharge into estuaries can
   introduce cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins that may accumulate within food
   webs. Microcystin is a hepatotoxin that causes adverse health effects in
   humans and can be harmful to terrestrial and aquatic organisms.
   Microcystin has been detected in marine bivalves and the rate of
   microcystin accumulation and depuration differs between bivalve species.
   No study has explored the presence or dynamics of microcystins in
   bivalves in the Northeast US, where they represent a major fishery. This
   study quantified levels of microcystins in wild and cultured bivalves as
   a time series from 2017 to 2021 in three of the largest US East Coast
   estuaries (Chesapeake Bay, the Hudson River Estuary, and Long Island
   Sound) that have hosted microcystin-producing cyanobacterial harmful
   algal blooms (CHABs) within their watersheds. During this study,
   microcystins were rarely detected in bivalves across Chesapeake Bay but
   were commonly quantified in multiple bivalve species in the Hudson River
   estuary and within two harbors of Long Island Sound, Stony Brook Harbor
   and Conscience Bay. Microcystins were detected in clams (Mercenaria
   mercenaria and Corbicula fluminea), Eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica), and mussels (Mytilus edulis and Geukensia demissa). Eastern
   oysters (C. virginica) had significantly higher levels of microcystin
   than other bivalve species (p < 0.05) and often contained microcystin
   even when other bivalves sampled concurrently did not, suggesting
   oysters may be a vector for hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning in
   estuaries. Microcystins were detected in oysters even in fall months
   after water column cyanobacterial biomass and microcystins had decreased
   to low levels, suggesting toxin depuration slows during colder months.
   Collectively, this study demonstrates that microcystin accumulation in
   estuarine bivalves, particularly Eastern oysters (C. virginica), occurs
   within several of the larger US East Coast estuaries and could represent
   a public health risk.},

   phenomena known as neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (due to brevetoxins),

   conjugation to protein to create complete antigen, animal immunization
   and antibody isolation, and specific antibody subpopulation
   purification, discriminating antibodies have been isolated that detect

   of tools has been created for the study of polyether ladder toxin
   accumulation; depuration; and specific site localization in tissues,
   food sources, and clinical samples, Developed test protocols can detect
   toxin in dinoflagellate cells, in extracts from food sources, in
   seawater and culture media, and in human serum samples, Enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay protocols developed for eventual collaborative
   testing have been successful in limited applications within the

Title = {Variability and profiles of lipophilic toxins in bivalves from Great
   Britain during five and a half years of monitoring: azaspiracids and
   yessotoxins},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {87},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cefas has been responsible for the delivery of official control biotoxin
   testing of bivalve molluscs from Great Britain for just over a decade.
   Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) methodology
   has been used for the quantitation of lipophilic toxins (LTs) since
   2011. The temporal and spatial distribution of okadaic acid group toxins
   and profiles in bivalves between 2011 and 2016 have been recently
   reported. Here we present data on the two other groups of regulated
   lipophilic toxins, azaspiracids (AZAs) and yessotoxins (YTXs), over the
   same period. The latter group has also been investigated for a potential
   link with Protoceratium reticulatum and Lingulodinium polyedra, both
   previously recognised as YTXs producing phytoplankton.
   On average, AZAs were quantified in 3.2\% of all tested samples but
   notable inter-annual variation in abundance was observed. The majority
   of all AZA contaminated samples were found between July 2011 and August
   2013 in Scotland, while only two, three-month long, AZA events were
   observed in 2015 and 2016 in the south-west of England. Maximum
   concentrations were generally reached in late summer or early autumn.
   Reasons for AZAs persistence during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 winters
   are discussed. Only one toxin profile was identified, represented by
   both AZA1 and AZA2 toxins at an approximate ratio of 2 : 1, suggesting a
   single microalgal species was the source of AZAs in British bivalves.
   Although AZA1 was always the most dominant toxin, its proportion varied
   between mussels, Pacific oysters and surf clams.
   The YTXs were the least represented group among regulated LTs. YTXs were
   found almost exclusively on the south-west coast of Scotland, with the
   exception of 2013, when the majority of contaminated samples originated
   from the Shetland Islands. The highest levels were recorded in the
   summer months and followed a spike in Protoceratium reticulatum cell
   densities. YTX was the most dominant toxin in shellfish, further
   strengthening the link to P. reticulatum as the YTX source. Neither
   homo-YTX, nor 45 - OH homo-YTX were detected throughout the monitored
   period. 45 -OH YTX, thought to be a shellfish metabolite associated with
   YTX elimination, contributed on average 26\% in mussels. Although the
   correlation between 45-OH YTX abundance and the speed of YTX depuration
   could not be confirmed, we noted the half-life of YTX was more than
   two-times longer in queen scallops, which contained 100\% YTX, than in
   mussels. No other bivalve species were affected by YTXs.
   This is the first detailed evaluation of AZAs and YTXs occurrences and
   their profiles in shellfish from Great Britain over a period of multiple
   years.},

Abstract = {There is only limited information about the accumulation of algal toxins
   in aquatic organisms in the Baltic Sea. In this study we measured total
   cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels in blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and
   flounderi (Platichthys flesus) tissues. Flounder were caught with
   gillnets from the western Gulf of Finland during July and August 1999.
   Blue mussels were collected from an enclosure at 3 m depth and from an
   artificial reef (wreck, 25-35 m depth) in the western Gulf of Finland
   between June and September 1999. Flounder liver and muscle samples and
   soft tissues of mussels were analyzed for the cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins (nodularin, NODLN and/or microcystins, MCs) using an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed a
   time-dependent accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder and mussels. In
   flounder, the maximum concentration 399 +/- 5 (sd) ng NODLN or MC/g dry
   weight (dw) was found in the liver of specimens caught on 21 August
   1999. No hepatotoxins were detected in muscle samples. The maximum
   concentration of 2150 ng +/- 60 (sd) ng hepatotoxin/g dw was found in
   the mussel soft tissues collected on 20 August 1999. Temporal NODLN or
   MC trends indicated depuration of cyanobacterial hepatotoxin from
   mussels at surface level and an increase in NODLN or MC concentrations
   in those from the sea bed. These studies showed that despite the low
   cyanobacteria cell numbers the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins can
   accumulate in flounder and mussels. This may allow the further transfer
   of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins in the food web. (C) 2001 by John Wiley

Abstract = {The time course of several outbreaks of the diarrhetic shellfish
   poisoning (DSP) producer Dinophysis actuminata and the consequent
   kinetic of accumulation and loss of toxins in mussels Mytilus
   gailoprovincialis feeding on them was studied. Samples of mussels and
   seawater were frequently (2-3 times a week) collected from a raft in the
   Ria de Vigo. DSP toxins content of mussels and water was analyzed by
   HPLC-FD and phytoplankton was quantified in an inverted light
   microscope. Only okadaic acid (OA) and some of its conjugated forms (OA
   CF), estimated by enzymatic hydrolysis, were found in the plankton
   samples obtained, comprised mainly of D. acuminata cells. The main
   accumulated form in mussels was OA reaching a maximum of 10.1 mug OA
   g(-1) in the digestive gland (d.g.) in 16 days, falling below the
   quarantine level (ca. 2 mug OA g(-1) d.g.) by 45 days. The low polarity
   conjugated forms (LPCF), estimated by hexane extraction, accounted for
   6.2\% of the total toxin burden of the mussels. To quantify the rates of
   the processes involved in the accumulation, transformation and loss of
   the toxins, two dynamic models, a one-compartment and a two-compartment,
   including OA and its conjugated forms as variables were designed and
   implemented. The one-compartment model provided a good fit to the OA and
   LPCF actual data (r(2) = 0.92 and r(2) = 0.94, respectively). The
   two-compartment model did not fit the data markedly better than its
   one-compartment counterpart (r(2) = 0.93 and r(2) = 0.95, for OA and
   LPCF, respectively). High hydrolysis rates were estimated for most of
   the OA CF, which means that these forms came largely from the ingested
   plankton. The low estimated acylation rates support the previous point
   and suggest that the formation of LPCF by direct acylation of the OA is
   of little importance in M. galloprovincialis. Only in cases where the
   intoxication period is very long, can the formed acyl-derivatives be
   important, because they seem to accumulate for a long time in the
   mussels, as suggested by the low hydrolysis and depuration rates
   estimated from model fitting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Critical Review and Conceptual and Quantitative Models for the Transfer
   and Depuration of Ciguatoxins in Fishes},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We review and develop conceptual models for the bio-transfer of
   ciguatoxins in food chains for Platypus Bay and the Great Barrier Reef
   on the east coast of Australia. Platypus Bay is unique in repeatedly
   producing ciguateric fishes in Australia, with ciguatoxins produced by
   benthic dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus spp.) growing epiphytically on
   free-living, benthic macroalgae. The Gambierdiscus are consumed by
   invertebrates living within the macroalgae, which are preyed upon by
   small carnivorous fishes, which are then preyed upon by Spanish mackerel
   (Scomberomorus commerson). We hypothesise that Gambierdiscus and/or
   Fukuyoa species growing on turf algae are the main source of ciguatoxins
   entering marine food chains to cause ciguatera on the Great Barrier
   Reef. The abundance of surgeonfish that feed on turf algae may act as a
   feedback mechanism controlling the flow of ciguatoxins through this
   marine food chain. If this hypothesis is broadly applicable, then a
   reduction in herbivory from overharvesting of herbivores could lead to
   increases in ciguatera by concentrating ciguatoxins through the
   remaining, smaller population of herbivores. Modelling the dilution of
   ciguatoxins by somatic growth in Spanish mackerel and coral trout
   (Plectropomus leopardus) revealed that growth could not significantly
   reduce the toxicity of fish flesh, except in young fast-growing fishes
   or legal-sized fishes contaminated with low levels of ciguatoxins. If
   Spanish mackerel along the east coast of Australia can depurate
   ciguatoxins, it is most likely with a half-life of <= 1-year. Our review
   and conceptual models can aid management and research of ciguatera in
   Australia, and globally.},

Volume = {54},

Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTXs), produced by toxic benthic dinoflagellates, can
   bioaccumulate in marine organisms at higher trophic levels. The current
   study evaluated the uptake and depuration kinetics of some of the most
   potent CTXs, Pacific CTX-1, -2, and -3 (P-CTX-1, -2, and -3), in
   orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) exposed to 1 ng P-CTXs
   g(-1) fish daily. Over a 30 d exposure, P-CTX-1, -2, and -3 were
   consistently detected in various tissues of exposed fish, and the
   concentrations of the total P-CTXs in tissues generally ranked following
   the order of liver, intestine, gill, skin, brain, and muscle. Relatively
   higher uptake rates of P-CTX-1 in the groupers were observed compared
   with those of P-CTX-2 and -3. The depuration rate constants of P- CTX-1,
   -2, and -3 in different tissues were (0.996-16.5) X 10(-2), (1.51 16.1)
   X 10(-2), and (0.557-10.6) X 10(-2) d(-1), respectively. The
   accumulation efficiencies of P-CTX-1, -2, and -3 in whole groupers were
   6.13\%, 2.61\%, and 1.15\%, respectively. The increasing proportion of
   P-CTX-1 and the decreasing proportion of P-CTX-2 and -3 over the
   exposure phase suggest a likely biotransformation of P-CTX-2 and -3 to
   P-CTX-1, leading to higher levels of P-CTX-1 in fish and possibly a
   higher risk of CTXs in long-term exposed fish.},

Title = {Application of Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) for field
   detection of the hydrophilic phycotoxins domoic acid and saxitoxin in
   coastal California},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {645-660},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent publications have identified the analysis of phycotoxins in
   sentinel shellfish as a problematic tool for environmental monitoring
   purposes. Domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin produced by some species of the
   diatom Pseudo-nitzschia, can remain undetected in sentinel shellfish
   stocks during toxic blooms and subsequent marine bird and mammal mass
   mortality events. Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) has
   previously been described for monitoring of lipophilic toxins, whereas
   resin-based sampling methods are routinely employed for many other
   environmental contaminants. Here, we evaluate the applicability of SPATT
   for monitoring the hydrophilic phycotoxin DA and demonstrate that the
   same field sampling methods can be used for the detection of saxitoxins.
   We present laboratory-based adsorption profiles characterizing the
   performance of SPATT with four resin types: (1) HP20, (2) SP700, (3)
   SP207, and (4) SP207SS. We present results from 17 mo of approximately
   weekly SPATT deployments in Monterey Bay, California (USA); this period
   included two significant toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events as well
   as low-level saxitoxin events. SPATT signaled the presence of DA 3 and 7
   weeks before the recognition of bloom conditions by traditional
   monitoring techniques (7 and 8 weeks before shellfish toxicity). Under
   ambient (non-bloom) conditions, all resins detected DA when its presence
   was not apparent from traditional monitoring, highlighting the ubiquity
   of low level or transient toxin events in the environment. This study is
   the first to evaluate SPATT deployments in U. S. waters, and the first
   to demonstrate the applicability of SPATT toward detection of
   hydrophilic phycotoxins in the field.},

Title = {Paralytic shellfish toxins in zooplankton, mussels, lobsters and caged

Abstract = {Substantial mortalities of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) at two
   aquaculture sites in Long Island Sound, off Grand Manan Island, Bay of
   Fundy (BoF) (New Brunswick, Canada) in September 2003, were associated
   with a bloom of Alexandrium fundyense (>3 x 10(5) cells L-1), a
   dinoflagellate alga that produces toxins which cause paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (PSP). Cells of A. fundyense collected from surface waters
   while fish were dying had total paralytic shellfish (PS) toxin
   concentrations of 70.6 pg STX equiv. (saxitoxin equivalents) cell(-1)
   and PS toxin profiles rich in carbarnate toxins (78.2\%). The
   zooplankton sampled contained PS toxins (63.1 pg STX equiv. g(-1) wet
   wt) and the toxin profile matched that of A. fundyense cells.
   Mean PS toxin levels were low (<4 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt) in
   stomach, gill and muscle tissues of moribund salmon, suggesting that PS
   toxins are very lethal to salmon.
   The PS toxin concentrations in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) growing on
   the salmon cages (37; 526 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt) were the
   highest recorded to date from this region. Their PS toxin profiles
   showed enhanced carbarnate contents (85.5\%) compared with that found in
   A. fundyense. Blue mussels collected from an adjacent Canadian Food
   Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitoring site in Grand Manan had PS toxin
   concentrations of 4214 and 150 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt in late
   September and December, respectively, well above the regulatory limit
   (RL), and horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus) collected in late September
   had PS toxin concentrations of 2357 mu g STX equiv. 100 g(-1) wet wt.
   Detoxification under laboratory conditions suggested that blue mussels
   may require up to 19 weeks for elimination below RL when they accumulate
   these high concentrations of PS toxins. This depuration period may be
   shorter in the field.
   PS toxin levels above RL were detected in hepatopancreatic tissues of
   lobster (Homarus americanus), with lower levels (< 16 mu g STX equiv.
   100 g(-1) wet wt) in tail muscle and gills.
   These results illustrate the movement of PS toxins through the marine
   food chain following an A. fundyense bloom in the BoF, and support
   earlier studies suggesting that kills from the region of
   zooplanktivorous fish, such as herring (Clupea harengus harengus), can
   be attributed to blooms of A. fundyense. This is the first reported
   incident of PSP associated with mortalities of caged Atlantic salmon in
   the BoF Analyses of muscle tissues and viscera from the affected salmon
   indicated that any portion would not be a health hazard if consumed.

Abstract = {A seafood poisoning event occurred in Qinhuangdao, China, in April 2016.
   Subsequently, the causative mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were
   harvested and analyzed to reveal a high concentration {[}similar to 10
   758 mu g of saxitoxin (STX) equiv kg(-1)] of paralytic shellfish toxins
   (PSTs), including gonyautoxin (GTX)1/4 and GTX2/3, as well as new
   metabolites 11-hydroxy-STX (M2), 11,11-dihydroxy-STX (M4), open-ring
   11,11-dihydroxy-STX (M6), 11-hydroxy-neosaxitoxin (NEO) (M8), and
   11,11dihydroxy-NEO (M10). To understand the origin and biotransformation
   pathways of these new metabolites, uncontaminated mussels (M.
   galloprovincialis) were fed with either of two Alexandrium tamarense
   strains (ATHK and TIO108) under laboratory conditions. Similar PST
   metabolites were also detected in mussels from both feeding experiments.
   Results supposed that 11hydroxy-C2 toxin (Ml) and 11,11-dihydroxy-C2
   (M3) are transformed from C2, while 11-hydroxy-C4 toxin (M7) and
   11,11dihydroxy-C4 (M9) are converted from C4. In addition, the
   metabolites M2, M4, and M6 appear to be products of GTX2/3, and the
   metabolites M8 and M10 are likely derived from GTX1/4.},

Abstract = {Bivalve molluscs can acquire diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins
   via ingestion of toxigenic dinoflagellates. The dynamics and fate of DSP
   toxins were investigated in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians exposed
   to cells of the epibenthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, a known
   producer of DSP toxins, in controlled laboratory microcosms. Toxin
   parameters determined were uptake and detoxification rates, and
   anatomical compartmentalization. Toxins in tissue and algal extracts
   were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). No
   mortalities occurred and feeding inhibition was not observed for
   juvenile and adult bay scallops during the 2 wk exposure to P, lima
   cells. Clearance rates were similar for scallops exposed to equivalent
   biovolume cell concentrations of toxigenic P. lima and the non-toxic
   diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii; however, absorption efficiency of
   organic matter was significantly lower with a diet of P. Lima than T.
   weissflogii, Although DSP toxin concentrations in viscera of bay scallop
   exceeded commonly accepted regulatory levels (0.2 mug g(-1) whole
   tissue) within 24 h of exposure to P. lima, after 2 wk of exposure total
   DSP toxin retained in scallop tissues was <1 \% of the total toxin
   ingested over the same period. Most of the total toxin body burden was
   in the viscera (76 \%); however, in adult scallops a significant portion
   was associated with gonadal tissue (12 \%). Toxin levels were relatively
   low in gill, mantle and adductor tissue (< 12\% of total toxin body
   burden). During the depuration period, rapid release of DSP toxins from
   scallops indicated that toxins were poorly bound to all tissues, with
   the exception of the viscera. Detoxification of viscera consisted of a
   rapid loss of weakly bound toxin components within the initial 3 d of
   depuration, followed by a much slower release of the remaining toxin at
   a rate of 8.4 \% d(-1).},

Abstract = {During the summer of 2002 there were several episodes of human
   intoxication after consumption of brown crabs (Cancer pagurus) caught
   along the Norwegian south coast. The toxic agent was one of the
   well-known phycotoxins, the diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning (DSP)
   complex, routinely found in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). This toxin
   has not previously been documented in brown crabs. The route and rate of
   toxin accumulation as well as the rate of toxin depuration in crabs were
   determined in laboratory experiments. The DSP toxins only accumulate in
   digestive organs (hepatopancreas, HP) in the crabs. When fed with blue
   mussels containing more than 1000 mug of okadaic acid equivalents
   kg(-1), the crabs accumulated 3-30\% of the toxin. After 2 weeks, the
   average toxin level in the crabs exceeded the preliminary limit of DSP
   toxins at 400 mug okadaic acid equivalents kg(-1) HP established by the
   Norwegian Food Safety Authority. A 50\% reduction in toxin level was
   observed after 14-18 days when the crabs were fed fish instead of toxic
   mussels.},

Title = {Yessotoxins in Norwegian blue mussels (Mytilus edulis):: uptake
   from Protoceratium reticulatum, metabolism and depuration},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-272},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The Protoceratium reticulatum cell density at Flodevigen reached a
   maximum of 2200 cells/L on 16 May 2001. The levels of yessotoxins (YTXs)
   in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at the same site increased sharply by
   14 May and peaked on 28 May, after which they steadily declined. No
   other algal species present showed a similar pattern of correspondence.
   Together with the recent finding that Norwegian strains of P.
   reticulatum produce YTXs, these results indicate that P. reticulatum
   causes yessotoxin (YTX) contamination of shellfish in Norway, and that
   only relatively low cell densities are necessary for this to occur. The
   mussels from Flodevigen were analyzed by LC-MS for YTX, 45-hydroxyYTX,
   carboxyYTX, and a new yessotoxin believed to be 45-hydroxycarboxyYTX,
   and by ELISA for YTXs. The seasonal variations in toxin content versus
   time measured by the two methods were qualitatively very similar,
   although the response in the ELISA was 3-9 times higher due to the
   antibodies detecting other YTXs that were not detected by the LC-MS
   method. Changes in the LGMS profile for YTXs, and in the ratio of YTXs
   by LC-MS to YTXs by ELISA with time, were consistent with extensive
   metabolism of YTX in the mussels. Kinetic analysis of the LC-MS data
   showed an initial half-life of 20 days for YTX, and for YTX +
   45-hydroxyYTX, in the mussels. Similar analysis of the ELISA data gave a
   half-life of 24 days for YTXs. The depuration rate remained consistent
   over a 3-month period during which the temperature remained at 13-16
   degreesC. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Clearance rates and diarrhetic shellfish toxin accumulation by North
   Atlantic bivalves fed on North American strains of Dinophysis
   acuminata},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {213},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Filter feeding bivalves exposed to the harmful algal bloom (HAB) genus,
   Dinophysis, become intoxicated by the uptake of diarrhetic shellfish
   toxins (DSTs) produced by these phytoplankton. Here, three species of
   bivalve (Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mytilus
   edulis) native to the western North Atlantic were exposed to two North
   American strains of toxigenic Dinophysis acuminata to assess the impacts
   of cell density, cell density as a fraction of the total plankton
   community, and differing Dinophysis prey (i.e. strains of the ciliate,
   Mesodinium rubrum) on bivalve clearance rates. All bivalves cleared D.
   acuminata faster when the dinoflagellate was offered at moderate
   densities (10,000 cells L-1) as compared to high densities (100,000
   cells L-1). C. virginica cleared a more toxic Massachusetts strain of D.
   acuminata significantly faster than a less toxic New York strain (p <
   0.05). When presented with Dinophysis in mixed culture with the non-HAB
   species, Rhodomonas salina, in varying proportions, C. virginica
   clearance rates slowed significantly as the relative and absolute
   abundance of D. acuminata increased (p < 0.05), whereas M. edulis
   displayed a preference for the algae that was more abundant. While C.
   virginica and M. edulis cleared R. salina significantly faster than M.
   mercenaria (p < 0.05), there were no differences in the clearance rates
   of D. acuminata among bivalves. In an additional experiment where M.
   edulis was exposed to a constant, density (similar to 15,000 cells L-1)
   of D. acuminata for 36 h and then fed a non-toxic food source for 24 h
   to quantify toxin accumulation and depuration, mussels rapidly
   accumulated DSTs and pectenotoxins (PTXs) during exposure to Dinophysis
   but depurated PTXs at a rate 3-14 times faster than DSTs (p = 0.07).
   Collectively, this study demonstrates that the accumulation of DSTs in
   bivalves varies as a function of D. acuminata density, species, and
   strain, and that feeding characteristics of, and toxin dynamics within,
   M. edulis make it more vulnerable to DST accumulation than C. virginica
   and a likely DST vector in bloomprone regions.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are cyanobacterial toxins that can negatively impact
   human and animal health. This study investigated the bioaccumulation,
   transfer, depuration, and health risks of MCs in strawberry plants
   (Fragaria vulgaris) and Meriones shawi animals. The plants were
   irrigated with 1, 5, 10, and 20 mu g/L MCs for 60 days (bioaccumulation
   phase) and then with clean water for 30 days (depuration phase). The
   harvested plants (roots and leaves) were then prepared in an aliquot
   form and used as feed for Meriones shawi. Liquid chromatographymass
   spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used to measure MC concentrations in plant
   and animal tissues. The bioaccumulation of MCs was found to be highest
   in the roots, followed by leaves, fruits, liver, stomach, and fecal
   matter. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was highest in perlite (8.48),
   followed by roots (5.01), leaves (1.55), stomach (0.87), and fecal
   matter (1.18), indicating that the parts with high bioaccumulation
   factor had high translocation of MCs. The transfer of MCs to animal
   organs was low, and the daily toxin intake of adult consumers of
   strawberry fruit irrigated with 1, 5, 10, and 20 mu g/L MC did not
   exceed the WHO-recommended limit of 0.04 mu g MC-LR/Kg of bw/day.
   However, fruits from plants irrigated with 10 and 20 mu g/L may pose a
   moderate health risk to children (25 Kg bw), and Meriones' consumption
   of leaves may pose a significant health risk. After the depuration
   phase, MC concentration in perlite, roots, leaves, and fruits decreased,
   indicating that depuration reduced the danger of MC transmission and
   bioaccumulation. The study also found that glutathione reductase and
   glutathione S-transferase activity were essential in the depuration of
   MCs in the tested plants. The findings suggest that legislation
   regulating the quality of irrigation water in terms of MC concentrations
   is necessary to prevent detrimental consequences to crops and human
   exposure.},

Abstract = {Azaspiracids are a class of recently discovered algae-derived shellfish
   toxins. Their distribution globally is on the increase with mussels
   being most widely implicated in azaspiracid-related food poisoning
   events. Evidence that these toxins were bound to proteins in
   contaminated mussels has been shown recently. In the present study
   characterization of these proteins in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was
   achieved using a range of advanced proteomics tools. Four proteins
   present only in the hepatopancreas of toxin-contaminated mussels sharing
   identity or homology with cathepsin D, superoxide dismutase, glutathione
   S-transferase Pi, and a bacterial flagellar protein have been
   characterized. Several of the proteins are known to be involved in
   self-defense mechanisms against xenobiotics or up-regulated in the
   presence of carcinogenic agents. These findings would suggest that
   azaspiracids should now be considered and evaluated as potential
   tumorigenic compounds. The presence of a bacterial protein only in
   contaminated mussels was an unexpected finding and requires further
   investigation. The proteins identified in this study should assist with
   development of urgently required processes for the rapid depuration of
   azaspiracid-contaminated shellfish. Moreover they may serve as early
   warning indicators of shellfish exposed to this family of toxins.

Title = {Recent trends in paralytic shellfish toxins in Puget Sound,
   relationships to climate, and capacity for prediction of toxic events},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Temporal and spatial trends in paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in
   Puget Sound shellfish and their relationships with climate are
   investigated using long-term monitoring data since 1957. Data are
   selected for trend analyses based on the sensitivity of shellfish
   species to PSTs and their depuration rates, and the frequency of sample
   collection at individual sites. These criteria limit the analyses to the
   shellfish species Mytilus edulis at 20 sites from 1993 to 2007. Blue
   mussel toxicity is highly variable, but typically exceeds the regulatory
   limit for human consumption from July to November annually, with most
   closures occurring early in fall. Using blue mussel data only, we find
   no robust evidence to suggest that the frequency, magnitude, duration,
   or geographic scope of PST events in Puget Sound increased between 1993
   and 2007. However, there is a significant basin-wide trend for closures
   to occur earlier in the year. There are no significant correlations
   between annual indices of mussel toxicity and aspects of the local and
   large-scale climate. Case studies of daily variations in local
   environmental factors leading up to exceptionally toxic events identify
   a combination of conditions that generally precedes most closures from
   1993 to 2007. These results suggest that periods of warm air and water
   temperatures and low streamflow on sub-seasonal timescales may
   facilitate toxin accumulation in mussels. No relationships were found
   between water residence times in the surface layer and either streamflow
   or mussel toxicity. Recommendations are made for future monitoring to
   improve forecasting of PST risks in Puget Sound, an important region for
   recreational, commercial, and tribal subsistence shellfish harvesting.

Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are a major group of potent cyanobacterial toxins
   found in freshwater and even brackish waterbodies. To understand the
   putative correlation between bioconcentration of MCs and antioxidant
   responses of the digestive gland of bivalves, Pacific oyster Crassostrea
   gigas and blue mussel Mytilus edulis were exposed to different
   concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 and 20 mu g L-1) of MC-Leucine-Arginine (LR)
   for seven days. MC-LR bioconcentrated in the digestive glands of both
   bivalves during exposure period. The levels were slightly reduced when
   the bivalves were exposed to seawater during depuration (7 days), while
   approximately 0.1 mu g L-1 of MCLR was observed in the 10 and 20 mu g
   L-1 exposed bivalves at the end of depuration. Intracellular
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly
   elevated in the 10 and 20 mu g L-1 exposed bivalves at 7 day, and the
   levels were maintained during depuration in both bivalves. Overall,
   significant higher levels of enzymatic activities of antioxidant defense
   systems such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT),
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione
   reductase (GR) were observed in the 10 and 20 mu g L-1 exposed bivalves.
   Interestingly, most of higher levels of Pacific oyster were detected at
   exposure period, while blue mussel showed higher levels at depuration
   phase, suggesting a species-specific sensitivity upon MC-LR. These
   patterns were correlated with the bioconcentration patterns of MC-LR as
   Pacific oyster was highly accumulated by MC-LR during exposure period,
   but blue mussel showed prolonged high levels of MC-LR for depuration
   phase. Our results will be useful to understand species-specific
   bioconcentration of MC-LR in bivalves and their effects on intracellular
   oxidative status via accumulation.},

Abstract = {Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSPT) produced by certain harmful
   algal blooms (HABs) pose a serious threat to public health worldwide.
   Along the West coast of North America, Mytilus californianus (California
   sea mussel) has long been used as the primary indicator species for
   monitoring levels of PSPT in the environment. However, because the
   natural distribution of this species is limited to rocky shores, vast
   stretches of coastline bordered by sandy beach habitat are not regularly
   monitored for PSPT presence. This insufficient spatial coverage greatly
   reduces the ability to track and predict HAB development and movement
   along the open coast. Earlier studies on Emerita analoga (common mole or
   sand crab) demonstrated this species' potential to sequester the
   neurotoxin saxitoxin (STX) and its derivatives. The goals of this study
   were to (1) develop a practical and efficient PSPT extraction protocol
   for sand crabs, and (2) compare the utility and reliability of this
   species as an indicator of PSPT with that of mussels. Laboratory spike
   and recovery results showed that STX extraction efficiencies were very
   similar for both species. Field comparisons of natural accumulation and
   depuration rates of PSPT for the two species revealed that PSPT events
   detected using mussels were also identified with sand crabs. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms of toxin-producing microalgae are recurrent in
   southern Chile. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks pose the
   main threat to public health and the fishing industry in the Patagonian
   fjords. This study aims to increase understanding of the individual and
   spatial variability of PSP toxicity in the foot of Concholepas
   concholepas, Chile's most valuable commercial benthic invertebrate
   species, extracted from the Guaitecas Archipelago in Chilean Patagonia.
   The objective is to determine the effect of pigment removal and freezing
   during the detoxification process. A total of 150 specimens (>= 90 mm
   length) were collected from this area. The live specimens were
   transferred to a processing plant, where they were measured and gutted,
   the foot was divided into two equal parts, and pigment was manually
   removed from one of these parts. The PSP toxicity of each foot (edible
   tissue) was determined by mouse bioassay (MBA) and high-performance
   liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and postcolumn
   oxidation (HPLC-FLD PCOX). The individual toxicity per loco, as the
   species is known locally, varied from <30 to 146 mu g STX diHCL eq 100
   g(-1) (CV = 43.83\%) and from 5.96 to 216.3 mu g STX diHCL eq 100 g(-1)
   (CV = 34.63\%), using MBA and HPLC, respectively. A generalized linear
   model showed a negative relation between individual weight and toxicity.
   The toxicological profile showed a dominance of STX (>95\%), neoSTX and
   GTX2. The removal of pigment produced a reduction in PSP toxicity of up
   to 90\% and could represent a good detoxification tool moving forward.
   The freezing process in the muscle with pigment did not produce a clear
   pattern. There is a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of PSP toxicity via
   PCOX but not MBA. Furthermore, the study discusses possible management
   and commercialization implications of the findings regarding small-scale
   fisheries.},

Abstract = {The possibility and effectiveness of microencapsulation of okadaic acid
   (OA) in gelatin-acacia microcapsules has been studied. The encapsulation
   efficiency was higher than 33\%. The microcapsules were shown to be very
   stable, not leaching more than 9\% of the encapsulated OA in a 20-h
   period. OA from the microcapsules was absorbed by the mussels very
   efficiently, accumulating -after 3 days of feeding and one of
   depuration- 65\% of the OA in microcapsules and 22\% of the total OA
   used at the beginning of the microencapsulation process. These
   efficiencies and the possibility of encapsulating single DSP toxins and
   derivatives constitute a valuable tool for the study of the accumulation
   and biotransformation of DSP toxins in bivalves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessment of the sub-lethal impacts of Karenia brevis on
   hard clams, Mercenaria campechiensis},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {143},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Karenia brevis, a toxin-producing dinoflagellate, has been implicated in
   frequent harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Gulf of Mexico. Shellfish
   species, such as Mercenaria campechiensis, have high resilience to K.
   brevis exposure causing high accumulation and retention of brevetoxins
   within their tissues. The current study aimed to analyze the
   accumulation and depuration of brevetoxins in M. campechiensis exposed
   to 100,000 cells L-1 for two weeks. The second aim was to identify the
   potential detoxification enzymes in M. campechiensis as well as
   potential enzymes representative of stress to see if moderate
   concentrations lead to stress in exposed M. campechiensis. This was done
   by exposing M. campechiensis to a continuous flow of K. brevis, followed
   by a 47-day depuration period. There was an increase in brevetoxin
   concentration during the exposure with a rapid decrease at the onset of
   the depuration period. This was followed by a gradual decrease with
   detectable toxins in the exposed clam tissue for the duration of the
   experiment. While there was detectable toxin during the depurations, the
   concentrations were below the NSP level for BTX-2 by day 14 indicating
   M. campechiensis would potentially be safe for consumption after two
   weeks following exposure to a moderate K. brevis concentration. Fold
   change of AChE activity significantly increased in the exposure tank
   when compared to the controls following the exposure period. Fold change
   of GST activity from control significantly decreased in the exposure
   tank compared to the controls on 14 d exposure. Both changes in enzyme
   activity support the findings that a moderate concentration of K. brevis
   may induce stress in M. campechiensis. Ultimately, the results of the
   current study further highlight the importance of the K. brevis
   regulatory limits as it can prevent possible neurotoxic shellfish
   poisoning in people who eat contaminated shellfish as it prevents the
   consumption of shellfish exposed to moderate and high concentrations of
   K. brevis.},

Abstract = {Scallops (Pecten maximus) were contaminated experimentally by a toxic
   strain of the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense for subsequent
   study of paralytic phycotoxin distribution during depuration
   (detoxification by a nontoxic microalgal diet). The results confirm data
   in the literature concerning the high toxicity of the digestive gland,
   the similarity of its toxin profile to that of the vector alga, and the
   reduction in toxicity to one-third of its initial value after a 20-day
   decontamination period. Adductor muscle was only slightly contaminated
   (less than 50 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1) compared to initial digestive gland
   toxicity of 2,620 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1)), whereas gonad was more
   contaminated (41 to 148 mu g STX eq. 100 g(-1)), showing a gradual rise
   in toxicity apparently related to increased conversion of gonyautoxins
   into saxitoxin. The most striking results concerned kidney toxicity
   which was markedly higher than that of the digestive gland. The role of
   the kidneys in the biotransformation of gonyautoxins and the anatomical
   distribution of these compounds to other tissues are considered.},

Title = {Comparative study of domoic acid accumulation, isomer content and
   associated digestive subcellular processes in five marine invertebrate
   species},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite the deleterious effects of the phycotoxin domoic acid (DA) on
   human health, and the permanent threat of blooms of the toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia sp. over commercially important fishery-resources,
   knowledge regarding the physiological mechanisms behind the profound
   differences in accumulation and depuration of this toxin in contaminated
   invertebrates remain very scarce. In this work, a comparative analysis
   of accumulation, isomer content, and subcellular localization of DA in
   different invertebrate species was performed. Samples of scallops Pecten
   maximus and Aequipecten opercularis, clams Donax trunculus,
   slippersnails Crepidula fornicata, and seas-quirts Asterocarpa sp. were
   collected after blooms of the same concentration of toxic
   Pseudo-nitzschia australis. Differences (P < 0.05) in DA accumulation
   were found, wherein P. maximus showed up to 20-fold more DA in the
   digestive gland than the other species. Similar profiles of DA isomers
   were found between P. maximus and A. opercularis, whereas C. fornicata
   was the species with the highest biotransformation rate (-10 \%) and D.
   trunculus the lowest (-4 \%). DA localization by immunohistochemical
   analysis revealed differences (P < 0.05) between species: in P. maximus,
   DA was detected mainly within autophagosome-like vesicles in the
   cytoplasm of digestive cells, while in A. opercularis and C. fornicata
   significant DA immunoreactivity was found in post-autophagy residual
   bodies. A slight DA staining was found free within the cytoplasm of the
   digestive cells of D. trunculus and Asterocarpa sp. The Principal
   Component Analysis revealed similarities between pectinids, and a clear
   distinction of the rest of the species based on their capabilities to
   accumulate, biotransform, and distribute the toxin within their tissues.
   These findings contribute to improve the understanding of the
   inter-specific dif-ferences concerning the contamination-decontamination
   kinetics and the fate of DA in invertebrate species.},

Title = {Reviewing Evidence for Disturbance to Coral Reefs Increasing the Risk of
   Ciguatera},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {The hypothesis that disturbance to coral reefs creates new surfaces that
   increase the risk of ciguatera is premised upon the increased algal
   substrates that develop on these surfaces being colonised by high
   ciguatoxin (CTX)-producing Gambierdiscus species that proliferate and
   enter the ciguatera food chain. Current evidence indicates that new
   algal substrates are indeed rapidly colonised by Gambierdiscus. However,
   the requirement that these Gambierdiscus species include at least one
   that is a significant (high) CTX-producer is more likely a limiting
   step. While ambient environmental conditions impact the capacity of
   Gambierdiscus to bloom, factors that limit the growth of the bloom could
   influence (typically increase) the flux of CTX entering marine food
   chains. Additionally, new algal substrates on damaged reefs can be
   preferentially grazed to funnel ciguatoxins from Gambierdiscus to
   herbivores in disturbed reef areas. In societies consuming second
   trophic level species (herbivores, grazers, and detritivores), such
   funnelling of CTX would increase the risk of ciguatera, although such
   risk would be partially offset over time by growth (toxin-dilution) and
   depuration. Here, we review evidence for six potential mechanisms to
   increase ciguatera risk from disturbance to coral reefs and suggest a
   hypothesis where ecosystem changes could increase the flux of CTX to
   groupers through a shift in predation from predominately feeding on
   planktonic-feeding prey to mostly feeding on benthic-feeding prey,
   increasing the potential for CTX to accumulate. Evidence for this
   hypothesis is stronger for the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it may not
   apply to the Caribbean Sea/Atlantic Ocean.},

Title = {Effects of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella on the

Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {108},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The effects of harmful algae on bivalve physiology are complex and
   involve both physiological and behavioural responses. Studying those
   responses is essential to better describe and predict their impact on
   shellfish aqua culture and health risk for humans. In this study we
   recorded for two months the physiological response of the blue mussel
   Mytilus edulis from Eastern Canada to a one-week exposure to a paralytic
   shellfish poisoning producing dinoflagellate strain of Alexandrium
   catenella, isolated from the St Lawrence estuary, Canada. Mussels in a
   `control' treatment were fed continuously with a non-toxic diet, while
   mussels in a `starvation' treatment were fed the same non-toxic diet the
   first week and subsequently starved for seven weeks. Mussels in a
   `toxic' treatment received A. catenella for one week before being
   starved until the end of the experiment. Over a two month experiment we
   monitored shell and tissue growth, filtration capacity, respiration
   rate, byssal attachment strength, valve opening behaviour, and toxin
   content in tissues. Mussels fed normally on the toxic dinoflagellate and
   accumulated an average of 51.6 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1) after one week of
   exposure. After seven weeks of depuration, about half of the specimen
   showed levels around 18 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1). The condition index of
   exposed mussels ('toxic' treatment) decreased rapidly from the start as
   compared to mussels that received a one-week non-toxic diet
   ('starvation' treatment). Oxygen consumption rates increased in the
   `toxic' treatment before leveling out with that of mussels from the
   `starvation' treatment. Valve opening amplitude was lower in the `toxic'
   treatment during and following the exposure. Average valve closure
   duration was higher right after the exposure, during the peak of mussel
   tissue intoxication. No significant change in byssal thread strength was
   observed through time in each treatment but less force was required to
   detach mussels from the `toxic' and `starvation' treatments. The number
   of byssus threads produced by mussels exposed to the toxic
   dinoflagellate was also lower than in the control group. These results
   represent advancements in our understanding of the impacts of harmful
   algae on bivalves and contribute to the development of mitigation
   measures necessary to both the safety of consumers and the
   sustainability of aquaculture operations.},

Abstract = {Okadaic acid group (OA-group) is a set of lipophilic toxins which are
   characterised by being produced by species associated with the genera
   Dinophysis and Prorocentrum. OA-group has been regularly detected in
   endemic shellfish species from the southern zone of Chile only through
   the mouse bioassay. The purpose of this work was to determine the
   variability of OA-group toxins in endemic aquatic organisms (bivalves,
   crabs, gastropods and fish) and to establish the relationship with the
   concentration of fatty acids (FAs) detected in the evaluated species.
   The toxicity of OA-group and the FA profiles were determined using
   LC-MS/MS and gas chromatography with flame-ionisation detection,
   respectively. In the study area, the dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta was
   detected in densities approximate to 2000 cells ml(-1) with a toxicity
   approximate to 18.3pg OA equiv cel(-1). The analysis identified OA and
   dinophysistoxin-1 in shellfish in a range of approximate to 90 to
   approximate to 225g OA eq kg(-1), where no toxins in fish were detected.
   A positive relationship between the FA level and the concentration of
   OA-group toxins in the digestive glands of bivalves and gastropods was
   established, noted for high levels of saturated FAs (C14:0 and C16:0).
   The toxic variability of OA-group toxins determined in the different
   species allowed us to establish that the consumption of these vectors,
   regulated by non-analytical methods, can be harmful when consumed by
   humans, thus suggesting that the sanitary regulations for the control of
   OA-group in Chile should be updated.},

Title = {Origin of Ciguateric Fish: Quantitative Modelling of the Flow of
   Ciguatoxin through a Marine Food Chain},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To begin to understand the impact of food chain dynamics on ciguatera
   risk, we used published data to model the transfer of ciguatoxins across
   four trophic levels of a marine food chain in Platypus Bay, Australia.
   The data to support this first attempt to conceptualize the scale of
   each trophic transfer step was limited, resulting in broad estimates.
   The hypothetical scenario we explored generated a low-toxicity 10 kg
   Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) with a flesh concentration of
   0.1 mu g/kg of Pacific-ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1, also known as CTX1B) from
   19.5-78.1 mu g of P-CTX-1 equivalents (eq.) that enter the marine food
   chain from a population of 12-49 million benthic dinoflagellates
   (Gambierdiscus sp.) producing 1.6 x 10(-12) g/cell of the P-CTX-1
   precursor, P-CTX-4B. This number of Gambierdiscus could be epiphytic on
   22-88 kg of the benthic macroalgae (Cladophora) that carpets the bottom
   of much of Platypus Bay, with the toxin transferred to an estimated
   40,000-160,000 alpheid shrimps in the second trophic level. This large
   number of shrimps appears unrealistic, but toxic shrimps would likely be
   consumed by a school of small, blotched javelin fish (Pomadasys
   maculatus) at the third trophic level, reducing the number of shrimps
   consumed by each fish. The Spanish mackerel would accumulate a flesh
   concentration of 0.1 mu g/kg P-CTX-1 eq. by preying upon the school of
   blotched javelin and consuming 3.6-14.4 mu g of P-CTX-1 eq. However,
   published data indicate this burden of toxin could be accumulated by a
   10 kg Spanish mackerel from as few as one to three blotched javelin
   fish, suggesting that much greater amounts of toxin than modelled here
   must at certain times be produced and transferred through Platypus Bay
   food chains. This modelling highlights the need for better quantitative
   estimates of ciguatoxin production, biotransformation, and depuration
   through marine food chains to improve our understanding and management
   of ciguatera risk.},

Title = {Physiological and Metabolic Responses of Marine Mussels Exposed to Toxic
   Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum
   ovalisporum},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a major contaminant in inland aquatic
   ecosystems. Furthermore, toxic blooms are carried downstream by rivers
   and waterways to estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Concerning marine and
   estuarine animal species, very little is known about how these species
   are affected by the exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria and
   cyanotoxins. So far, most of the knowledge has been gathered from
   freshwater bivalve molluscs. This work aimed to infer the sensitivity of
   the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to single as well as mixed
   toxic cyanobacterial cultures and the underlying molecular responses
   mediated by toxic cyanobacteria. For this purpose, a mussel exposure
   experiment was outlined with two toxic cyanobacteria species,
   Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum ovalisporum at 1 x 10(5)
   cells/mL, resembling a natural cyanobacteria bloom. The estimated amount
   of toxins produced by M. aeruginosa and C. ovalisporum were respectively
   0.023 pg/cell of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and 7.854 pg/cell of
   cylindrospermopsin (CYN). After 15 days of exposure to single and mixed
   cyanobacteria, a depuration phase followed, during which mussels were
   fed only non-toxic microalga Parachlorella kessleri. The results showed
   that the marine mussel is able to filter toxic cyanobacteria at a rate
   equal or higher than the non-toxic microalga P. kessleri. Filtration
   rates observed after 15 days of feeding toxic microalgae were 1773.04
   mL/ind.h (for M. aeruginosa), 2151.83 mL/ind.h (for C. ovalisporum),
   1673.29 mL/ind.h (for the mixture of the 2 cyanobacteria) and 2539.25
   mL/ind.h (for the non-toxic P. kessleri). Filtering toxic microalgae in
   combination resulted in the accumulation of 14.17 ng/g dw MC-LR and
   92.08 ng/g dw CYN. Other physiological and biochemical endpoints (dry
   weight, byssus production, total protein and glycogen) measured in this
   work did not change significantly in the groups exposed to toxic
   cyanobacteria with regard to control group, suggesting that mussels were
   not affected with the toxic microalgae. Nevertheless, proteomics
   revealed changes in metabolism of mussels related to diet, specially
   evident in those fed on combined cyanobacteria. Changes in metabolic
   pathways related with protein folding and stabilization, cytoskeleton
   structure, and gene transcription/translation were observed after
   exposure and feeding toxic cyanobacteria. These changes occur in vital
   metabolic processes and may contribute to protect mussels from toxic
   effects of the toxins MC-LR and CYN.},

Abstract = {Cyanobacterial hepatotoxin accumulation in mussels (Mytilus edulis,
   Dreissena polymorpha), clam (Macoma balthica), and flounder (Platichthys
   flesus) tissues was measured. Flounder were caught with gillnets from
   the western Gulf of Finland on 21 August 1999, 25 July 2000, and 25
   August 2000. Blue mussels were collected from: (1) a steel cage at a
   depth of 3 m on 20 August 1999, (2) an enclosure at depths of 3-5 m, and
   (3) an artificial reef (wreck at 25-30 m) in the western Gulf of Finland
   between June and September 2000. Furthermore, blue mussels were
   collected from two sites between August and October 2000: south of the
   town of Hanko at depths of 5 and 20 m in the western Gulf of Finland and
   south of the city of Helsinki at a depth of 7 m in the central Gulf of
   Finland. M. balthica and D. polymorpha were collected at a depth of 12 m
   from Russian waters in the eastern Gulf of Finland on 1-4 August 2000.
   The samples were analyzed for the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins nodularin
   (NODLN) and microcystins (MCs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). ELISA indicated a time-dependent
   accumulation of hepatotoxins in flounder liver up to 400 +/- 10 (SD)
   mug/kg on 25 August 2000. No hepatotoxins were detected in flounder
   muscle samples. In blue mussels, collected from an enclosure 3-5 m deep
   in the western Gulf of Finland on 23 August 2000, ELISA indicated
   cyanobacterial hepatotoxins up to 1490 +/- 60 mug/kg dry wt. Blue
   mussels collected from the other sites contained less cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins (40-130 mug/kg dry wt). Clams and mussels from Russian
   waters contained cyanobacterial hepatotoxin at about 100-130 mug/kg dry
   wt. Total hepatotoxin levels in mussels from enclosures decreased from
   August to September, indicating at least partial detoxication/depuration
   of the toxins. LC-MS verified the presence of NODLN in mussels and
   flounder. Typical detoxication conjugates were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS
   in mussel samples collected during August 2000. In deeper-living wreck
   mussels cyanobacterial hepatotoxin levels continued to increase, from
   August to September, indicating that portions of cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins reach the sea floor. NODLN bioaccumulation is a constant
   phenomenon in the area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MC) produced by several cyanobacteria are potent
   hepatotoxins, whereas the toxicokinetics and subsequent detrimental
   effects ofMCare not fully understood in marine bivalves. In this study,
   the accumulation and depuration pattern of MC-Leucine-Arginine (MC-LR)
   along with the antioxidant response were investigated in the gill tissue
   of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and blue mussel Mytilus edulis
   exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 20 mg L-1 MC-LR for 7 days. Time-and
   concentration-dependent accumulation and depuration of MC-LR were
   observed in the gill tissue during the exposure and depuration phases.
   The values for maximum accumulation of MC-LR and malondialdehyde content
   were statistically significant (P < 0.05) at the end of exposure (day 7)
   to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR for both the bivalves, and at the beginning of the
   depuration period when M. edulis and C. gigas were exposed to 10 and 20
   mg L-1, respectively. A significant level of glutathione (GSH) was
   detected in M. edulis in response to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR during the exposure
   and depuration periods, whereas no significant levels of GSH were
   detected in C. gigas. The MC-LR accumulation induced oxidative stress in
   the gill tissue through modulation of the activities of antioxidant
   enzymes, the antioxidant response being more significant in the mussel
   than in the oyster. The enzymatic activities of glutathione
   S-transferase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and
   glutathione reductase (GR) increased significantly in M. edulis, whereas
   in C. gigas, significant increase in the activities of SOD, catalase,
   and GR were observed at the end of exposure (day 7) to 20 mg L-1 MC-LR.
   Similarly, during the depuration period, significant increases in the
   antioxidant activities were observed in M. edulis mostly at the
   beginning (day 1 and day 5) of exposure compared with the levels in C.
   gigas. The results obtained in this study will be useful in the
   understanding of MC-LR accumulation in bivalve gill tissues and the
   subsequent antioxidant defense response.},

Abstract = {Perna viridis is a recently introduced species to US coastal waters and
   have vigorously spread throughout the southeastern seaboard since their
   invasion. Little information regarding their response to local
   environmental factors has been reported including responses to the local
   HAB species, Karenia brevis. This study monitored the tissue toxin
   concentration of brevetoxins in P. viridis from existing populations
   throughout two consecutive natural K. brevis blooms. The results showed
   P. viridis to rapidly accumulate PbTx upon exposure to the bloom, far
   exceeding the peak tissue concentrations of oysters, Crassostrea
   virginica, sampled during the same period, 57,653 +/- 15,937 and 33,462
   +/- 10,391 ng g(-1) PbTx-3 equivalent, respectively. Further, P. viridis
   retained high PbTx concentrations in their tissues post bloom remaining
   above the regulatory limit for human consumption for 4-5 months,
   significantly longer than the depuration time of 2-8 weeks for native
   oyster and clam species. In the second year, the bloom persisted at high
   cell concentrations resulting in prolonged exposure and higher PbTx
   tissue concentrations indicating increased bioaccumulation in green
   mussels. While this species is not currently harvested for human
   consumption, the threat for post bloom trophic transfer could pose
   negative impacts on other important fisheries and higher food web
   implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The influence of size on domoic acid concentration in king scallop,

Abstract = {Concentrations of domoic acid (DA), the biotoxin responsible for amnesic
   shellfish poisoning (ASP), exceeding the regulatory limit of 20 mu g
   g(-1) have caused restricted harvesting and closures of wild king
   scallop fisheries. Toxin monitoring programmes have reported significant
   inter-animal variation in DA concentration between scallops from the
   same area. For the development of reliable sampling and management
   protocols an understanding of the magnitude and causes of inter-animal
   variation in toxin concentration are important. Ten samples were
   collected from an aquaculture site in Clew Bay, Co. Mayo off the west
   coast of Ireland between February 2003 and February 2004, each sample
   comprising 12 scallops of each of the following size groups: small
   (70-85 mm), medium (85-100 mm), large (100-115 mm) and very large (> 115
   mm). DA concentration in each hepatopancreas and in composite samples of
   both gonad and adductor muscle from each size group on each sampling
   occasion were measured. High inter-animal variability in DA
   concentration in hepatopancreas was recorded; CVs ranging from 12.5\% to
   82.5\%. One negative correlation (R-2 = 0.7079) between DA concentration
   in hepatopancreas and scallop shell length, three positive but weak
   correlations (R-2 = 0.4536, 0.3459 and 0.4665) and six no correlations
   were exhibited. Negative correlations were attributed to faster DA
   uptake by smaller scallops, positive correlations to faster DA
   depuration by smaller scallops. If only scallops greater than or equal
   to 100 mm shell length, the minimum commercial size of this species were
   considered, no correlation occurred on any of the 10 sampling occasions.

Volume = {9},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia, Eastern Mediterranean sea), the grooved
   carpet shell Ruditapes decussatus has been seen to contain persistent
   levels of gymnodimine (GYM) for several years. The present experimental
   work represents the first attempt to assess detoxification kinetics of
   fast-acting toxins (FAT) in marine molluscs fed specific diets of
   non-toxic algae (Isochrysis galbana).
   To find an optimal detoxification method, two experiments were performed
   in which clams were first fed the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia
   selliformis to artificially contaminate them with GYM, thus simulating
   the effect of natural toxic episodes. As a second step, the same clams
   were fed a non-toxic algae, I. galbana. to speed up the detoxification
   process.
   Changes in toxin content over the whole experiment were assessed by
   liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
   analysis.
   The first results revealed (i) faster detoxification rates in digestive
   gland (DG) when clams were fed on L galbana compared with a starved
   control (no food) and (ii) a typical detoxification pattern, i.e. a
   rapid drop in toxin content within the first days followed by a
   secondary slower decrease. GYM levels could be reduced approximately to
   less than 5\% within 7-8 days in clams fed I. galbana, according to the
   initial toxin levels of 1400 and 9400 mu g GYM/kg of DG, respectively.
   At the end of the second experiment, DSP mouse bioassay was negative
   when GYM was less than 100 mu g/kg DG. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Diversity and regional distribution of harmful algal events along the
   Atlantic margin of Europe},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Number = {SI},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The IOC-ICES-PICES Harmful Algal Event Database (HAEDAT) was used to
   describe the diversity and spatiotemporal distribution of harmful algal
   events along the Atlantic margin of Europe from 1987 -2018. The majority
   of events recorded are caused by Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DSTs).
   These events are recorded annually over a wide geographic area from
   southern Spain to northern Scotland and Iceland, and are responsible for
   annual closures of many shellfish harvesting areas. The dominant
   causative dinoflagellates, members of the morphospecies `Dinophysis
   acuminata complex' and D. acuta, are common in the waters of the
   majority of countries affected. There are regional differences in the
   causative species associated with PST events; the coasts of Spain and
   Portugal with the dinoflagellates Alexandrium minutum and Gymnodinium
   catenatum, north west France/south west England/south Ireland with A.
   minutum, and Scotland/Faroe Islands/Iceland with A. catenella. This can
   influence the duration and spatial scale of PST events as well as the
   toxicity of shellfish. The diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis is the most
   widespread Domoic Acid (DA) producer, with records coming from Spain,
   Portugal, France, Ireland and the UK. Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (ASTs)
   have caused prolonged closures for the scallop fishing industry due to
   the slow depuration rate of DA. Amendments to EU shellfish hygiene
   regulations introduced between 2002 and 2005 facilitated end-product
   testing and sale of adductor muscle. This reduced the impact of ASTs on
   the scallop fishing industry and thus the number of recorded HAEDAT
   events. Azaspiracids (AZAs) are the most recent toxin group responsible
   for events to be characterised in the ICES area. Events associated with
   AZAs have a discrete distribution with the majority recorded along the
   west coast of Ireland. Ciguatera Poisoning (CP) has been an emerging
   issue in the Canary Islands and Madeira since 2004. The majority of
   aquaculture and wild fish mortality events are associated with blooms of
   the dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi and raphidophyte Heterosigma
   akashiwo. Such fish killing events occur infrequently yet can cause
   significant mortalities. Interannual variability was observed in the
   annual number of HAEDAT areas with events associated with individual
   shellfish toxin groups. HABs represent a continued risk for the
   aquaculture industry along the Atlantic margin of Europe and should be
   accounted for when considering expansion of the industry or operational
   shifts to offshore areas.},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are naturally occurring algal toxins in the aquatic
   environment and pose a serious threat to the ecosystem. In general,
   aquatic populations are structured by organisms of different ages, with
   varying degrees of biochemical and physiological responses. In this
   study, juvenile and adult marine mysids (Neomysis awatschensis) were
   exposed to MC-Leucine Arginine (MC-LR) (0.1, 1, and 10 mu g L-1) for 7
   days, and the bioconcentration dynamics and responses of antioxidant
   defense system were measured during the exposure and additional
   depuration periods (7 days). MC-LR bioconcentrated in a dose dependent
   manner, from a threshold concentration of 1 mu g L-1 in both stages, and
   the levels reduced gradually during the depuration phase,
   Bioconcentration patterns of MC-LR were highly age-specific, as juvenile
   mysids showed peaks during the exposure period, whereas adults exhibited
   a peak on the first day of depuration. After exposure to 10 mu g L-1
   concentration, elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione
   (GSH) were observed during the late (days 5 and 7) exposure and early
   (days 1 and 3) depuration periods in juvenile mysids, while adult mysids
   showed a peak on day 7 of the exposure period. Age -specific responses
   were also observed in the enzymatic activities of glutathione
   S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). Juvenile
   mysids showed a significant elevation in all enzymatic activities during
   the exposure and/or depuration phase upon exposure to 10 mu g L-1 MC-LR,
   but only CAT and SOD enzymes showed significant changes during the
   exposure and/or depuration periods in adults. Overall, our results
   indicate the bioconcentration potential of MC-LR and its threshold in
   the marine mysid, in addition to age -specific MC-LR dynamics and
   subsequent biochemical responses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Trends of natural accumulation and detoxification of paralytic shellfish
   poison in two bivalves from the Northwest Patagonian inland sea},

Abstract = {The accumulation of marine toxins in aquatic filterers is a recurrent
   event that imposes serious risks to human health and important economic
   losses. While direct monitoring of seafood toxicity will remain as a
   priority for human health protection, a better understanding of toxin
   accumulation and detoxification dynamics might allow for forecasting
   tools to design better cost-effective mitigation strategies for bivalve
   farming and fisheries. In this study we explore monitoring data to
   extract temporal trends in natural accumulation and detoxification of
   paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) for two important mytilids from the
   Northwest Patagonian inland sea: Mytilus chilensis and Aulacomya atra.
   The data were collected between 1995 and 1998 in 13 stations, during two
   Alexandrium catenella blooms. The generalized linear models approach
   applied indicated A. catenella concentration, exposure time, salinity,
   temperature and zone had significant effects upon PSP concentration
   during the accumulation phase. Time, salinity, temperature and zone had
   significant effects upon PSP concentration during the detoxification
   phase. To obtain quantitative descriptors for accumulation and
   detoxification dynamics, we construct a simplified one-box model,
   defined by two parameters: 1) the proportionality constant between A.
   catenella concentration and PSP and 2) the instantaneous PSP decay rate.
   In spite of the limited nature of available data, the proposed model
   described significantly the observed variation in accumulation and
   detoxification trends of PSP. It remains. However, an evident need to
   validate the model against independent data sets from the same area and
   to identify and quantify sources of variability, uncertainty and bias
   that may affect model parameters.},

Volume = {479},

Abstract = {Accumulation of marine toxins in the organisms is one of the most
   important problems of the bivalve aquaculture. Mitigation methods are
   difficult to implement especially in species, as the mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, which have a relatively low commercial value. For
   this species, one possible way of decreasing the toxin accumulation is
   to restrict the availability of toxic cells to the mussels by means of
   the reduction of the water flow around the perimeter of the culture
   ropes. We have checked the effectivity to decrease the accumulation of
   DSP toxins (okadaic acid) in mussels of two ways of obtaining that
   reduction: surrounding the ropes with a fishing net (1 cm mesh); and
   grouping the ropes (groups of four). During a four week period - with
   relatively high concentrations of particulate matter - those two ways
   were tested and shown to effectively reduce both, toxin concentration
   and toxin burden of cultured mussels exposed to toxic populations of
   Dinophysis acuminata. The observed reductions were important, 41\% and
   37\% for grouping and surrounding with a net, respectively. Both methods
   can be used for mussel rafts and long lines and it is very likely they
   could be also effective with other kinds of toxicity and with other
   environmental conditions.
   Statement of relevance: It would allow a substantial reduction of toxin
   accumulation.},

Title = {Quantitative Determination of Gymnodimine-A by High Performance Liquid

Abstract = {Quantitative determination by high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) was performed for gymnodimine-A (GYM-A), a phycotoxin responsible
   for the contamination of Tunisian clams. This study demonstrates a rapid
   and reproducible HPLC-ultraviolet (UV) method for extraction, detection
   and quantification of GYM-A in toxic clams. The extraction of GYM-A from
   the digestive gland of clams in acetone, subsequent clean-up with
   diethyl ether and extraction with dichloromethane is the more valid
   protocol. Chromatography analyses were performed using a gradient of
   acetonitrile-water (10:90 to 90:10), containing trifluoroacetic acid
   (0.1\%) for 20 min at 1 mL/min rate with a C18 column. Recovery rates
   exceeded 96\%, and limits of detection and quantification were 5 ng/mL
   and 8 ng/g digestive gland, respectively. Repeatability and
   reproducibility were tested for various samples containing different
   levels of GYM-A. A significant correlation was observed between toxicity
   level of samples and the determined amount of GYM-A. Also, the
   persistence of GYM-A in contaminated clams from Boughrara lagoon was
   demonstrated. The kinetics discharge study of GYM-A in controlled
   medium, during 1 month, showed that the process of depuration was
   biphasic with an exponential discharge of 75\% of the total amount of
   sequestered GYM-A during the first 12 days followed by a slow discharge
   (> 10\%) for the subsequent days up to the seventeenth day. This is the
   first time that a quantitative study of GYM-A in clams from Tunisian
   coasts is performed through the development of a new method for
   detection and quantify of this phycotoxin. We found HPLC-UV a reliable
   and suitable alternative to the mouse bioassay.},

Abstract = {Azadinium spinosum (Elbrachter and Tillmann), a small marine
   dinoflagellate, has been recently described as a de novo producer of
   azaspiracid-1 and -2 (AZA1 and -2) diarrhoeic toxins. A culture of A.
   spinosum was established in our laboratory and optimised for pilot-scale
   production of this organism, to evaluate and understand AZA1 and -2
   accumulation and biotransformation in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) fed
   with A. spinosum.
   Adult mussels were continuously exposed to A. spinosum over 1 week in
   160 L cylindrical conical tanks. Three different diets were tested for
   contamination: 5000, 10 000 cells mL(-1) of A. spinosum and a mixture of
   5000 cells mL(-1) of A. spinosum with 5000 cells mL(-1) of Isochrysis
   aff. galbana (T-Iso, CCAP 927/14). During the subsequent period of
   detoxification (2 weeks), contaminated mussels were continuously fed
   with 5000 cells mL(-1) of T-Iso. Kinetics of accumulation,
   detoxification and biotransformation were evaluated, as well as the
   toxin distribution and the effect of A. spinosum on mussel digestive
   gland tubules.
   M. edulis fed on A. spinosum in the three tested conditions; this
   finding confirmed our recent experiments feeding A. spinosum to mussels.
   The original algal toxins AZA1 and -2, as well as mussel metabolites
   AZA3 to 12, -17, -19, -21 and -23 were found during these trials. After
   as little as 6 h, azaspiracid contents in mussels reached the EU
   regulatory limit, and metabolites were observed in all conditions at
   approximately 25\% of the total AZA content. This fraction exceeded 50\%
   after 24 h, and continued to increase until the end of the study. AZA17
   and -19 were found to be the main metabolites, with AZA17 concentrations
   estimated in the same order of magnitude as that of the main algal
   toxin, AZA1. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   their derivatives, several other compounds were found for the first time
   in France: (1) during the summer of 2006, AZA-1 and AZA-2 in Queen
   scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) from Northern Brittany; (2) during
   the summer of 2007, YTX and its major metabolites (45-hydroxy-YTX,
   homo-YTX, carboxy-YTX) in shellfish from the Mediterranean coast.
   Regarding YTX-group, the toxin profiles evolution in mussels during
   summer showed that: (i) the carboxy-YTX depuration rate was much slower
   than the YTX and 45-hydroxy-YTX ones; (ii) the homo-YTX concentration,
   which was initially very weak, increased significantly during the last
   deputation phase, which seems to reveal a YTX-group high metabolisation
   level in mussels. This paper reports for the first time on AZA and
   YTX-groups detection in French shellfish. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The production of toxic secondary metabolites by marine phytoplankton
   and their accumulation in molluscs and fish has ecosystem-wide and human
   health impacts. The potent neurotoxin saxitoxin and its analogs, which
   can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, are produced by species of the
   dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium. These toxins can accumulate in
   filter-feeding molluscs, including commercially grown species of
   shellfish. A feeding experiment was designed to assess the use of
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect a gene involved in
   saxitoxin biosynthesis (sxtA) in two commercial oyster stocks. Both
   diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas were fed with toxic cultures of
   Alexandrium minutum over a period of 12 days to allow toxin
   accumulation. A barcoding gene specific to Alexandrium (ITS 5.8s rRNA)
   and the sxtA gene, domain 4, which is specific to the saxitoxin
   synthesis pathway, were assayed. Both targets were detected in oysters
   collected after 6 and 12 days feeding with A. minutum, and after 24 h of
   depuration during which the oysters were fed nontoxic microalgae only.
   The target genes were not detected in control oysters. These methods can
   be used as a relatively rapid and inexpensive screen that is indicative
   of the presence of saxitoxin-producing microalgae in shellfish.},

Abstract = {The presence of Norovirus (NoV) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in
   non-depurated and depurated oysters raised in the north-west Italian
   coast was investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total and
   inorganic arsenic (As) and the presence of marine biotoxins (DSP, ASP,
   PSP) by LC-MS were also investigated. NoV was detected through all the
   sampling period in non depurated and depurated oysters with highest
   levels during wintertime (>10(4) genome copies per gram, gc/g) and
   minimum values in summer below the LOQ (<130/140 gc/g). HEV has never
   been found as well as biotoxins. Total As concentration was found in
   oysters in the range 0.45-3.0 mg/kg, while inorganic As was found in all
   samples in concentrations below the LOQ (<0.020 mg/kg). The study
   highlights how the 24 h depuration process didn't reduce significantly
   NoV levels and therefore the high concentration of NoV in oysters could
   represent a risk for consumers especially during winter and spring
   months.},

Title = {First subcellular localization of the amnesic shellfish toxin, domoic
   acid, in bivalve tissues: Deciphering the physiological mechanisms
   involved in its long-retention in the king scallop Pecten maximus},
Journal = {HARMFUL ALGAE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA), the phycotoxin responsible for amnesic shellfish
   poisoning (ASP), is an excitatory amino acid naturally produced by at
   least twenty-eight species of the bloom-forming marine diatoms
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Suspension feeders, such as bivalve mollusks, can
   accumulate and lengthy retain high amounts of DA in their tissues,
   threatening human health and leading to extensive-prolonged fishery
   closures, and severe economic losses. This is particularly problematic
   for the king scallop Pecten maximus, which retains high burdens of DA
   from months to years compared to other fast-depurator bivalves.
   Nonetheless, the physiological and cellular processes responsible for
   this retention are still unknown. In this work, for the first time, a
   novel immunohistochemical techniques based on the use of an anti-DA
   antibody was successfully developed and applied for DAdetection in
   bivalve tissues at a subcellular level. Our results show that in
   naturally contaminated P. maximus following a Pseudo-nitzschia australis
   outbreak, DA is visualized mainly within small membrane-bounded vesicles
   (1 - 2.5 mu m) within the digestive gland cells, identified as
   autophagosomic structures by means of immuneelectron microscopy, as well
   as in the mucus-producing cells, particularly those from gonad ducts and
   digestive tract. Trapping of DA in autophagososomes may be a key
   mechanism in the long retention of DA in scallops. These results and the
   development of DA-immunodetection are essential to provide a better
   understanding of the fate of DA, and further characterize DA
   contamination-decontamination kinetics in marine bivalves, as well as
   the main mechanisms involved in the long retention of this toxin in P.

Abstract = {The diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia (Peragallo) associated with the
   production of domoic acid (DA), the toxin reposnsible for amnesic
   shellfish poisoning, is abundant in Scottish waters. A two year study
   examined the relationship between Pseudo-nitzschia cells in the water
   column and DA concentration in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at two
   sites, and king scallops (Pecten maximus) at one site. The rate of DA
   uptake and depuration differed greatly between the two species with M.
   edulis whole tissue accumulating and depurating 7 mu g g(-1) (now
   expressed as mg kg(-1)) per week. In contrast, it took 12 weeks for DA
   to depurate from P. maximus gonad tissue from a concentration of 68 mu g
   g(-1) (now mg kg(-1)) to <20 mu g g(-1) (now mg kg(-1)). The DA
   depuration rate from P. maximus whole tissue was <5\% per week during
   both years of the study. Correlations between the Pseudo-nitzschia cell
   densities and toxin concentrations were weak to moderate for M. edulis
   and weak for P. maximus. Seasonal diversity on a species level was
   observed within the Pseudo-nitzschia genus at both sites with more DA
   toxicity associated with summer/autumn Pseudo-nitzschia blooms when P.
   australis was observed in phytoplankton samples. This study reveals the
   marked difference in DA uptake and depuration in two shellfish species
   of commercial importance in Scotland. The use of these shellfish species
   to act as a proxy for DA in the environment still requires
   investigation. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Photosynthetic microorganisms play an important role in aquatic
   ecosystems. Among them about 300 are involved in harmful events by
   producing potent and persistent natural toxins (phycotoxins) that can be
   harmful or even lethal to humans and animals. These chemically diverse
   compounds synthesized by toxic phytoplankton species have been
   associated with different syndromes in humans put together in diagnosis
   shellfish poisoning. As shellfish are filter feeding they can be a
   possible vector of phycotoxins. Therefore, in EU there are legislative
   levels of phycotoxins in shellfish above that seafood is not safe for
   consumption. The dynamics and toxicity of harmful phytoplankton species
   is unpredictable and variable, influenced by complex of factors. For
   this reason, an instantaneous phycotoxins determination can be
   representative when monitoring in not possible. The aim of this research
   was to study the case of occurrence and concentration of phycotoxins in
   plankton and mussel samples in a relatively short area on the Bulgarian
   Black Sea South coast. Sampling was performed during a two-day field
   trip in June 2017. Phycotoxins determination was performed with liquid
   chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In total plankton,
   wild and farmed mussel samples were analyzed. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) was
   detected in only plankton samples and yessotoxin (YTX) only in mussel
   samples. As plankton and mussel sampling was performed in same
   locations, results indicate that PTX-2 accumulation can be expected in
   mussel samples in perspective. Detection of YTX in only mussel samples
   demonstrates mussels are in depuration phase. The research provides an
   evidence for presence YTX and PTX-2 producing phytoplankton species in
   the investigated area. Determination and isolation of these species
   would be valuable to better understand and manage the impact of
   potential harmful algal blooms and in order to prevent human
   intoxication and losses to aquaculture.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of oyster beds in the northern Arabian Gulf
   Coast of the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The United Arab of Emirates (UAE) hosts valuable coastal and marine
   biodiversity, and oysters are one of the habitants of its marine
   ecosystem. Oysters play an essential role in the nearshore coasts where
   they work as an active filter. They filter nutrients, phytoplankton,
   sediments, heavy metals, and toxins out of the water, which improves the
   water quality. This is the first study that characterizes oyster bed
   habitats in the UAE by analyzing water quality parameters, polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)and heavy
   metals in water, sediments and oyster samples collected from five
   locations along the coasts of Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm al Quwain. Oyster
   bed areas supported a diverse assemblage of benthic life including
   oysters, scallops, pen shells, hard corals, and macroalgae. Mobile
   species in these habitats included groupers, emperors, snappers, sea
   snakes, among others. The phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by
   diatoms, dinoflagellates, and small cryptophytes. Harmful diatom
   Pseudonitzschia was found in all locations. No detectable concentrations
   of PAHs and OCPs were reported in this study, and water quality
   parameters were within the acceptable levels for the region. On the
   other hand, water quality index was reported marginal, mostly due to the
   presence of higher than acceptable concentrations of chromium and
   mercury in all sites studied. Bioconcentration factors concluded that
   oysters were able to bioconcentrate metals such as arsenic, cadmium,
   chromium, and zinc, when compared to water. No detectable concentrations
   of lead and mercury were reported in oysters, suggesting higher
   depuration rates for those metals.},

Abstract = {In 1994 a major biotoxin event occurred along the east coast of the
   South Island, New Zealand. Gymnodimine, a unique bioactive spiroimine,
   was isolated and characterised from Foveaux Strait dredge oysters
   (Tiostrea chilensis = Ostrea chilensis) collected during this outbreak.
   This study reports the results of liquid chromatographic-mass,
   spectrometric analysis for gymnodimine in 217 samples from eight species
   of shellfish over the years 1993-99. Of these samples 155, covering six
   species of shellfish, contained detectable gymnodimine with a range in
   concentration from 14.8 to 23 400 mug/kg. Gymnodimine-containing
   shellfish occurred at 37 of the 63 sites sampled from around New
   Zealand. This study demonstrates that accumulation of gymnodimine is not
   limited to T. chilensis and can occur in other shellfish species over
   much of New Zealand. Gymnodimine is a possible cause of the numerous
   historical biotoxin screen-positive results.},

Title = {Brevetoxin in two planktivorous fishes after exposure to Karenia
   brevis:: implications for food-web transfer to bottlenose dolphins},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {356},
Pages = {251-258},
Abstract = {Brevetoxin uptake was analyzed in 2 common planktivorous fish that are
   likely food-web vectors for dolphin mortality events associated with
   brevetoxin-producing red tides. Fish were exposed to
   brevetoxin-producing Karenia brevis for 10 h under conditions previously
   reported to produce optimal uptake of toxin in blood after oral
   exposure. Striped mullet Mugil cephalus were exposed to a low dose of
   brevetoxin, and uptake and depuration by specific organs were evaluated
   over a 2 mo period. Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus specimens were
   used to characterize a higher brevetoxin dose uptake into whole body
   components and evaluate depuration over I mo. We found a high uptake of
   toxin by menhaden, with a body to water ratio of 57 after a 10 h
   exposure and a slow elimination with a half life (t(1/2)) of 24 d.
   Elimination occurred rapidly from the intestine (t(1/2) < 1 wk) and
   muscle (t(1/2) = 1 wk) compartments and redistributed to liver which
   continued to accumulate body stores of toxin for 4 wk. The accumulation
   and elimination characteristics of the vectoring capacity of these 2
   fish species are interpreted in relation to data from the Florida
   Panhandle dolphin mortality event of 2004. We show that due to slow
   elimination rate of brevetoxin in planktivorous fish, brevetoxin-related
   dolphin mortality events may occur without evidence of a concurrent
   harmful algal bloom event.},

Abstract = {The transfer and transformation of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   from scallop Chlamys nobilis to spiny lobster Panulirus stimpsoni were
   investigated in the present study. The results demonstrate that transfer
   and transformation of PSP toxins occurred when Panulirus stimpsoni were
   fed with toxic viscera of Chlamys nobilis, but depurated with non-toxic
   squids. Additionally, only the lobster hepatopancreas were found to
   contain PSP, and the toxin profiles were the same with those in the
   viscera of the scallop, including carbamate toxins (GTX(1-3)),
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C1+2 and B-1) and decarbamoyl toxins (dcGTX(2 +
   3)). Unlike the lobster, the scallop contained more alpha than beta
   toxins. After being fed with toxic Chlamys nobili for 6 d, Panulirus
   stimpsoni selectively accumulated N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins with low
   toxicity. However, when they were depurated with non-toxic squid,
   N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins tended to transform into carbamate toxins with
   higher toxicity. The concentration of dcGTX(2 + 3) in Panulirus
   stimpsoni decreased significantly and wasn't detectable after depuration
   for 6 d, which was likely due to their initial low accumulation of
   toxins. These results reveal that PSP could be transferred and
   transformed in Crustaceans along the given food chain under the
   conditions of laboratory, but there are many questions remained to be
   solved, and the further studies should be carried out. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {N-Acetylcysteine boosts xenobiotic detoxification in shellfish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {131-140},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Water pollution represents a threat of increasing importance to human
   health. Bivalve mollusks are filter-feeding organisms that can
   accumulate chemical and microbiological contaminants in their tissues
   from very low concentrations in the water or sediments. Consumption of
   contaminated shellfish is one of the main causes of seafood poisoning.
   Thus, marine bivalves are normally depurated in sterilized seawater for
   48 h to allow the removal of bacteria. However, this depuration time
   might be insufficient to eliminate chemical contaminants from their
   tissues. We have developed a novel technology that accelerates up to
   fourfold the excretion rate of xenobiotics in bivalves by treatment with
   the antioxidant and glutathione (GSH) pro-drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
   during the depuration period. NAC improved dose-dependently the
   detoxification of the organophosphate (OP) pesticide fenitrothion in the
   mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, diminishing its levels up to nearly a
   hundred fold compared to conventional depuration, by enhancing the
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and inducing the GSH anabolism
   (GSH synthesis and reduction by glutathione reductase). Notably, this
   induction in GSH anabolism and GST activity was also observed in
   uncontaminated bivalves treated with NAC. As the GSH pathway is involved
   in the detoxification of many pollutants and biotoxins from harmful
   algal blooms, we validated this proof of principle in king scallops
   (Pecten maximus) that naturally accumulated the amnesic shellfish
   poisoning (ASP) toxin domoic acid. We illustrate here a method that
   enhances the elimination of organic contaminants in shellfish, opening
   new avenues of depuration of marine organisms. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Batch cultures of the toxigenic diatom Nitzschia pungens Grunow f.
   multiseries Hasle were fed to blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and deep sea
   Atlantic scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to elucidate conditions
   under which domoic acid (DA) was accumulated and excreted (depurated).
   Mussels accumulated the toxin to a maximum level of 13 mug g-1, at rates
   of 0.21 to 3.7 mug h-1 g-1 dry weight. Accumulation efficiency (the
   proportion of accumulated DA to estimated net uptake) ranged from 1-5\%.
   The highest filtration rate of 1.7 l h-1 occurred at concentrations of
   4-8 x 10(6) Nitzschia cells l-1 with no formation of pseudofeces.
   Depuration rates between fed and starved mussels over a 2 h test period
   were the same. The depuration rate of domoic acid was about 17\% d-1 and
   did not account for the low uptake efficiencies, so it is suggested that
   most of the DA is lost from mussels in the solution during the feeding
   process. Domoic acid accumulation in mussels was dependent on the amount
   of toxin available, which in tum was a function of the density and
   growth phase of the Nitzschia population. Changes in filtration rate
   with Nitzschia concentration and depuration rate with time can account
   for the DA levels of mussels collected during toxic episodes in Cardigan
   Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada in 1988 and 1989.
   Scallops accumulated DA (0.39-1.3 mug h-1 g-1 more slowly than mussels,
   however, accumulation efficiencies ranged from 5-100\%. Filtration rates
   remained relatively low and constant at 0.08 l h-1. Scallops retained
   domoic acid longer than mussels, a fact which must be considered in the
   marketing of whole scallops for human consumption.},

Abstract = {Historically, public confidence in shellfish became damaged by health
   scares of bacterial, algal toxin and viral origin. Depuration has
   largely eliminated bacterial outbreaks, other than marine vibrios, but
   viral risks are only partially reduced during normal depuration
   timescales. Water quality legislation and shellfish hygiene legislation
   have together reduced risks from shellfish consumption. Even with good
   controls, a small element of risk remains. Self-regulation by the
   industry and good management practice can achieve much. Confidence has
   also been damaged by unfounded dietary cholesterol scares. Most people
   do not significantly concentrate cholesterol from food. Only people with
   familial hypercholesterolaemia need caution. Filter feeders are low in
   cholesterol and high in plant sterols. Risks need to be balanced against
   the health benefits of shellfish in the diet, which are summarised.},

Title = {Sea temperature influences accumulation of tetrodotoxin in British
   bivalve shellfish},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {885},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent neurotoxin mostly associated with
   pufferfish poisoning, is also found in bivalve shellfish. Recent studies
   into this emerging food safety threat reported TTX in a few, mainly
   estuarine, shellfish production areas in some European countries,
   including the United Kingdom. A pattern in occurrences has started to
   emerge, however the role of temperature on TTX has not been investigated
   in detail. Therefore, we conducted a large systematic TTX screening
   study, encompassing over 3500 bivalve samples collected throughout 2016
   from 155 shellfish monitoring sites along the coast of Great Britain.
   Overall, we found that only 1.1 \% of tested samples contained TTX above
   the reporting limit of 2 mu g/kg whole shellfish flesh and these samples
   all originated from ten shellfish production sites in southern England.
   Subsequent continuous monitoring of selected areas over a five-year
   period showed a potential seasonal TTX accumulation in bivalves,
   starting in June when water temperatures reached around 15 degrees C.
   For the first time, satellite-derived data were also applied to
   investigate temperature differences between sites with and with-out
   confirmed presence of TTX in 2016. Although average annual temperatures
   were similar in both groups, daily mean values were higher in summer and
   lower in winter at sites where TTX was found. Here, temperature also
   in-creased significantly faster during late spring and early summer, the
   critical period for TTX. Our study supports the hy-pothesis that
   temperature is one of the key triggers of events leading to TTX
   accumulation in European bivalves.},

Abstract = {In costal ecosystems, copepods coexist with toxin-producing
   phytoplankton. The presence of copepods can amplify the phytoplankton
   toxin production and thereby increase the overall toxicity of a bloom.
   Copepods are not always affected by the toxins and can vector the toxins
   to higher trophic levels. To investigate the interactions between toxin
   producers and their grazers, we determined the kinetics of
   grazer-induced increases in toxin production and the subsequent toxin
   reduction in a domoic acid (DA)-producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia
   seriata. The cellular DA level of the diatom was within the range of in
   situ measurements. Ten days after removal of the copepods, 28\% +/- 8\%
   of the cellular DA still remained in the cells. Simultaneously, we
   monitored the toxicokinetics of DA in two grazers; Calanus finmarchicus
   and Calanus glacialis. After 144 h of grazing on the toxic diet, the
   copepods accumulated and retained high concentrations of DA. Nine hours
   after exposure to the toxic diet was terminated, the copepods had
   depurated 70\% +/- 10\% of the DA. The depuration lasted 4 +/- 2 d and
   was independent of Calanus species and treatment. We explored the
   possible physiological responses in copepods after feeding on a purely
   toxic diet from gene expression profiles of C. finmarchicus. Expression
   of genes regulating several major metabolic and cellular processes was
   reduced in copepods feeding on DA-containing diatoms, and we hypothesize
   that this is because of exposure to DA.},

   Dynamics in Mussels Mytilus coruscus},
Journal = {TOXINS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This study assessed the impact of increasing seawater surface
   temperature (SST) and toxic algal abundance (TAA) on the accumulation,
   tissue distribution and elimination dynamics of paralytic shellfish
   toxins (PSTs) in mussels. Mytilus coruscus were fed with the
   PSTs-producing dinoflagellate A. catenella under four simulated
   environment conditions. The maximum PSTs concentration was determined to
   be 3548 mu g STX eq.kg(-1), which was four times higher than the EU
   regulatory limit. The increasing SST caused a significant decline in
   PSTs levels in mussels with rapid elimination rates, whereas high TAA
   increased the PSTs concentration. As a result, the PSTs toxicity levels
   decreased under the combined condition. Additionally, toxin burdens were
   assessed within shellfish tissues, with the highest levels quantified in
   the hepatopancreas. It is noteworthy that the toxin burden shifted
   towards the mantle from gill, muscle and gonad at the 17th day.
   Moreover, variability of PSTs was measured, and was associated with
   changes in each environmental factor. Hence, this study primarily
   illustrates the combined effects of SST and TAA on PSTs toxicity,
   showing that increasing environmental temperature is of benefit to lower
   PSTs toxicity with rapid elimination rates.},

Abstract = {Domoic acid (DA) the toxin responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning
   (ASP) has proven problematic for king scallop Pecten maximus fisheries
   and aquaculture in Ireland. Toxin concentration in hepatopancreas of
   individual scallops and composite samples of gonad and adductor muscle
   of scallops suspended from a submerged longline, 2 in beneath the water
   surface and on a seabed site, 12-15 in beneath the Suspended scallops
   were monitored from February 2003 to February 2004 at an aquaculture
   site in Clew Bay, Ireland. DA concentration in hepatopancreas of
   scallops from the seabed and longline peaked in April 2003. individual
   concentrations reaching 1037.1 mu g.g(-1) and 1212.6 mu g.g(-1)
   respectively. No statistically significant differences were exhibited
   between DA concentration in hepatopancreas of seabed and long-line
   scallops except on 1 of the 10 sampling occasions. Slow depuration of DA
   toxin from hepatopancreas Occurred front April 2003 to June 2003 and the
   concentration remained relatively stable from June 2003 to Feb 2004.
   Interpretation of DA concentrations in gonad were complicated by the
   lower concentrations recorded and the variable size of the gonad caused
   by the reproductive cycle over the 12-month study duration. DA
   concentrations in adductor muscle were below the limit of detection
   throughout the investigation. In summary DA concentration between
   scallops held in suspension or maintained on the seabed exhibited minor
   difference, and routine monitoring samples could be collected annually
   and held in suspended culture systems rather than using more expensive
   diver collection for sample procurement.},

Abstract = {The physiological effects of domoic acid on marine invertebrates which
   are known to accumulate this neurotoxin have not been investigated
   previously. Changes in haemolymph pH, PCO2, and PO2 were measured in
   Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus californianus when exposed continuously to
   the domoic acid producing diatom, Pseudonitzschia pungens f.
   multiseries, for 48 h followed by a 120 h clearance period. A general
   stress response by C. gigas was characterized by a respiratory acidosis
   from shell closure bs h after introduction of the algae. Haemolymph pH
   in the oyster returned to control levels after 36 h exposure and
   although hypoxic conditions persisted during 48 h exposure PO2 levels
   returned to normal only after 24 h of clearance, Substantial hypercapnia
   and elevated haemolymph bicarbonate occurred after 8 h exposure which
   was rectified during the remaining period of exposure. Body burden of
   domoic acid was greatest in the oyster after 4 h of exposure. At 120 h
   of continuous clearance the gill, muscle, and soft tissue still revealed
   detectable levels of domoic acid. M. californianus exhibited no
   significant change in haemolymph pH on exposure to the alga although a
   slight alkalosis occurred, which is associated normally with increased
   filtration (feeding) and gas exchange. Haemolymph PCO2 and PO2 were
   within the range of established control values throughout the
   experiment, Domoic acid was assimilated to the highest level in gill
   tissue and no detectable concentration of toxin was observed in any
   tissue after 120 h of clearance.},

Journal = {OCEANOLOGIA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {57},

Pages = {93-101},
Abstract = {In the current study we present the first report on the bioaccumulation
   of microcystins (MC) in zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha from the
   eutrophic brackish water Curonian Lagoon. The bioaccumulation capacity
   was related to age structure of mussels and ambient environmental
   conditions. We also discuss the relevant implications of these findings
   for biomonitoring of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Curonian Lagoon
   and potential consequences for D. polymorpha cultivation activities
   considered for the futures as remediation measure. Samples for the
   analysis were collected twice per year, in June and September, in 2006,
   2007 and 2008, from two sites within the littoral zone of the lagoon.
   The highest microcystin concentrations were measured in mussels larger
   than 30 mm length and sampled in 2006 (when a severe toxic cyanobacteria
   bloom occurred). In the following years, a consistent reduction in
   bioaccumutated MC concentration was noticed. However, certain amount of
   microcystin was recorded in mussel tissues in 2007 and 2008, when no
   cyanotoxins were reported in the phytoplankton. Considering high
   depuration rates and presence of cyanotoxins in the bottom sediments
   well after the recorded toxic blooms, we assume mechanism of secondary
   contamination when microcystin residuals could be uptaken by mussels
   with resuspended sediment particles. (C) 2014 Institute of Oceanology of

Title = {An investigation into ciguatoxin bioaccumulation in sharks},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {234-243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Ciguatoxins (CTXs) produced by benthic Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates,
   readily biotransform and bioaccumulate in food chains ultimately
   bioconcentrating in high-order, carnivorous marine species. Certain
   shark species, often feeding at, or near the top of the food-chain have
   the ability to bioaccumulate a suite of toxins, from both anthropogenic
   and algal sources. As such, these apex predators are likely sinks for
   CTXs. This assumption, in conjunction with anecdotal knowledge of
   poisoning incidents, several nonspecific feeding trials whereby various
   terrestrial animals were fed suspect fish flesh, and a single incident
   in Madagascar in 1994, have resulted in the widespread acceptance that
   sharks may accumulate CTXs. This prompted a study to investigate
   original claims within the literature, as well as investigate CTX
   bioaccumulation in the muscle and liver of 22 individual sharks from
   nine species, across four locations along the east coast of Australia.
   Utilizing an updated ciguatoxin extraction method with HPLC-MS/MS, we
   were unable to detect P-CTX-1, P-CTX-2 or P-CTX-3, the three primary CTX
   congeners, in muscle or liver samples. We propose four theories to
   address this finding: (1) to date, methods have been optimized for
   teleost species and may not be appropriate for elasmobranchs, or the
   CI-Xs may be below the limit of detection; (2) CTX may be biotransformed
   into elasmobranch-specific congeners as a result of unique metabolic
   properties; (3) 22 individuals may be an inadequate sample size given
   the rare occurrence of high-order ciguatoxic organisms and potential for
   CTX depuration; and (4) the ephemeral nature and inconsistent toxin
   profiles of Gambierdiscus blooms may have undermined our classifications
   of certain areas as CTX hotspots. These results, in combination with the
   lack of clarity within the literature, suggest that ciguatoxin
   bioaccumulation in sharks remains elusive, and warrants further
   investigation to determine the dynamics of toxin production,
   accumulation and transformation throughout the entire food-web. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The metabolism and elimination of brevetoxins were examined in the
   Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) following controlled exposures to
   Karenia brevis cultures in the laboratory. After a 2-day exposure period
   (similar to62 million cells/oyster), elimination of brevetoxins and
   their metabolites was monitored by using liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS). Composite toxin in oyster extracts was measured by
   in vitro assay (i.e. cytotoxicity, receptor binding, and ELISA). Of the
   parent algal toxins, PbTx-1 and PbTx-2 were not detectable by LC/MS in
   K. brevis-exposed oysters. PbTx-3 and PbTx-9, which are accumulated
   directly from K. brevis and through metabolic reduction of PbTx-2 in the
   oyster, were at levels initially (after exposure) of 0.74 and 0.49 mug
   equiv./g, respectively, and were eliminated largely within 2 weeks after
   dosing. PbTx-7 and PbTx-10, the reduced forms of PbTx-1, were
   non-detectable. Conjugative brevetoxin metabolites identified previously
   in field-exposed oysters were confirmed in the laboratory-exposed
   oysters. Cysteine conjugates of PbTx-1 and PbTx-2, and their sulfoxides,
   were in the highest abundance, as apparent in LC/MS ion traces, and were
   detectable for up to 6 months after dosing. Composite toxin measurements
   by in vitro assay also reflected persistence (up to 6 months) of
   brevetoxin residues in the oyster. Levels of cysteine conjugates, as
   determined by LC/MS, were well correlated with those of composite toxin,
   as measured by ELISA, throughout depuration. Composite toxin levels by
   cytotoxicity assay were well correlated with those by receptor binding
   assay. Cysteine-PbTx conjugates are useful LC/MS determinants of
   brevetoxin exposure and potential markers for composite toxin in the
   Eastern oyster. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Monitoring of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) toxins in shellfish from
   the Catalan coast started in 2001. No ASP toxins were detected in any of
   the analyses performed before 2008. On 22 January 2008, domoic acid (DA)
   was detected in Donax trunculus (0.5 mg kg(-1)) and confirmed by rapid
   resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (0.6 mg
   kg(-1)). A total of 974 shellfish samples were analyzed from January
   2008 to December 2011, covering all the Catalan production areas and the
   most important marketed species. DA was detected in 23.8 \% of the
   samples and was recorded every month in all areas and all species,
   except Ostrea edulis, although the percentage of samples with DA and DA
   content varied widely among samples. DA exceeded the regulatory level of
   20 mg kg(-1) twice: in Callista chione sampled on February 2008 and in
   D. trunculus sampled on April 2010. DA content in Bolinus brandaris
   appeared constant and close to 4.5 mg kg(-1) for months in 2009. Mytilus
   galloprovincialis, Crassostrea gigas, and Ruditapes sp. presented very
   low concentrations of DA in the Ebro Delta bays, despite 113 alert
   situations according to Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundances and the high
   number of shellfish samples analyzed. The origin of DA in Catalan
   shellfish remains unknown.},

Abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of flame retardants, are
   bioaccumulative toxins that can biomagnify in food webs. However, little
   is known about the toxicokinetics of total and congener-specific BDEs in
   lower vertebrates. The authors exposed northern leopard frog (Lithobates
   (Rana) pipiens) tadpoles to diets containing DE-71 (a pentabromodiphenyl
   ether mixture (0ng/g as control, 71.4ng/g, and 634 DE-71ng/g wet mass))
   for 50 d, followed by a period of depuration during which they were fed
   only undosed (control) food. After 28 d, tadpoles eliminated over 94\%
   of the sigma PBDEs from their tissues (t1/2=5.9 +/- 1.9 d) with no
   significant differences in elimination rates for the predominant
   congeners. Elimination of BDE-99 was independent of dose, indicating
   first-order kinetics. It did not fit a biexponential model significantly
   better than a monoexponential model, indicating single-compartment
   elimination. To compare developmental life-stage kinetics following
   larval exposure, the authors collected individuals at the beginning and
   end of metamorphosis and at 70 d postmetamorphosis. During
   metamorphosis, total-body residues per individual did not significantly
   change, implying little to no elimination. After 70 d, juvenile frogs
   eliminated 89.7\% of the sigma PBDEs from their tissues, and BDE-47 was
   eliminated at a faster rate (t1/2= 17.3 d) than BDE-99 and BDE-100
   (t1/2=63.0 d and 69.3 d, respectively). Because the kinetics of PBDEs in
   L. pipiens differed among life stages, developmental life
   stageespecially for species that undergo metamorphosisshould be
   considered when determining the toxicity of persistent organic
   pollutants. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:1631-1640. (c) 2013 SETAC},

Abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are the most studied toxins of cyanobacteria in
   freshwater bodies worldwide. However, they are poorly documented in
   coastal waters in several parts of the world. In this study, we
   investigated the composition of cyanobacteria and the presence of
   microcystins (MCs) in several coastal aquatic ecosystems of Nigeria.
   Direct morphological analysis revealed that members of the
   genusOscillatoriawere dominant with five species, followed
   byTrichodesmiumwith two species in Nigerian coastal waters. Oso Ibanilo
   had the highest cyanobacterial biomass (998 x 10(3)cells/L), followed by
   Rivers Ocean (156 x 10(3)cells/L). Except for the Cross River Ocean,
   cyanobacteria were present in all the investigated aquatic ecosystems.
   Ten (10) out of twenty water bodies examined had detectable levels of
   MCs. Furthermore, genomic DNA analysis for themcyE gene of microcystin
   synthetase (mcy) cluster showed identities higher than 86\% (query
   coverage > 96\%) with toxic strains of cyanobacteria in all the samples
   analyzed. Also, the sequences of samples matched those of uncultured
   cyanobacteria from recreational lakes in Southern Germany. Our findings
   indicate that the presence of toxic cyanobacteria in coastal waters of
   Nigeria is of public and environmental health concern.},

Abstract = {juvenile king scallops Pecten maximus of 1.23 cm shell height were
   exposed to domoic acid (DA) and the toxin accumulation and effects of
   bearing this toxin were investigated. After feeding on a formulated feed
   containing about 0.19 pg DA per particle for 7 days, the juvenile
   scallops incorporated a relatively low DA burden of 15.9 ng g(-1), which
   was similar to those exposed to 10 and 50 ng ml(-1) dissolved DA. The
   maximum DA accumulation, 302.5 ng g(-1) whole tissue, was achieved by
   scallops maintained in 100 ng ml(-1) dissolved DA for 18 days. No
   significant effect of exposure to DA was observed on feeding rate (on
   microalgae), shell valve activity (shell clatter), righting response, or
   the secretion of byssus threads. However, negative impacts on growth
   rate and survival were found for scallops exposed to DA-spiked feed.
   This is the first study on DA accumulation in juvenile P. maximus and on
   the negative effect of DA on this life history stage. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Interannual variability in the timing of New England shellfish toxicity
   and relationships to environmental forcing},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {447},
Pages = {255-266},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Routine monitoring along the coast of the Gulf of Maine (GoM) reveals
   shellfish toxicity nearly every summer, but at varying times, locations,
   and magnitudes. The responsible toxin is known to be produced by the
   dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense, yet there is little apparent
   association between Alexandrium abundance and shellfish toxicity. One
   possibility is that toxic cells are persistent in offshore areas and
   variability in shellfish toxicity is caused not by changes in overall
   abundance, but rather by variability in transport processes.
   Measurements of offshore Alexandrium biomass are scarce, so we bypass
   cell abundance as an explanatory variable and focus instead on the
   relations between shellfish toxicity and concurrent metrics of GoM
   meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography. While this yields over two
   decades (1985-2005) of data representing a variety of interannual
   conditions, the toxicity data are gappy in spatial and temporal
   coverage. We address this through a combination of parametric curve
   fitting and hierarchical cluster analysis to reveal eight archetypical
   modes of seasonal toxicity timing. Groups of locations are then formed
   that have similar interannual patterns in these archetypes. Finally, the
   interannual patterns within each group are related to available
   environmental metrics using classification trees. Results indicate that
   a weak cross-shore sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the summer
   is the strongest correlate of shellfish toxicity, likely by signifying a
   hydrological connection between offshore Alexandrium populations and
   near-shore shellfish beds. High cumulative downwelling wind strength
   early in the season is revealed as a precursor consistent with this
   mechanism. Although previous studies suggest that alongshore transport
   is important in moving Alexandrium from the eastern to western GoM,
   alongshore SST gradient is not an important correlate of toxicity in our
   study. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for
   designing efficient and effective shellfish monitoring programs along
   the GoM coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {MARINE DRUGS},

Abstract = {A potent and heat-stable tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found to accumulate
   in various marine bivalve species, including Pacific oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas), raising a food safety concern. While several
   studies on geographical occurrence of TTX have been conducted, there is
   a lack of knowledge about the distribution of the toxin within and
   between bivalves. We, therefore, measured TTX in the whole flesh,
   mantle, gills, labial palps, digestive gland, adductor muscle and
   intravalvular fluid of C. gigas using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. Weekly monitoring during summer months revealed the
   highest TTX concentrations in the digestive gland (up to 242 mu g/kg),
   significantly higher than in other oyster tissues. Intra-population
   variability of TTX, measured in the whole flesh of each of twenty
   animals, reached 46\% and 32\% in the two separate batches,
   respectively. In addition, an inter-population study was conducted to
   compare TTX levels at four locations within the oyster production area.
   TTX concentrations in the whole flesh varied significantly between some
   of these locations, which was unexplained by the differences in weight
   of flesh. This is the first study examining TTX distribution in C. gigas
   and the first confirmation of the preferential accumulation of TTX in
   oyster digestive gland.},

Abstract = {Azaspiracid (AZA) producing microalgae have been reported
   internationally and could potentially impact a variety of seafood.
   Scallops (Chlamys farreri) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from
   China were fed with the AZA2 producer, Azadinium poporum, to study
   uptake, metabolism and oxidative stress in the shellfish. LC-MS/MS
   showed significant accumulation and differential metabolism of AZA2 in
   the scallops and mussels. In mussels AZA2 was metabolized to AZA19, with
   subsequent decarboxylation to AZA6. In scallops no AZA19 or AZA6 was
   observed, however, a novel AZA metabolite was formed that is isobaric
   with AZA19 ({[}M+H](1), m/z 886), but elutes at a different retention
   time. In addition it was noted that the scallop metabolite was stable
   during heating, while AZA19 has been shown to decarboxylate.
   Concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activities of
   antioxidant enzymes were monitored. ROS levels increased slightly in the
   meat of scallops and mussels due to starvation in the acclimation and
   depuration periods, but reduced in the feeding periods with non-toxic
   Isocluysis galbana or toxic A. poporum. No obvious variations were found
   in activities for a range of antioxidant enzymes. These results provide
   new insights on the potential for accumulation and metabolism of AZAs in
   bivalve species relevant to this area of China, which is of importance
   considering the recent finding of AZA producing microalgae in the
   region. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In the fall of 1991 domoic acid was discovered in coastal Pacific razor
   clams Siliqua patula (Dixon, 1789) in Washington and Oregon states at
   levels higher than acceptable for safe human consumption, thereby
   forcing a closure of the recreational harvest. Tissue distribution data
   indicated the clams maintained these elevated levels from fall through
   early summer of 1992 in the edible muscular tissues (mantle, siphon,
   adductor muscles, and muscular foot) with concentrations of toxin
   averaging from 23.3-50.7 mug/g. The concentration in the non-edible
   tissues (gill, digestive gland, gonad, and siphon tip) ranged from trace
   amounts to 8.4 mug/g. Clams that were dissected into edible and non
   edible pooled portions contained 36.4 +/- 22.6 and 13.7 +/- 7.6 mug/g,
   respectively. On an additional sampling date, clams were sampled fresh
   or were frozen whole before sampling. The concentration in the edible
   portion of the fresh clams averaged 16.8 +/- 11.6 mug/g, while the blood
   and dissection fluids contained only trace amounts of toxin. The domoic
   acid concentration of the frozen edible portion averaged 12.6 +/- 6.9
   mug/g with meltwater levels reaching 4.2 mug/g and the dissection fluid
   containing up to 10.0 mug/g. Clams collected in December 1991 with
   elevated levels of toxin (47.9 +/- 12.7 mug/g) that were held on Strait
   of Juan de Fuca seawater for three months maintained this level of
   contamination (44.3 +/- 19.8 mug/g). Razor clams from Alaska held under
   identical conditions during this time period did not contain detectable
   levels of toxin. Razor clam tissues collected in 1985, 1990, and the
   summer of 1991 revealed only trace levels of toxin.},

Abstract = {Bacteria that are members of the Vibrio genus are ubiquitous in the
   marine environment and are part of the natural estuarine microflora.
   Several Vibrio species can accumulate in shellfish through filter
   feeding, and pose a significant threat to human health from important
   fishery resources. Little is known about the interactions of these
   microorganisms with shellfish that result in significant accumulation of
   the bacteria. Vibrio vulnificus can cause fatal septicemic infections in
   individuals who are immunocompromised or suffer from liver disease
   through consumption of raw shellfish harvested from warm water regions.
   In addition, the bacterium can cause severe necrotizing wound infections
   in otherwise healthy people who handle shellfish. Such infections impact
   the entire U.S. shellfish industry causing significant economic losses.
   Another vibrio, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, has a wider geographic
   distribution and is a significant source of shellfish-transmitted
   gastrointestinal illness in humans, with increased incidence during
   summer months. Our research is aimed at the characterization of surface
   structures called pili or fimbriae to ascertain their function in
   persistence of vibrios in oysters, as well as in human pathogenesis.
   Pili are thin (ca. 10 nm diameter) fiber-like structures that extend
   from bacterial cells and are often involved in cell to cell binding or
   attachment of a bacterium to a variety of biotic and abiotic surfaces.
   In initial studies on the role of a specific class of pili in V.
   vulnificus, designated type IV, we have demonstrated their role in
   adherence to human epithelial cells, biofilm formation, virulence in a
   mouse model, and persistence in oysters. We are currently examining the
   function of homologous pili in K parahaemolyticus. If these factors
   prove to be responsible for the bacterium's ability to colonize oyster
   tissue, they may present a unique and specific target(s) for compounds
   designed to interfere with this attachment, leading to depuration
   methods that could potentially reduce or eliminate the organisms from
   oysters.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As filter-feeders, bivalves naturally come into direct contact with
   microcystins ( MCs) in eutrophic water bodies suffering from
   cyanobacteria blooms. To date, however, no studies have quantified the
   dynamics of microcystin accumulation and depuration in the edible
   freshwater bivalve Corbicula fluminea when exposed to dense bloom
   concentrations of Microcystis aeruginosa, while considering dynamic
   changes of biochemical indexes and feeding structure. In the present
   study, the bioaccumulation and detoxification of microcystin-LR (MC-LR)
   in C. fluminea were investigated. Our results showed that C. fluminea
   would graze equally efficiently on green algae and M. aeruginosa,
   irrespective of whether the M. aeruginosa strains were toxic or
   non-toxic. MCs could be accumulated and depurated by C. fluminea
   efficiently. In addition, linear and exposure time-dependent MC-LR
   accumulation patterns were observed in C. fluminea. Activities of
   biotransformation (glutathione S- transferase, GST) and antioxidant
   enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD, and catalase, CAT) and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in various tissues of treated clams were
   stimulated by MCs in a tissue-specific manner. Our findings indicated
   that C. fluminea hepatopancreas was the primary target organ for MC-LR
   detoxification processes, as evidenced by a significant increase in GST
   activity. Besides, gills and mantle were more sensitive than the other
   tissues to oxidative stress in the initial microcystin exposure period
   with a significant increase in SOD activity. The scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that the lateral cilia in the
   gill aperture were well developed during the MCs exposure period, which
   could perform the filter-feeding function instead of the damaged frontal
   cilium. This study provides insight into the possible tolerance of C.
   fluminea exposed to dense bloom concentrations of M. aeruginosa.},

Abstract = {Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) has proved problematic in Irish king
   scallop, Pecten maximus fisheries necessitating restrictions on the sale
   of fresh scallops (in-shell), which achieve a higher market price than
   frozen processed product. An investigation of variability in domoic acid
   (DA) concentration in king scallop from 69 sampling sites within a
   limited area off the southeast coast of Ireland was performed. Variation
   in DA concentration was examined in the whole area, within smaller
   sub-areas, with size, age, and water depth. Mean DA concentrations in
   whole scallop ranged from 6.5 to 154.3 mu g g(-1), with an overall mean
   of 40.6 +/- 30.8 mu g g(-1). The concentration in gonad exceeded 20 mu g
   g(-1) in 17 sites and in adductor muscle in 3 sites. Significant
   differences in DA concentration were detected between scallops from
   different sampling stations. Whole scallop tissue and individual scallop
   tissues with the exception of gonad, exhibited significant negative
   correlations with water depth. Highest DA concentrations were recorded
   in inshore, shallow sites and lowest DA concentrations in deeper
   offshore waters. Significant positive correlations between DA
   concentration in hepatopancreas and scallop size were exhibited at
   inshore sites but not at offshore sites. High inter-animal and spatial
   variability in toxin concentration demonstrated the importance of a
   reliable sampling protocol for the management of ASP outbreaks to ensure
   public safety and to avoid unnecessary fishery closures. (c) 2006

Title = {BIOACCUMULATIVE POTENTIAL AND TOXICITY OF ENDOSULFAN INSECTICIDE TO
   NONTARGET ANIMALS},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY \& PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {105},
Number = {3},
Pages = {347-361},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Endosulfan insecticide is a polychlorinated compound used for
   controlling a variety of insects; it is practically water-insoluble, but
   readily adheres to clay particles and persists in soil and water for
   several years. Its mode of action involves repetitive nerve-discharges
   positively correlated to increase in temperature. This compound is
   extremely toxic to most fish and can cause massive mortalities. In fish,
   it causes marked changes in Na and K concentrations, decrease in blood
   Ca2+ and Mg levels and inhibits Na, K and Mg-dependent ATPase (in
   brain),
   2. Bioaccumulation of endosulfan is reported for marine animals;
   however, freshwater animals (e.g. crayfish) accumulate it to some
   extent, but they lose the compound rapidly during depuration. Endosulfan
   is generally less toxic to aquatic invertebrates than fish. However, it
   causes decreases in adenylate energy charge, oxygen consumption,
   hemolymph amino acids, succinate dehydrogenase, heart-beat (mussel) and
   altered osmoregulation.
   3. Generally, mammals are less susceptible to endosulfan's toxicity than
   aquatic animals. The majority of studies conducted on laboratory mammals
   can be summarized. (a) Neurotoxicity: male rats are more sensitive than
   females to endosulfan, which decreases brain and plasma
   acetylcholinesterase activity. Endosulfan I (a metabolite) causes a
   significant change in norepinephrine, 5-HT and GABA. (b) Renal toxicity:
   inhibition of MFOs activity was noticed in rats; other effects included
   changes in proximal convoluted tubules and necrosis of the tubular
   epithelium. (c) Hepatotoxicity: chemically-induced aminopyrine
   N-demethylase and aniline hydrolase were found in rat liver, and
   reduction in the glycogen level occurred. (d) Hematologic toxicity:
   endosulfan exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the
   erythrocyte glutathione reductase, hemoglobin amount, RBC number and
   mean corpuscular volume.
   4. Respiratory toxicity: involved dyspnea, acute emphysema, cyanosis and
   hemorrhages in the interalveolar partitions of rat's lungs.
   5. Biochemical: in rats, endosulfan caused increased glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase activity, blood glucose level, phospholipid contents of
   the microsomal and surfactant system, and profoundly induced the
   activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and cytosolic glutathione
   S-transferases. It also decreased significantly Na+, K+ and Mg2+
   ATPases, plasma calcium level and alkaline phosphatase in the intestinal
   epithelium.
   6. Immunologic toxicity: rat serum antibody titer to tetanus toxin, IgG,
   IgM and gammaglobulins were significantly reduced.
   7. Reproductive toxicity: degenerative changes in the seminiferous
   epithelium, induction of the rate-limiting in testosterone production
   (3beta-hydroxysteroid transferase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid
   transferase), histological changes in reproductive organs, testicular
   atrophy and the occurrence of ovarian cysts were noticed in rat.
   Reduction in the weight of secondary sex organ was also observed.
   8. Developmental, teratogenic and genotoxicity: this insecticide caused
   a significant increase in the fetal resorption of rats. Skeletal
   abnormalities included underweight fetuses, small 4th and 5th unossified
   sternabrae. No fetotoxic or teratogenic activity was found in rabbits;
   however, in chickens, egg-hatchability and sterility occurred due to
   antimitotic activity. Endosulfan caused significant chromosomal
   aberrations in mouse and hamster bone-marrow cells and damage to
   spermatozoa cells. In Drosophila, sex-linked recessive lethals were
   noticed. In mice, dominant lethal mutations occurred; increase in
   abnormal sperm and decrease in count occurred.
   9. Carcinogenic toxicity: not reported to be carcinogenic in B6C3F mice
   or humans by any route of exposure.
   10. Toxicity to humans: endosulfan exposure has exhibited epileptic
   effects, hyperactivity, irritability, tremors, convulsions and paralysis
   in humans. A suicidal attempt by a 20-year old male who ingested 30\%
   endosulfan caused hypoxia, followed by recurrent aspiration pneumonia,
   episodes of tachycardiogenic shock which was preceded by tachycardia and
   hypertension.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Ingestion of water contaminated with the cyanotoxin, microcystin (MC),
   can pose serious health risks to humans. MC is also known to accumulate
   in seafood; however, this exposure pathway is much less understood. A
   fundamental element of this uncertainty is related to analytical
   difficulties. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
   (ELISAs) offer one of the best options for routine MC detection, but
   methods of detecting MC in tissue are far from standardized. We spiked
   freshwater finfish and marine mussel tissues with MC, then compared
   recovery rates using four different preparation protocols and two ELISA
   types (polyclonal anti-MC-ADDA/direct monoclonal (DM)). Preparation
   protocol, type of ELISA, and seafood tissue variety significantly
   affected MC detection. This is the first known study to use DM ELISA for
   tissue analyses, and our findings demonstrate that DM ELISA combined
   with a short solvent extraction results in fewer false positives than
   other commonly used methods. This method can be used for rapid and
   reliable MC detection in seafood.},

Abstract = {A total of 133 shellfish samples were collected in seven cities of
   Shandong Province, China, from May to October, 2019. The domoic acid
   (DA) concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and their distribution characteristics were
   investigated. DA concentration was detected high in over 1/3 (36.1\%) of
   the samples of four kinds of shellfish in all three seasons in range
   from 0 to 102 mu g/kg. The highest DA concentrations were 102, 101,
   36.7, and 10.2 mu g/kg in Crassostrea gigas, Chlamys farreri, Mactra
   veneriformis, and Mytilus edulis, respectively. Geographically, Yantai
   (22.0 mu g/kg) and Weihai (16.9 mu g/kg) showed relatively high
   concentrations of DA, whereas Rizhao and Dongying presented only 0.85-
   and 1.76-mu g/kg DA, respectively. DA concentrations in the shellfish
   samples were strongly related to seasonal changes, being significantly
   higher in autumn and summer than that in spring. The DA risk exposure
   assessments indicate that dietary seafood consumption did not pose a
   health threat to general human population. In addition, three isomers
   (isoA, isoD, isoE) and 5 `-epimer DA were detected in 3.00\%-15.80\% of
   the shellfish samples. This study is the first to observe DA and its
   isomers in shellfish samples of Shandong Province. The results
   demonstrate that DA contamination is very common and should be
   continuously monitored.},

Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms in Chinese waters have caused serious domoic acid
   (DA) contamination in shellfish. Although shellfish are at particular
   risk of dietary exposure to DA, there have been no systematic DA risk
   assessments in Chinese coastal waters. A total of 451 shellfish samples
   were collected from March to November 2020. The presence of DA and four
   of its isomers were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. The spatial-temporal distribution of DA occurrence and its
   potential health risks were examined. DA was detected in 198 shellfish
   samples (43.90\%), with a maximum level of 942.86 mu g/kg. DA was
   recorded in all 14 shellfish species tested and Pacific oysters
   (Crassostrea gigas) showed the highest average DA concentration (82.36
   mu g/kg). The DA concentrations in shellfish showed distinct
   spatial-temporal variations, with significantly higher levels of
   occurrence in autumn than in summer and spring (p < 0.01), and
   particularly high occurrence in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. The
   detection rates and maximum concentrations of the four DA isomers were
   low. While C. gigas from Guangdong Province in September showed the
   highest levels of DA contamination, the risk to human consumers was low.
   This study improves our understanding of the potential risk of shellfish
   exposure to DA-residues.},

Title = {Why are bivalves not detoxified?},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {57},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Paralytic (PSP), diarrheic (DSP), and amnesic shellfish poisonings are
   among the most prominent foodborne diseases threatening the food
   security. Because of the absence of legal methods capable of eliminating
   these biotoxins, the option is to rely on natural detoxification,
   compromising the availability of protein-based food and imposing severe
   socioeconomic impacts. In vivo detoxification methodologies have focused
   on the use of adsorbents (mainly applied to PSP), some of which are
   combined with nontoxic algae. Alternative methodologies for DSP have
   emerged, but they are based on absorption inhibition, which may be
   unfeasible in real situations. It is thus imperative to optimize
   existing proposals or develop novel, safe, and cost-effective methods so
   that the solution is seen as an attractive financial investment.},

Abstract = {Microcystins accumulate in aquatic organisms and can be transferred to
   higher trophic levels, eventually affecting vector animals and
   consumers. We examined three levels of an aquatic food chain
   (Microcystis aeruginosa, Daphnia magna and Macrobrachium rosenbergii) to
   identify the transfer efficiency and risk of microcystin on prawns.
   Samples were analysed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (MS)/MS and microcystin-LR (MC-LR) distributions in prawn
   tissues were studied. The results showed that prawns accumulate MC-LR
   both directly from M. aeruginosa and indirectly through D. magna which
   was pre-exposed to M. aeruginosa. MC-LR was detected in the gills,
   digestive tracts and hepatopancreas of the prawns 2 h after exposure.
   MC-LR accumulated in prawns to 0.49 +/- 0.04 lg g(-1) dry weight in
   hepatopancreas within 24 h, while it was not detected in muscle samples,
   and rarely appeared in blood samples in such a short period. Although
   MC-LR was not detected in muscle, the head including hepatopancreas of
   the prawns accumulated troublesome amounts of MC-LR. These results
   demonstrate that microcystis blooms in prawn farming potentially pose a
   risk to human consumers, although prawns may be exposed to the bloom for
   a very short time, hence regular monitoring of blue green algae
   population is recommended.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the in vivo effects of microcystins on gene
   expression of several phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP) in the
   freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea with two different exposure
   scenarios. Clams were exposed for 96 h to 5 mu g L-1 of dissolved
   microcystin-LR and the relative changes of gene expression of three
   different types of PPP (PPP1, 2 and 4) were analyzed by quantitative
   real-time PCR. The results showed a significant induction of PPP2 gene
   expression in the visceral mass. In contrast, the cyanotoxin did not
   cause any significant changes on PPP1 and PPP4 gene expression. Based on
   these results, we studied alterations in transcriptional patterns in
   parallel with enzymatic activity of C. fluminea for PPP2, induced by a
   Microcystis aeruginosa toxic strain (1 x 10(5) cells cm(-3)) during 96
   h. The relative changes of gene expression and enzyme activity in
   visceral mass were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and
   colorimetric assays respectively. The clams exhibited a significant
   reduction of PPP2 activity with a concomitant enhancement of gene
   expression. Considering all the results we can conclude that the
   exposure to an ecologically relevant concentration of pure or
   intracellular microcystins (-LR) promoted an in vivo effect on PPP2 gene
   expression in C. fluminea.},

Abstract = {The mussel Perna viridisis used in the Philippine saxitoxin monitoring
   program as an indicator organism for the presence of saxitoxin in
   shellfish in an effort to assess concentration beyond a level considered
   safe for public consumption. Saxitoxin bioaccumulates in mussels through
   ingestion of saxitoxin-producing algae Pyrodinium bahamense var.
   compressum(Pbc). This study focuses on the relationship between mussel
   length and mussel toxicity in mussels exposed to a natural bloom of Pbc.
   Mussel toxicity was assessed weekly in a 134-day sampling period using
   Receptor Binding Assay (RBA). Smaller mussels are more toxic than larger
   mussels at low Pbc cell density (approximate to 10(2) cells/L) and the
   reverse is true at higher Pbc cell density (approximate to 5x10(3)
   cells/L). These results can be useful in developing strategies for the
   collection of mussel samples in a toxic algal bloom monitoring program.
